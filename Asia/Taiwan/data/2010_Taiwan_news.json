But a deeper shift has been going on \u2013 the rise and rise of China and other key economies grouped under the banner of &quot;emerging&quot;. Indeed, the growing political and economic muscle of China was highlighted by its recent intransigence at the Copenhagen climate talks, where it refused to be forced into any binding agreement to reduce its emissions. While many economists have grown used to the idea that the US economy \u2013 still the world&apos;s biggest \u2013 is the locomotive of the global economy, it is China, helped by a huge fiscal stimulus from Beijing last year, which is roaring ahead and helping to drag the rest of Asia and countries such as Germany, which exports a lot of machine tools to China, out of recession too. China is one of the key reasons the world did not experience an even worse 2009 than it actually did. China is not alone; other Asian countries that are booming include Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan. But in terms of sheer size and importance, key emerging economies now include Brazil, Russia and India. Together with China, these are known as the Brics, a term coined by Jim O&apos;Neill at Goldman Sachs early in the Noughties to denote their growing economic importance. Their rising power stands in sharp contrast to struggling European economies such as Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain, known collectively, if unkindly, as the Pigs. (The list is often extended to include Italy, but PIIGS makes for an untidy acronym.) The Brics now account for 15% of the global economy, more than half of the size of the US. As O&apos;Neill points out, China has overtaken Germany to become the world&apos;s third-largest economy and is likely to move into second place, ahead of Japan, over the next year or so. By 2030 it is likely to have eclipsed the US as the world&apos;s top economy. Brazil will overtake France and Britain to become the world&apos;s fifth-largest economy by 2025 at the latest. Along with India and Russia, it has overtaken or is about to overtake Canada, a member of the G7 leading economies. No wonder the G20, which includes the Brics, has been recognised as the primary forum for global economic discussions. All the Brics are set to grow strongly.Goldman also lays to rest the myth that Americans are the world&apos;s &quot;consumers of last resort&quot;, forecasting that the Brics, rather than simply being huge exporters, are likely to account for almost half of global consumption growth in 2010. &quot;We expect income per capita to continue to rise in the Brics and spending power to shift from the richest countries towards a growing middle-income bloc, comprising emerging markets in general and the Brics in particular,&quot; it says. But while most of the impact of emerging economies is benign, that cannot be said for China. Some economists say its emergence on to the world stage brought with it a key reason for the global economic meltdown between 2007 and 2009. For similar reasons, its successful integration into the global economy will likely define the success of the new decade. Holding down its exchange rate to make its exports cheaper meant China built up huge current account surpluses, which it reinvested in the government bonds of countries such as the US, helping to push down long-term interest rates and pump up the American economy, sucking in even more Chinese imports. The flip side of its surpluses were current account deficits in many western countries, in particular Britain and the US. Cheap Chinese goods kept western shoppers buying and inflation low, letting central banks such as the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England hold interest rates low, thus pumping up the prices of assets such as shares and housing. This cheap, plentiful credit is blamed by many for ultimately leading to the peddling by banks of sub-prime mortgages and derivatives based on them, all of which collapsed with devastating results. In his recently-published book The Trouble with Markets, veteran economist Roger Bootle argues that a rebalancing of the global economy, with countries such as Britain and the US reducing their current account deficits and China shrinking its surplus, will be key to a successful next decade. The alternative \u2013 protectionism and trade wars \u2013 could be disastrous. &quot;China is sitting on a time bomb,&quot; he said. &quot;Choosing to run a huge surplus means other countries have to run huge deficits. Unless China acts to boost consumption and reduce its reliance on a large trade surplus, the west will achieve the latter for China by imposing protectionist measures, and the Chinese will be left trying to achieve the former in an atmosphere of deep economic and political crisis.&quot; Chinese leaders have been browbeaten about the value of their currency for several years and in 2005 decided to let it rise in value. Results so far have been mixed, at best. Over the past 10 months, for example, it has fallen by 14% against the euro. Its trade-weighted value is now back to its 2002 level. The value of the yuan will be arguably the most important thing to watch over the next decade."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jan/04/burj-dubai-height-architecture", "publicationDate": "2010-01-04T16:47:55Z", "tags": ["Burj Khalifa", "Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Culture", "Dubai", "Dubai holidays"], "sentences": ["It&apos;s a new order of tallness, even compared with its nearest rival, Taiwan&apos;s Taipei 101, which it exceeds by more than 300 metres."], "title": "Burj Dubai is the height of architecture \u2013 just don't look down", "article": "We&apos;re going to need a new word. The Burj Dubai doesn&apos;t scrape the sky; it pierces it like a slender silver needle, half a mile high. It&apos;s only because Dubai never has any clouds that we can even see the tower&apos;s top. And, judging by the images released so far, the view is more like looking out of a plane than a building. It has made reality a little less real. The facts and figures about the tower are equally surreal \u2013 like the one about how it could be eight degrees cooler at the top than at the bottom, or the one about how you could watch the sunset at the bottom, then take a lift up to the top and watch it all over again. It&apos;s a new order of tallness, even compared with its nearest rival, Taiwan&apos;s Taipei 101, which it exceeds by more than 300 metres. But, beyond height, is there anything to celebrate here? From our current perspective, the Burj Dubai symbolises catastrophic excess \u2013 of money, confidence, ambition, energy consumption. And the fact that it will most likely stand empty for years to come has been noted with great satisfaction here in the west. But isn&apos;t this how we&apos;ve responded to every tall structure of note, from Babel onwards? And even its many critics have to admit the tower is a rather stunning piece of architecture. Chiefly designed by Adrian Smith, formerly of skyscraper specialists SOM, and engineer Bill Baker, it is beautifully sleek and elegant, rising in a graceful series of silver tubes of different heights. It looks less like a single tower than a cluster of towers, an organic formation rather than a self-consciously iconic object. This is surely the best-looking tall building since New York&apos;s Chrysler and the Empire State buildings in the 1930s. In environmental terms, the Burj Dubai is way too tall to justify itself, but there is at least some structural efficiency to the form. Its Y-shaped plan \u2013 three wings extending from a central core, like the roots of a tree \u2013 &quot;confuses the wind&quot;, in the architects&apos; words, while the core stops the wings from twisting (which would give top-floor occupants nausea). For super-tall buildings \u2013 and surely there will be more, one day \u2013 this &quot;buttressed core&quot; design is likely to become the prevailing form. More worrying than the tower itself, however, is what&apos;s around it. In 1956, Frank Lloyd Wright unveiled a scheme for an elegantly preposterous mile-high skyscraper for Chicago, safe in the knowledge that he&apos;d never have to figure out how to build it. It was undoubtedly an influence on the Burj Dubai. It even had a similar triangular structure. But Wright&apos;s intentions with his mile-high skyscraper were to create a concentrated human habitat, the better to halt Chicago&apos;s unstoppable urban sprawl, and free up ground space for parks, nature and leisure. The Burj Dubai, by contrast, has become the tentpole for several more acres of anonymous, soulless, energy-hungry cityscape. You can apparently see for 60 miles from the top, but when you look down, the immediate landscape is the same schematic real-estate tat you see everywhere else in Dubai: vast shopping malls, bland office towers, sprawling residential developments semi-themed to resemble &quot;traditional&quot; Arabian villages, outsized ornamental fountains. The Burj Dubai might be a triumph vertically, but what about the horizontal?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/06/china-sued-piracy-green-dam", "publicationDate": "2010-01-06T11:42:09Z", "tags": ["Green Dam", "China", "Internet", "Technology", "Censorship", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["AP said spokespeople for Sony and Taiwan&apos;s BenQ said they had no details of the lawsuit and could not comment.", "Taiwan&apos;s Acer and China&apos;s Haier Group declined to comment, while Toshiba and Taiwan&apos;s ASUSTeK Computer did not respond to queries."], "title": "US software firm sues China over Green Dam piracy", "article": "A US firm is suing China for alleged piracy of internet filtering software, claiming that lines of code were copied for the controversial Green Dam censorship program. Cybersitter, which produces software to help parents filter content for their children, filed a $2.2bn (\u00a31.4bn) lawsuit in a federal court in Los Angeles yesterday. The company names the Chinese government, two Chinese software firms and seven computer makers in the suit. Chinese officials said last year that the Green Dam Youth Escort program would be mandatory on all new computers in China, but backed away at the last minute after an outcry by internet users, foreign governments and businesses. Beijing said it was targeting pornography and violence. But experts said the program denied access to politically sensitive material, collected private data from internet users and was highly vulnerable to security breaches. A research team at the University of Michigan in the US reported at the time that Green Dam appeared to use blacklist files derived from Cybersitter, but soon afterwards said that an update appeared to have disabled the files. Gregory Fayer, a lawyer representing the US firm, told Associated Press: &quot;I don&apos;t think I have ever seen such clearcut stealing.&quot; He alleged that Chinese software makers appeared to have copied more than 3,000 lines of code. &quot;They did a sloppy job,&quot; he added, noting that they included directions on how to get to the Cybersitter website. The suit alleges misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair competition, copyright infringement and conspiracy. It also claims the Chinese software makers broke US laws governing economic espionage. Cybersitter is also suing manufacturers including Sony, Lenovo and Toshiba on the grounds that they distributed Green Dam with PCs sold in China. The other firms named are Acer, ASUSTeK, BenQ and Haier. The Chinese government had ordered computer makers to include the software. Cybersitter&apos;s lawsuit alleges that manufacturers continued to distribute the program after learning of the piracy claims. Fayer said that none of the defendants had been served with the lawsuit yet. China&apos;s foreign ministry referred questions to the ministry of industry and information technology, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Lenovo Group spokeswoman told AP by email that the firm was unable to comment on pending litigation, adding that it had not shipped Green Dam with PCs for several months. AP said spokespeople for Sony and Taiwan&apos;s BenQ said they had no details of the lawsuit and could not comment. Taiwan&apos;s Acer and China&apos;s Haier Group declined to comment, while Toshiba and Taiwan&apos;s ASUSTeK Computer did not respond to queries. But the Financial Times quoted ASUSTeK as saying the program came from a mainland Chinese company and that they were trying to resolve the issue legally. The chief executive of one of the Chinese software makers being sued, Zhengzhou Jinhui Computer System Engineering, did not answer phone calls. The firm has previously denied any wrongdoing. A representative of the other software maker named in the lawsuit, Beijing Dazheng Human Language Technology Academy, was not available when AP called. Fayer said Cybersitter was seeking damages for royalties due on its product, which sold for $39.95 a copy. He said the case could be &quot;a watershed for the protection of American intellectual property internationally. &quot;We don&apos;t make many widgets anymore,&quot; he said. &quot;What we have to offer the world is our ingenuity and creativity, our ideas and what lawyers call intellectual property \u2026 It is important that they be protected.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/12/china-tests-missile-interceptor", "publicationDate": "2010-01-12T07:50:31Z", "tags": ["China", "Weapons technology", "Science", "US news", "US military", "US foreign policy", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The announcement came amid repeated complaints from Beijing over the US sale of weaponry including Patriot PAC-3 air defence missiles to Taiwan.", "Patriots can destroy missiles in mid-air, and could be used against those deployed along the Chinese coastline facing Taiwan.", "&quot;This is confirmation of the message that China fully intends to have the panoply of contemporary military technology at its disposal.&quot; Huisken said that the point of such technology was to counter US rather than Taiwanese capabilities, adding: &quot;My interpretation is that the Chinese were ready to run a test and decided this was as good an excuse as any.&quot; Analysts believe China has used foreign weaponry to develop a number of programmes domestically.", "A commentary issued by Xinhua yesterday \u2013 separately from the report on the test \u2013 warned: &quot;Each time the United States has sold weapons to Taiwan, there has been huge damage to China-US relations.", "&quot;This US arms sale to Taiwan will be no exception.&quot; It urged the Obama administration to immediately halt weapons sales to avoid damaging cooperation in &quot;important areas&quot;.", "China curtailed military-to-military contacts with the US after then president George Bush notified Congress in October 2008 of plans to sell Taiwan a long-delayed arms package valued at up to $6.4bn (\u00a34bn).", "&quot;We have the power and ability to adopt counter-measures [against US arms sales to Taiwan],&quot; Jin Yinan, a major-general in the People&apos;s Liberation Army and professor at China&apos;s National Defence University wrote earlier this month."], "title": "China 'successfully tests missile interceptor'", "article": "China successfully tested new technology to intercept missiles in flight yesterday, state media has reported. The announcement came amid repeated complaints from Beijing over the US sale of weaponry including Patriot PAC-3 air defence missiles to Taiwan. In a terse three-sentence report, the official Xinhua news agency reported late last night that &quot;ground-based midcourse missile interception technology&quot; was tested within Chinese territory. &quot;The test has achieved the expected objective,&quot; it added, without specifying whether the missile had been destroyed, although the US reported detecting a collision. Xinhua added: &quot;The test is defensive in nature and is not targeted at any country.&quot; The report, which was issued unusually quickly, followed days of criticism of the US arms sales. Patriots can destroy missiles in mid-air, and could be used against those deployed along the Chinese coastline facing Taiwan. The island has been self-ruled since the defeated nationalists fled there at the end of the civil war, but China still asserts its sovereignty and has warned it could use military action if the island sought formal independence. In Washington, the defence department said the US did not consider the test related to the arms sales. &quot;We did not receive prior notification of the launch,&quot; Maj Maureen Schumann, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said. &quot;We detected two geographically separated missile launch events with an exo-atmospheric collision also being observed by space-based sensors. We are requesting information from China regarding the purpose for conducting this interception as well as China&apos;s intentions and plans to pursue future types of intercepts.&quot; Missile technology has been one focus of the Chinese military&apos;s modernisation drive, funded by double-digit rises in defence spending for several years running. Last year China&apos;s military budget rose 14.9%, to 480.6bn yuan (\u00a344bn). &quot;[The test] indicates a huge scale of ambition,&quot; said Ron Huisken, of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at the Australian National University, adding that intercepting missiles in flight was &quot;fiendishly difficult to do&quot;. &quot;This is confirmation of the message that China fully intends to have the panoply of contemporary military technology at its disposal.&quot; Huisken said that the point of such technology was to counter US rather than Taiwanese capabilities, adding: &quot;My interpretation is that the Chinese were ready to run a test and decided this was as good an excuse as any.&quot; Analysts believe China has used foreign weaponry to develop a number of programmes domestically. &quot;There is an obvious concern in Beijing that they need an effective anti-ballistic missile defence in some form,&quot; Hans Kristensen, an expert on the Chinese military with the Federation of American Scientists, told AP. Staging a successful test &quot;shows that their technology is maturing&quot;, Kristensen said. The test was also a way of signalling their capabilities, he added. A commentary issued by Xinhua yesterday \u2013 separately from the report on the test \u2013 warned: &quot;Each time the United States has sold weapons to Taiwan, there has been huge damage to China-US relations. &quot;This US arms sale to Taiwan will be no exception.&quot; It urged the Obama administration to immediately halt weapons sales to avoid damaging cooperation in &quot;important areas&quot;. China curtailed military-to-military contacts with the US after then president George Bush notified Congress in October 2008 of plans to sell Taiwan a long-delayed arms package valued at up to $6.4bn (\u00a34bn). &quot;We have the power and ability to adopt counter-measures [against US arms sales to Taiwan],&quot; Jin Yinan, a major-general in the People&apos;s Liberation Army and professor at China&apos;s National Defence University wrote earlier this month.

In the past 12 months the Great Fire Wall \u2013 China&apos;s system of restricting foreign content \u2013 has been raised to keep out Twitter and Facebook. Many other sites, such as YouTube, were already blocked. Within China censors stepped up their efforts to limit information available to an increasingly connected nation by expanding lists of taboo subjects, putting pressure on internet service providers (ISPs) and arresting several high-profile journalists and free speech campaigners who refused to toe the line. The Guardian&apos;s Chinese language service, the Weibao, was taken offline without explanation at the end of last year when the site of its translation partner, Yeeyan, was removed by its internet service provider. Last June the government attempted to install &quot;Green Dam&quot; censorship software in every computer that would deny access to sites with pornographic or politically sensitive content. The plan was postponed at the last minute after a backlash by Chinese netizens, computer makers and foreign governments, but the authorities are said to be still keen to introduce such a system. After riots erupted in the far western region of Xinjiang in the summer, the authorities completely shut down the internet in the capital, Urumqi, and restricted mobile phone messaging. Services were only resumed in the past month. Google, along with other companies that operate within the Great Firewall, must follow the orders of the Communist party propaganda department. Their executives meet with Chinese officials who tell them &quot;which way the wind is blowing&quot; on sensitive topics such as Tibet, Taiwan, Tiananmen and Falun Gong. Many website operators compile lists of terms that might get them in trouble with the authorities and filter them from their content. Almost nothing is made public, which means there is an invisible line between what is acceptable and prohibited. This results in massive self-censorship. Criticism of China&apos;s actions at the Copenhagen climate summit is thought to be off-limits. At least one website operator flags up even the word &quot;China&quot; because stories about the nation are potentially sensitive. Google has been criticised by the authorities and sporadic breaks in its Chinese service have been widely seen as a form of temporary punishment for failing to heed the orders of the censors. It faces unfair competition with Baidu, the local rival search engine that is far more compliant. Censorship was high on the agenda when Barack Obama made his first visit to China in November. In a town hall meeting in Shanghai the US president described himself as a as &quot;a big supporter of non-censorship&quot; and said criticism made him a better president. &quot;I think that the more freely information flows, the stronger the society becomes, because then citizens of countries around the world can hold their own governments accountable,&quot; Obama said. &quot;They can begin to think for themselves.&quot; Many Chinese netizens find ways to &quot;climb the firewall&quot; by using proxies and VPNs to access blocked websites overseas. Some, such as the artist Ai Weiwei, rail against censorship and the sanitised domestic news offerings. The government has tried to scare off such challenges by imprisoning high-profile campaigners. The Tibetan film-maker Dhongdup Wangchen was recently jailed for six years for a critical documentary about Tibet. Liu Xiaobo was handed an 11-year sentence for instigating a campaign for constitutional reform, including greater freedom of expression. Zhao Lianhai is awaiting trial after using the internet to campaign for justice over the poisoned milk scandal of 2008."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/jan/13/china-google-information-technology-michael-white", "publicationDate": "2010-01-13T09:40:40Z", "tags": ["Politics", "UK news", "China", "Google", "World news", "Technology", "Internet", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Too many cyber-attacks to track dissidents and \u2013 as Tania explains \u2013 sensitive topics such as &quot;Taiwan&quot;, &quot;Tibet&quot; and &quot;buy corpses&quot; (official body part sales), Google has decided: it&apos;s no longer worth the compromises it embraced in 2006."], "title": "China and Google: Inability to deal with new technology helped hobble the USSR | Michael White", "article": "Do great powers all make the same fatal mistakes? It&apos;s tempting to say yes at a time when the United States is still busily fulfilling Geordie historian Paul Kennedy&apos;s &quot;imperial overstretch&quot; prediction, which so enraged Ronald Reaganauts in the 1980s. So how about Google&apos;s decision to withdraw its tactical complicity in official censorship of its search engines in China, which Tania Branigan reports on today&apos;s Guardian front page? Too many cyber-attacks to track dissidents and \u2013 as Tania explains \u2013 sensitive topics such as &quot;Taiwan&quot;, &quot;Tibet&quot; and &quot;buy corpses&quot; (official body part sales), Google has decided: it&apos;s no longer worth the compromises it embraced in 2006. It may \u2013 may \u2013 pull out altogether. Admirers of modern China insist that the country is different. My old colleague Jonathan Fenby, who has turned himself into a prolific Sinologist since editing the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong, assured me at a Christmas party that China does not have expansionist goals; its preoccupation, as ever, is China. Given Beijing&apos;s restless search for raw materials, which dictates much of its foreign policy \u2013 in Africa and the Middle East as well as East Asia \u2013 I remain sceptical of that proposition, though I suppose the Google row could be located within its parameters. It&apos;s an internal matter for us alone, officials might argue \u2013 and will. China is reaching out to the world in countless ways \u2013 that Olympic games success, all those students studying abroad, or following Manchester United. But internal security and dissent is too important to leave unchecked. Only last week I took a call from a young Chinese man, ringing from Beijing and speaking near-perfect English, who wanted me to join a TV studio discussion \u2013 down the phone line \u2013 about global reaction to China&apos;s execution of Akmal Shaikh, the British man convicted of drug smuggling. I&apos;m wary of dealing with media in authoritarian states and prefer live interviews that go out on English-language channels for international consumption, a market that China has now entered. There&apos;s less chance for misrepresentation. On air I was cautious, acknowledging that capital punishment for drug dealers would probably be popular in Britain too and stressing that it is quite common for foreigners to criticise a country&apos;s judicial system when it produces a controversial outcome. I cited American reaction to Amanda Fox&apos;s murder conviction in Perugia. All the same, it&apos;s an important crossroads for China. One of the weaknesses that increasingly hobbled the old Soviet Union before its collapse after 1989 was its inability to deal with the emerging information technologies and their consequences. A state that couldn&apos;t guarantee a regular supply of bog paper for its citizens but felt the need to guard its (primitive) copying machines wasn&apos;t a serious long-term threat. The new Putin-KGB model of energy-dependant strength still doesn&apos;t address the freedom issue, does it? The screws are being tightened again. But China was always more interesting, more subtle. Even in the centuries of degradation at the hands of the expansionist western powers, the Middle Kingdom saw itself as just that, complacently so as it turned out. It is an error Washington should absorb. Barack Obama seems to get the point, enraging the &quot;America first&quot; crowd in the process. Continental isolationism has deep roots in American culture too \u2013 the same impulses that prompted the (prosperous) Ming dynasty to turn its back on the world in the 15th century. You can see the consequences at work in today&apos;s Guardian, the beautiful reproduction of Jesuit Matteo Ricci&apos;s (1552-1610) map of the known world in 1602, newly on display at the Library of Congress. It&apos;s a pretty accurate map by the standards of the time \u2013 all the bits in the right place, China and the Americas included. Who was it made for? The Ming emperor Wanli. But the cartographer was a foreigner, an Italian who arrived as a missionary in 1583, having first learned Mandarin. Ricci later moved to Beijing, bringing a chiming clock to the court where he did not meet the emperor in person but was allowed inside the Forbidden City \u2013 where he taught officials western ways, including music \u2013 and adopted Chinese garb. Buried there, he remains a respected figure. Western music, which the Chinese do rather well, and Ricci&apos;s missionary Catholicism (banned in 1724) reverberate through China to this day. Crucial decisions can impact for centuries, can&apos;t they? So it&apos;s worth repeating that Gutenberg&apos;s invention of the printing press in the 1450s \u2013 the internet is arguably the most important communications tool since then \u2013 spread like wildfire throughout Europe, contributing to its later global dominance. The mighty Ottoman empire banned it throughout its Muslim domain in the Middle East \u2013 and has been struggling to catch up ever since. Chinese history records the first book-burning as early as 221 BC. But all societies have censorship issues, including our own right up to today. Gutenberg&apos;s Europe struggled with censorship for centuries \u2013 much of its against the baleful influence of the Catholic church, not to mention totalitarian secular regimes. Diversity and competition always helps. We don&apos;t have to believe today&apos;s Guardian; we can read the Times or Daily Mail to cross-check it. Let&apos;s hope the Chinese think about it and try harder to go with the great flow of global information."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/13/haiti-earthquake-un-death-toll", "publicationDate": "2010-01-13T20:25:48Z", "tags": ["Haiti", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "United Nations", "World news", "Americas", "Earthquakes"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s embassy was destroyed and Spain&apos;s badly damaged."], "title": "Just the end of a busy, humid day in Haiti - then everything changed", "article": "     It was still hot but the sun was slowly dipping into the Caribbean, casting shadows over Port-au-Prince. The narrow streets, clogged at the best of times, were filled with office workers and schoolchildren weaving through traffic. It was peak time for the tap-taps, buses painted with bright colours and religious messages. Haiti&apos;s capital is a study in extremes \u2013 hillside slums of squalor overlook fancy hotels and United Nations compounds \u2013 but with the working day all but done most inhabitants shared the same thought: head home. Just another humid, busy afternoon, the aroma of fried plantain from street stalls mixing with diesel fumes and the babble of more than 3 million voices. At 4.53pm, everything changed. &quot;The entire mountain seemed to fall down all around me,&quot; said Emmet \u00adMurphy, a US charity worker who was driving out of the city. &quot;People were panicking, buildings collapsed on the roadside and a huge dust plume raised from the valley floor.&quot; The magnitude 7.0 earthquake, the most powerful to strike Port-au-Prince in two centuries, shook the earth for about a minute, but even before it finished thousands of buildings had collapsed. Devastation so instant, so thorough, that survivors struggled for words. &quot;Downtown Port-au-Prince is lost, dust and rumbles,&quot; said Frederic Dupoux, a Twitter user. &quot;Every other house is on the ground. People are terrified and have no hope. Natural holocaust. Dead bodies are everywhere.&quot; People screamed &quot;Jesus! Jesus!&quot; as offices, hotels, houses and shops \u00adcollapsed. The poor, as ever with natural disasters, were the worst hit, especially Belair and the area known as Carrefour, near the sea. &quot;The slums on the hills have completely collapsed. We have heard of landslides, with entire communities being wiped out,&quot; said Sophie Perez, country director for Care International. &quot;We&apos;re particularly worried about the children, because so many schools seem to have collapsed. It&apos;s horrifying.&quot; Soil, dust and smoke smothered the city for about 12 minutes, according to witnesses. When it partly cleared the scene was apocalyptic. Neighbourhoods levelled, shopping centres reduced to rubble, ravines filled with corpses and debris. People streaked white with dust and red with blood wept and staggered, dazed amid an alien landscape. It quickly became clear that wealth, prestige and supposedly sturdy buildings were no guarantee of salvation. The dome on what had been a gleaming white presidential palace collapsed on top of flattened walls. President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val and his wife were not inside, and escaped, but the president described stepping over dead bodies and hearing the cries of those trapped inside the collapsed parliament. The senate president was among those pinned under the ruins. Another apparent casualty was Monsignor Joseph Serge Miot, the archbishop of Port-au-Prince, whose body was reportedly found in the wreckage of the archdiocese office. Taiwan&apos;s embassy was destroyed and Spain&apos;s badly damaged. The UN headquarters, based in the former Christopher hotel, was also destroyed, with an estimated 150 people inside. Around 10 people, &quot;some dead, some alive&quot;, were pulled from the rubble, said Alain Le Roy, the head of UN peacekeeping. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said the missing included Hedi Annabi, the Tunisian chief of the UN stabilisation mission in Haiti. The French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, told RTL radio: &quot;It would appear that everyone who was in the building, including my friend Hedi Annabi, are dead.&quot; The 9,000-strong peacekeeping force, which is spread across Haiti, had to deal with its own tragedies before responding to others&apos;. At least 23 Filipino peacekeepers, mostly clerks who tend to be the last to leave the headquarters, were feared dead. At least 11 Brazilian soldiers also died and scores were reported missing. Chinese state media said eight Chinese peacekeepers died and 10 were missing. The Hotel Montana collapsed but the famed Olafson hotel, which partly inspired Graham Greene&apos;s novel The Comedians, was damaged. As night descended, with electricity cut, Port-au-Prince disappeared into an inky blackness punctured by car headlights and the flicker of fires. Ian Rogers of Save the Children said he could hear cries of anguish and mourning. A worldwide effort to race aid to Haiti was about to swing into action, and within hours Barack Obama and Pope Benedict would be among foreign leaders expressing solidarity, but for many in the devastated city there was no immediate relief. Voices cried out from the rubble. &quot;Please take me out, I am dying. I have two children with me,&quot; a female voice pleaded with a Reuters journalist from under a collapsed kindergarten in the Canape-Vert district. Police and rescue vehicles were absent from many areas. &quot;People are trying to dig victims out with flashlights,&quot; said Rachmani Domersant, an operations manager with the Food for the Poor charity. Aftershocks rocked those buildings that still stood, causing fresh panic, but dwindled in power as the night wore on. Phone lines were in tatters but some managed to send tweets. From Karen Ashmore: &quot;Needs to be rescued. Please go help. Trapped in her collapsed house: Jillian Thorpe, Rue Charles Perrault 36, Morne Hercule, Petionville.&quot; The British aid worker was later found alive. Those who could not save the living started taking dead from rubble, a foot here, a hand there, and lined the bodies side by side under a sheet. Survivors peeked under the covers to see if they were friends and relatives. &quot;The whole city is in darkness. You have thousands of people sitting in the streets with nowhere to go. The traffic is jammed,&quot; one eyewitness, Michael Bazile, told CNN. &quot;Everybody is yelling. They are praying. They are crying.&quot; As dawn broke people wandered the streets holding hands. Helicopters whirred overhead \u2013 the first sign of aid. Thousands crammed into hospitals with fractures and burn injuries. A Red Cross spokesman said the organisation was overwhelmed. &quot;There are too many people who need help. We lack equipment, we lack bodybags.&quot; President Pr\u00e9val emerged looking shaken: &quot;It is a catastrophe,&quot; he said. It was still too soon to count the dead but the prime minister, Jean-Max Bellerive, suggested more than 100,000. As the sun set over the ruins of Port-au-Prince the voices from the rubble were fewer and fainter. Other voices, of survivors too weak or exhausted to dig, wafted from public squares. They were singing hymns.

Human rights campaigners, \u00adfreedom of speech advocates and dotcom \u00adentrepreneurs all applauded the \u00adCalifornian company&apos;s decision to stop cooperating with the Chinese government. The move, which threatens to end the internet giant&apos;s business in China after four troubled years, was seen by many as a turning point in the relationship between corporate America and Beijing. Jonathan Zittrain, professor of \u00adinternet law at Harvard and a prominent \u00adanti-censorship activist, said he thought Google could wield significant influence in a fight to bring more uncensored \u00adinformation to Chinese citizens. &quot;In a world in which we are so used to public relations massaging of messages, this stands out as a direct declaration. It&apos;s amazing,&quot; he said. &quot;I think the Chinese are going to say, &apos;bye-bye Google&apos; \u2013 but just think about what happens if Google&apos;s engineers set about making information as accessible as possible in China.&quot; Others agreed the company was \u00adbeginning what could be a wider shift in attitudes. John Battelle, a former managing editor of Wired magazine who covered the rise of Google in his 2005 book The Search, said others could follow. &quot;In this case, Google is again taking a leadership role, and the company is \u00adforcing China&apos;s hand,&quot; he wrote on his blog. &quot;This is politics at its finest, and it&apos;s a very clear statement to China: we&apos;re done playing the game your way.&quot; While many threw their support behind Google&apos;s decision to stop censoring its search index, others \u2013 particularly those with significant business interests in China \u2013 were more circumspect. Most of the company&apos;s major rivals \u2013 including Microsoft \u2013 refused to \u00adcomment on Google&apos;s announcement, while Yahoo released a terse statement in which it denounced the hacking attacks that Google said had prompted the decision. &quot;Yahoo is committed to protecting human rights, privacy and security,&quot; said the company. &quot;We condemn any attempts to infiltrate company networks to obtain user \u00adinformation. We stand aligned with Google that these kinds of attacks are deeply disturbing and strongly believe that the violation of user privacy is \u00adsomething that we as internet pioneers must all oppose.&quot; Microsoft and Yahoo have been \u00adcriticised in the past for their activities in China, which have included removing websites belonging to dissidents, and the handing over of information which led to the jailing of several outspoken critics of the government. In 2007, a congressional inquiry \u00adcriticised Yahoo&apos;s complicity in the \u00adimprisonment of Chinese journalist Shi Tao, \u00adleading to claims that Yahoo&apos;s co-founder Jerry Yang \u2013 who was born in \u00adTaiwan \u2013 had acted as a &quot;moral pygmy&quot; by bowing to pressure from Beijing. But while some leading \u00adtechnology companies have colluded with the \u00adChinese government to silence its political opponents, others have been even more intimately involved in attempts to disrupt and silence dissidents. At the same time that Google was announcing its decision to lift the ban on certain words and phrases, Cisco Systems \u2013 which was instrumental in building the systems used in the Great Firewall of China \u2013 announced plans to increase investment in its businesses in the country. Sarah Lacy, author of the book Once You&apos;re Lucky, Twice You&apos;re Good: The Rebirth of Silicon Valley, and writer for the influential Silicon Valley blog Techcrunch, said Google&apos;s decision was a pragmatic example of dotcom realpolitik, pointing out that Google&apos;s business was not doing well in China. &quot;They&apos;re taking a bad situation and making something good out of it, both from a human and business point of view,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I&apos;m not saying human rights didn&apos;t play into the decision, but this was as much about business.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jan/14/james-lilley-obituary", "publicationDate": "2010-01-14T18:35:54Z", "tags": ["China", "South Korea", "US news", "US foreign policy", "World news", "Politics", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["As vice-president from 1980, Bush was to continue working with Lilley when he headed the American Institute, in effect the US mission in Taiwan.", "He appeared during the inauguration of Ma Ying-Jieo as Taiwanese president in May 2008, but his physical decline was already clear."], "title": "James Lilley obituary", "article": "The US diplomat and sinologist James Lilley, who has died aged 81 of\u00a0complications related to prostate cancer, was tested not once, but twice, in Asian countries undergoing political turbulence at a critical moment. He\u00a0served in South Korea from 1986 to 1989, when it was undergoing the transition towards democracy by holding presidential elections, and in China in 1989, at the time of the tumultuous 4 June demonstrations in\u00a0Tiananmen Square, Beijing. Lilley&apos;s ability to balance the interests and values of the US while not aggravating highly tense situations in both South Korea and China testified to his diplomatic skills. As the key US official on the ground, he maintained lines of communication even in the most critical period, while also forcefully conveying US concerns. That\u00a0America was able to continue talking to China after the massacre, at a time when both sides could have descended into a new cold war, was in no small part due to Lilley. In terms of experience of the region, America had few better qualified. Born in Qingdao, Shandong province, where his father was an executive for Standard Oil and his mother a teacher, Lilley spent his formative years in the chaotic environment of late republican China, witnessing the initial moves in the Sino-Japanese war that were to lead to such tragic and devastating outcomes before its end in 1945. Returning to the US, he studied at Yale and George Washington University, and then in Hong Kong, and served in\u00a0the US army before joining the CIA in\u00a01951. As a CIA operative, Lilley worked throughout Asia, including Laos, Cambodia and Japan. This rich experience was to stand him in good stead when he was appointed to the national intelligence council, working closely with the then head of the newly established US mission in Beijing, George Bush Sr, in the mid-1970s. As vice-president from 1980, Bush was to continue working with Lilley when he headed the American Institute, in effect the US mission in Taiwan. Lilley\u00a0served successfully in South Korea for three years from 1987 during a period in which it was emerging from more than two decades of military rule. His first year in Seoul was to see violent student demonstrations challenging the incumbent rulers. For a few weeks, South Korea teetered on the edge of a relapse into authoritarian rule, but Lilley was able to help this messy process by conveying the US&apos;s support, as the country&apos;s key ally, for democratic change. Direct presidential elections were held later in 1987 and helped to stabilise the situation, leading to South Korea&apos;s emergence in the 1990s as one of the region&apos;s most successful economies and most stable political systems. Only a year after Bush became president, Lilley was sent to Beijing in 1989 as US ambassador. He found himself in an even more difficult situation. Massive student demonstrations from April that year put the China-US relationship under immense pressure and on the night of\u00a04\u00a0June, troops descended on Tiananmen Square, killing many of\u00a0the\u00a0students still gathered there (the\u00a0exact number is still not known). Over the next few days, Lilley managed two things: he expressed revulsion on behalf of the US at the Chinese government&apos;s actions, but maintained strong enough links to ensure that each side stayed in contact. Lilley had one extra complication to deal with. The eminent astrophysicist Fang Lizhi had sought refuge in the US embassy after being placed on a wanted list by the Chinese government, and labelled as a dissident. Deng Xiaoping himself had complained bitterly about Fang&apos;s &quot;incorrect attitude&quot;. Lilley played host to Fang in a couple of rooms in the embassy basement, and undertook months of delicate negotiations before he was able to secure Fang&apos;s release to go first to the UK, and then the US. Bush&apos;s instincts were always to maintain dialogue with China, at all costs, and in Lilley he had the perfect supporter. Both knew that it was not in the US&apos;s long-term interests to cut China off from the west. Maintaining the balancing act of making their opposition to the Chinese government&apos;s handling of the crisis clear, while ensuring that no diplomatic bridges were burned, was\u00a0a\u00a0considerable achievement, although it provoked criticism by many in the US and abroad who wanted a\u00a0harder response. History has proved Bush and Lilley right. China did not, as many feared at the time, turn in on itself and pull back from further change. In 1992, Deng re-energised the programme of economic liberalisation, and set China towards becoming the powerhouse it is today, partly because of the support that Bush and Lilley showed to China. Lilley, described by the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, as &quot;one of our nation&apos;s finest diplomats&quot;, was to spend his final years after retirement in 1991 working for the American Enterprise Institute. He appeared during the inauguration of Ma Ying-Jieo as Taiwanese president in May 2008, but his physical decline was already clear. He is survived by his wife Sally, whom he married in 1954, and two sons. \u2022 James Roderick Lilley, diplomat, born 15 January 1928; died 12 November 2009"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/19/haiti-debts-uk-taiwan-venezuela", "publicationDate": "2010-01-19T18:33:57Z", "tags": ["Haiti", "Debt relief", "Taiwan", "Venezuela", "World news", "Foreign policy", "Politics", "Americas", "Asia Pacific", "Earthquakes"], "sentences": ["Taiwan and Venezuela, Haiti&apos;s main bilateral creditors, are under intensifying pressure to cancel the impoverished Caribbean country&apos;s debts after last week&apos;s catastrophic earthquake.", "Haiti owes $167m (\u00a3102m) to Venezuela and $91m to Taiwan.", "Britain was one of the first members of the Paris Club to cancel all the debts , and it has now urged Venezuela and Taiwan, which are outside the Paris Club, to provide full debt cancellation for Haiti.", "&quot;We are calling on all bilateral creditors of Haiti, especially Taiwan and Venezuela, to urgently provide the debt relief expected under HIPC [the Paris Club&apos;s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative],&quot; Stephen Timms, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said in a letter posted on the Treasury website (pdf).", "Taiwan&apos;s president, Ma Ying-jeou, said Haiti owed its debt to private banks rather than to the government, but he would ask the foreign ministry to consider how it could help.", "France, which chairs the Paris Club, has also called on Taiwan and Venezuela to offer debt relief."], "title": "UK urges Haiti creditors to cancel debts", "article": "Taiwan and Venezuela, Haiti&apos;s main bilateral creditors, are under intensifying pressure to cancel the impoverished Caribbean country&apos;s debts after last week&apos;s catastrophic earthquake.

Haiti was granted $1.2bn in debt relief from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in June last year, in a move the IMF said would free up about $50m a year for spending over the next 10 to 15 years on reducing poverty.

He previously worked as a teacher for Bell Education Trust, International House and Eurocentre The British Council offers a variety of career paths: To start with there are 50 countries where we have teaching centres. As well as teaching, there are a growing number of opportunities in teacher training and management of projects related to the teaching of English. Others move into management of teaching centres and even delivery of UK examinations. A growing number of managers have moved into regional business development or British Council country director roles. Some teachers have specialised in website development. For more information, please contact Teacher Recruitment team. If you want a serious career in TEFL, you need an internationally recognised qualification: The British Council does not accredit qualifications, but for our own purposes we require that our teachers have a qualification, at least at certificate level that is about 100 to 120 hours in length and has six to 10 hours observed and assessed teaching practice. The course must have rigorous quality control too by an independent body like examinations board. If you want more information about courses you can go the British Council website.  Peak recruitment season is from March onwards: The demand for English in increasing all over the world, not least in south east Asia. Teaching opportunities come up throughout the year, although the peak recruitment season is from March onwards, mostly for jobs starting with the September academic year. Susan Griffith, author of Teaching English Abroad, Work Your Way Around the World, Your Gap Year and Gap Years for Grown-ups There&apos;s lots of competition for work in popular cities such as Paris: A tiny fraction of the available vacancies in a city like Paris find their way onto international job sites. There is such a large pool of potential English teachers already resident in the city that it isn&apos;t necessary to trawl further afield. It also means there will be lots of competition for work and it is probably unrealistic to count on having enough work to support yourself within the first couple of weeks. One possibility would be to try to find a work-for-keep arrangement so you wouldn&apos;t empty the coffers paying for accommodation, for example if you were willing to exchange English conversation for a room. This is not uncommon, especially if you are willing to give informal lessons to children and are prepared to be out in the suburbs. But at least this might give you a chance of investigating possibilities on the ground and talking to schools and other teachers.  African countries have many teaching opportunities, but mostly as volunteers: Some sending agencies in the UK charge an arm and a leg to fix up a two or three month placement but there are other ways of doing it. For example, making contact with grassroots NGOs and charities which don&apos;t charge huge placement fees but will still expect volunteers to be self-funding, for example to be able to cover their own expenses. For the most recent edition of my book, Teaching English Abroad, I heard from a man who was travelling in west Africa and taught in countries I had never heard of people doing that before, such as Mauritania and Mali, so it is possible to find paid teaching work. For Sudan, have you looked at the Sudan Volunteer Programme? It is a UK registered charity which promotes English teaching among university students and other adults in and around Khartoum. SVP pays subsistence, accommodation and insurance beyond the initial three months. Volunteers must raise the cost of the airfare to Sudan plus \u00a360 (cost of the first three months insurance). Using a recruiter in your own country can provide some reassurance before travelling: It can be overwhelming when you set out to apply for and then choose a job in an unknown place in China or Japan, for example. Using a recruiter in your own country can provide some reassurance. Recruitment organisations like Saxoncourt Recruitment have been recruiting for Asia for many years and might be worth talking to. Saxoncourt recruit for 250 Shane English Schools in Japan, China, Taiwan and Vietnam. The usual pattern is for the new TEFL teacher to accept a contract with one of the big companies in the first instance and then once they have lived in the country and know the ropes go on to a more independent school with better working conditions. Gain insight into the country and culture you want to teach in by doing CELTA there: Of course lots of TEFL trainees don&apos;t know where they want to teach or will end up teaching. One piece of advice I often give is if someone knows for sure they want to teach in Egypt or Thailand or Turkey or wherever is to do the CELTA (Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults) course in that country. Although the course instructors will have to stick to the syllabus as developed in Cambridge, they may have more understanding of local conditions and there may be some opportunities to do your practice teaching with local students. A university degree is the main requirement for teaching in Korea and Japan: A burning passion for Korean or Japanese culture is not a prerequisite for enjoying a year or two of teaching there. Finding a job in South Korea is easier than in Japan though in both countries the demand for native speaker English teachers is holding up. Few employers insist on a TEFL qualification, though of course a certificate course will provide excellent preparation for facing your first classes. A university degree is the main requirement. My book Teaching English Abroad lists a number of employers including a couple of teacher placement agencies in the UK such as Flying Cows which specialises in Korea. It has masses of specific information. Find as much as you can about a school before signing a contract: In an ideal world you would meet your prospective employer and inspect the school and accommodation if offered before signing a contract. It is always an advantage to meet other teachers and learn about the TEFL scene in that particular place firsthand before committing yourself, rather than accepting a job in complete ignorance of the prevailing conditions. If visiting in person is not feasible, ask the employer for contact details of current or recent teachers to find out the inside story. Ask the employer pertinent questions like what is the staff turnover like. (If a school is constantly advertising for staff, it probably means they aren&apos;t a very good employer.)

Reuters reported that critical articles had appeared in other Chinese media but were removed from websites hours later. The two countries face accumulating disputes over issues ranging from climate change to the Chinese currency \u2013 which the US believes is under-valued \u2013 to how to tackle Iran&apos;s nuclear programme.

For Li, as for remnant Maoists in the 1980s, what used to be called &quot;spiritual pollution&quot; is not only a threat to the facade of puritanical Communist Party rule harking back to the Spartan days in their wartime base (even if it is hugely belied by the extent of corruption by Party officials); it also threatens one of the levers of authority. There is, thus, no way in which China is going to accommodate Google. But, as I suggested in a Cif posting earlier this week, the row has ramifications that reach far beyond this particular case. Clinton&apos;s speech ups the ante considerably. On the day that Obama told the bankers &quot;if these folks want a fight, it&apos;s a fight I&apos;m ready to have&quot;, the secretary of state appears to be sending much the same message to Beijing. If this is the case, it is heartening that somebody as highly placed as Clinton is setting out lines of engagement on the issue of free speech, particularly amid a renewed crackdown on dissidents on the mainland. As I argued in a CiF contribution at the end of last year, the west has not got very far in its dealings with a more assertive, self-confident China, as was evident during Obama&apos;s visit to Shanghai and Beijing in November and at the Copenhagen climate change conference. The Treasury in Washington believed that a softly-softly approach on the currency issue would induce Beijing to raise the value of the yuan, but has achieved nothing at all. There are, of course, very evident difficulties in taking a tougher line. Most other US tech companies operating in China have distanced themselves from Google. The contribution of cheap mainland production to their bottom line in hard times is not something American companies that have set up plants in the People&apos;s Republic want to lose. Nobody has anything to gain from war or a trans-Pacific slanging match that gets out of hand. The G2 concept may be a mirage but China and America have to find ways of working together; one of the big disappointments of the Obama administration to date has been its lack of creativity in seeking to do so. With the US fleet in neighbouring seas, US spy planes patrolling its borders, an edgy relationship with Japan, a potential collapse in North Korea, unrest in Tibet and Xinjiang, the Taliban across the border and the Taiwan issue far from resolved, Beijing has many reasons to feel jittery. A leadership that came to believe Obama had switched to an offensive stance would be even less inclined to compromise with the US than it was in 2009. Mao-era fears of encirclement are never far away. That needs to be taken into account, as does the nature of decision-making in China and the long tradition of rule by law (rather than rule of law), which leads to the automatic conclusion that the likes of Google have to abide by the regulations, whatever they may be, or face the consequences. But the important thing, in this case as in others, is to set out a clear position. Sweet words about shared values have their place. When, as in this case, values are not shared, those who do cannot accept the Chinese leadership&apos;s vision of the nature and flow of information should say so quite clearly \u2013 just as Beijing does on its side."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/26/china-us-talks-human-rights", "publicationDate": "2010-01-26T17:33:14Z", "tags": ["China", "US news", "Human rights", "Censorship", "Internet", "Google", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["That is wildly insufficient.&quot;The People&apos;s Daily warned today that the internet row was harming broader bilateral relations, also strained by trade disputes and US arms sales to Taiwan."], "title": "China and US fail to set timetable for talks on human rights", "article": "China and America&apos;s on-off dialogue on human rights faces postponement again amid discord between the two powers over internet censorship. Talks were meant to take place last year, but a date was never set. The two countries agreed in November, during Barack Obama&apos;s visit to China, that they would resume discussions by the end of February at the latest. This now looks unlikely and it is thought the US is suggesting dates in late March. &quot;We are still continuing to work with the Chinese to schedule,&quot; said a state department official. &quot;Human rights dialogue is a priority for the US.&quot; Although critics complain the dialogue has achieved little, advocates say it is an opportunity to raise important issues and individual cases of concern directly. Some observers believe US officials could be tarrying, fearing that if they do not get a substantive agenda for the talks China could say it is engaging on human rights \u2013 but the US could get little in return. Human rights groups are concerned about last year&apos;s crackdown on lawyers in China, internet censorship, highlighted by the Google case, and the long sentence given to the dissident Liu Xiaobo. Obama is also expected to meet the Dalai Lama soon. Although his predecessors met the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader too, Chinese displeasure could create another obstacle. The last human rights meeting, in May 2008, followed a four-year hiatus. Beijing announced it was suspending participation in 2004 after the US sponsored a resolution at the UN human rights commission condemning China&apos;s record. State department briefing notes say the US declined to schedule another round of talks because there had been no progress on commitments China made in 2002. &quot;The ambassador mentioned it when he first arrived here in August,&quot; said Susan Stevenson, of the US embassy in Beijing, confirming that human rights dialogue was &quot;a priority&quot;. The Chinese foreign ministry says China is willing to continue the human rights dialogue with the US &quot;on the basis of equality and mutual respect&quot;. Last September, asked by the US news broadcaster NPR what America was doing and could do to put pressure on China over human rights issues, the US ambassador, Jon Huntsman, replied: &quot;[Making that dialogue] \u2026 a systemic part of our overall bilateral dialogue is a very important thing to be doing.&quot; But Sophie Richardson, Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, said: &quot;The dialogue has suffered enormously from a lack of clear benchmarks and deliverable human rights goals and has often been hijacked by political considerations. &quot;The only thing that happens if the dialogue goes ahead as it has in the past \u2026 is that the US government has made it incredibly easy for China to check the &apos;human rights&apos; box for the year. That is wildly insufficient.&quot;The People&apos;s Daily warned today that the internet row was harming broader bilateral relations, also strained by trade disputes and US arms sales to Taiwan. But Ma Zhaoxu, spokesman for China&apos;s foreign ministry, said the last year had seen a &quot;hard-won&quot; trend of stable development in relations, thanks to the efforts of both sides. China called off its human rights dialogue with the UK, which was due to take place in Beijing this month, shortly after Britain&apos;s criticism of the execution of Akmal Shaikh, a British drug smuggler said to have had serious mental health problems. It is thought that other issues probably underlay the decision. But Fu Ying, China&apos;s outgoing ambassador to the UK, told Radio 4 today that she did not think there was &quot;any serious damage&quot; to relations following the Shaikh case. &quot;It shows our relationship is strong enough to manage our differences,&quot; she said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/26/turkish-cypriot-separatism-greece-un", "publicationDate": "2010-01-26T19:38:38Z", "tags": ["Cyprus", "Turkey", "Greece", "United Nations", "World news", "Europe"], "sentences": ["One is growing normalisation of relations with other countries, like Taiwan has done."], "title": "Turkish Cypriot appetite for united island dwindles as hostility grows", "article": "Mustafa Iusufoglu was only a small child when Turkish troops overran his village a few miles outside Nicosia in the summer of 1974. But he remembers clearly the elation with which his father and the local Turkish Cypriot community greeted their arrival after years of often bloody, island-wide confrontation with the Greek Cypriot majority. Cyprus has been divided ever since by a UN-monitored ceasefire line \u00adrunning east to west. But that&apos;s for the best, Iusufoglu said. &quot;Before 1974 it was no good. In the village we had two \u00adquarters, one for them, one for us. There was one church and one mosque. There were two separate schools. There was no co-operation, no visiting. There were terrible feuds. It&apos;s better now. &quot;The Greeks don&apos;t like us and we don&apos;t like them. We need to have separate states, though of course it would be good to have a better atmosphere,&quot; he said. Iusufoglu is not alone in his views. Separatist sentiments are gaining ground in Turkish northern Cyprus despite a new round of internationally mediated reunification talks, the \u00adlatest in a series going back more than 40 years. Ever distrustful of Greek intentions, angered by the international trade embargo and other sanctions imposed on their isolated, mostly unrecognised republic, and buoyed by the rise of Turkey as a regional superpower, Turkish Cypriots are tired of waiting for a settlement that never comes. A rising number \u2013 34% in one recent poll \u2013 want to go their own way. Another survey found that 85% of Turkish \u00adCypriots do not believe a reunification solution is possible. There is much scepticism on the Greek Cypriot side, too. &quot;For me personally I think it is better that the two communities are separate,&quot; said Halil, a civil servant in Kyrenia. &quot;We tried. But you saw what happened between 1960 and 1974 [when Greek Cypriots discarded a power-sharing constitution bequeathed by Britain, the former colonial power]. The Greek \u00adCypriots feel the same way.&quot; Suleyman Oral, owner of the Mardin restaurant near Lefke, is more \u00advehement. &quot;The Greek Cypriots are looking at the world with one eye. They don&apos;t understand the realities. The Greeks would like to see all Turkish people go back to Turkey. If Turkey [which has an estimated 30,000 troops in the north] leaves, in a minute they will destroy us. They have tried to do this before.&quot; Businessman Gunay Cherkez, president of the Turkish Cypriot chamber of commerce, said the self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) was viable economically, especially if post-1974 restrictions on direct trade and exports, flights, visas, telecoms and higher education opportunities within the EU were lifted \u2013 although he conceded it would continue to rely on support from Turkey. Like other Turkish Cypriots, Cherkez expressed anger at last week&apos;s court of appeal decision to uphold a ruling ordering a British couple, David and Linda Orams, to demolish a house they built in northern Cyprus on land belonging to a dispossessed Greek Cypriot. He claimed the case demonstrated the insincerity of the Greek Cypriot side in the peace talks, where property rights on both sides of the UN buffer zone are a central issue along with security, territory, and governance. With the current nationalist prime minister, Dervis Eroglu, tipped to replace the TRNC&apos;s pro-reunification president, Mehmet Talat, in elections in April, separatist momentum seems likely to grow. Only an unexpected breakthrough in the latest round of talks, due to concludetomorrow, would significantly change the current dynamic, said Ahmet Sozen of the Cyprus Policy Centre in Famagusta. &quot;Turkey will push the TRNC to stay at the negotiating table&quot; for fear of damaging its bid to join the EU, Sozen said. &quot;But if the Turkish Cypriots are forced to quit, there are other scenarios. One is growing normalisation of relations with other countries, like Taiwan has done. Some countries will start recognising the TRNC, Muslim countries like Syria and Qatar.&quot; Comparisons with Kosovo were also valid, Sozen suggested. In that case, an independent state had been carved out of territory belonging to a sovereign power (Serbia) after a military intervention. A degree of international recognition had then followed. Turkish Cypriot leaders say they are committed for now to the UN-brokered reunification process. But foreign minister Huseyin Ozgurgun said that if the talks failed again, &quot;we will work for recognition&quot; of the TRNC as an independent state. He said his government had increased the number of its representative offices overseas and obtained observer status in the 56-country Organisation of the Islamic Conference. It may open direct air links with Iran next year. Gunay Cherkez summed up Turkish Cypriots&apos; exasperation with what they characterise as endless Greek Cypriot foot-dragging: &quot;I want to dance. I arrange the music. I lower the lights. I&apos;m all dressed up! But my partner doesn&apos;t want to join me. So maybe I dance on my own.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/27/china-company-reward-worker-death", "publicationDate": "2010-01-27T11:10:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Taiwan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["FoxConn, a division of the Taiwan electronics company Hon Hai, has announced a reward of 500,000 yuan (\u00a345,000) for information in the case of Ma Xiangqian who was found dead near the stairway of the dormitory of one of its factories in Shenzhen, southern China, on 23 January.", "A spokesman in the firm&apos;s Taiwan headquarters told the Guardian: &quot;It is a case involving human life, which is of supreme importance, and so what we can do is hand it over to the police and wait for them to finish the investigation."], "title": "Chinese electronics company offers reward after worker's death", "article": "A manufacturer that produces iPhones and Nokia and Motorola handsets is offering tens of thousands of pounds to anyone who can prove foul play in the sudden death of a teenage Chinese worker.

But, as the French president turns 55, his most ardently desired birthday present could come not from a designer \u00adboutique but from within the austere confines of the Palais de Justice. At 10.30 tomorrow morning, in a \u00admagnificent courtroom, France&apos;s most gripping political trial in decades \u2013 the so-called Clearstream affair \u2013 will reach its much-anticipated climax. After three months of court \u00addeliberations, five years of investigation and acres of painstaking press coverage, a Paris judge will rule on an unprecedented legal battle between a head of state, Sarkozy, and a former prime minister, Dominique de Villepin. For the two men, united in \u00adnothing other than mutual loathing and a \u00advisceral lust for power, the stakes could not be much higher. De Villepin, who was appointed prime minister in 2005, stands accused of \u00adcolluding in \u2013 or possibly instigating \u2013 an elaborate smear campaign against his arch rival, Sarkozy, when the pair were locked in a venomous fight to become the next leader of the right after Jacques Chirac. He vigorously denies the charges, insisting he is the victim of the current president&apos;s &quot;furious need&quot; to wipe out a potential nemesis. &quot;Nicolas Sarkozy promised to hang me from a butcher&apos;s hook. I see that the promise has been kept,&quot; he declared during the course of the trial. In private, De Villepin is no less sparing of his 1.65m (5ft 5in) foe. He refers to him as &quot;the dwarf&quot;. The Clearstream affair, which dates back to 2004, centres on a list of names sent anonymously to an investigating judge which appeared to reveal that Sarkozy and others held secret accounts that they used to stash kickbacks from corrupt political deals. The list was swiftly proved to be a forgery, and prosecutors allege that De Villepin and a handful of others were in varying degrees responsible. The blue-blooded former prime minister has declared that he is awaiting the ruling &quot;with the serenity of one who has \u00adnothing with which to reproach himself&quot;. Sarkozy, who last year enraged his critics by referring to the accused as &quot;the guilty ones&quot; on live television, has refused to be drawn into further debate. In an interview, he said simply that he hoped that &quot;the law does its job and says what it sees&quot;. The Clearstream affair has cast a searchlight into some of the murkiest corners of France&apos;s political and business elites. But it is on the two rightwing rivals, whose ambitions could be decisively influenced by the ruling passed down today, that the spotlight has fixed. If De Villepin is convicted of involvement in the smear attempts, he could face up to five years in prison and a bar from political office. Observers say a more realistic penalty would be an 18-month suspended jail sentence and a fine of \u20ac45,000. Any conviction, however partial, could prove problematic for a man who has made it increasingly clear that he has his eyes on the 2012 presidential elections. For Sarkozy, a guilty verdict would mean vindication, a heavy blow dealt to an arch-critic and the best birthday present he could have wished for. But, if the tables are turned, the president&apos;s legal pursuit could blow up in his face. In the event that his enemy is cleared, the notoriously litigious leader risks confirming suspicions that he used his standing to bring about a trial purely in order to satisfy a personal vendetta. Whatever the outcome, the narrative of the case has fixated France. The saga of back-stabbing and skullduggery began five years ago. On the list alongside Sarkozy&apos;s Hungarian family names \u2013 &quot;Nagy&quot; and &quot;Bocsa&quot; \u2013 were those of other politicians and businessmen. All of them were supposedly creaming off kickbacks from the sale of French \u00adfrigates to Taiwan in 1991. Within months, the judge had established the lists were fake. Suspicion soon fell on Jean-Louis Gergorin, a respected former executive at the aviation group Eads, who admitted sending the documents but claimed to have done so at De Villepin&apos;s request. Sarkozy was convinced that he saw evidence of a destabilising plot by the Chirac clan, in which he had been persona non grata since backing Edouard Balladur in the 1995 election, and lodged a formal complaint against those responsible for the forgery. Dozens of other figures who had featured on the faked list also took legal action, and the Clearstream trial eventually opened at the Palais de Justice in September. After weeks of hearings, the \u00adprosecutor, Jean-Claude Marin, argued that it was Gergorin who had instigated the scam for personal reasons and a Lebanese computer specialist, Imad Lahoud, who had falsified the documents at his behest. Gergorin&apos;s lawyer insists his client is innocent and a &quot;ruined&quot; man. Although the forgery had not begun with him, Marin said, De Villepin had made no attempt to stop it once he had realised its potential for damaging Sarkozy. De Villepin continues to refute the allegations and insist he is the \u00advictim of a great injustice. A management consultant and a \u00adjournalist are also in the dock. They deny the charges against them. &apos;Commando-in-chief&apos; Dominique de Villepin \u2013 smooth talker, published poet and sworn enemy of Nicolas Sarkozy \u2013 has strutted back on to France&apos;s political stage in recent months and made it clear he means business. The man Jacques Chirac used to call his &quot;commando-in-chief&quot; has taken steps to resuscitate his career by \u00adpositioning himself as an eloquent critic of a president from whom he \u00addiffers in style and substance. With a flourish of his hallmark rhetoric, which in 2003 earned him thunderous applause at the UN security council for his speech against the invasion of Iraq, he has driven up his public profile through his eponymous Gaullist fanbase, Club Villepin. And, while refusing to openly discuss it, the silver-haired scion of France&apos;s aristocracy has let it be known that he is keen for a chance to oust Sarkozy in the 2012 presidential elections. &quot;For him this is a significant crossroads,&quot; said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dabi, political pollster for Ifop, of the Clearstream verdict. &quot;If he is cleared he will have a new lease of life \u2026 if he is convicted and made ineligible [for political office] it could be catastrophic.&quot; Such stakes are not something the never-elected De Villepin accepts. His insistence on Sarkozy&apos;s vendetta against him is such that, if found guilty, he will endeavour to portray himself as a martyr. &quot;I am the one resisting him [Sarkozy]. The only one, the last one,&quot; he said last year."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/28/apple-ipad-mobile-phones", "publicationDate": "2010-01-28T12:45:49Z", "tags": ["Apple", "Technology", "Technology sector", "Tablet computers", "Computing", "Mobile phones", "Telecommunications industry", "Telecoms", "UK news", "iPad"], "sentences": ["The iPad is also likely to prove a major headache for makers of similar devices, especially Taiwan&apos;s Asus which recently announced plans for its own tablet, and Nokia which last year unveiled a &quot;booklet&quot; computer with built-in 3G."], "title": "Apple iPad: UK phone operators vie for deals", "article": "Steve Jobs has fired the starting pistol in the race to bring the iPad to the UK, with several mobile phone operators and retailer Carphone Warehouse interested in selling Apple&apos;s new tablet computer to consumers this side of the Atlantic. Jobs announced on Wednesday that a version of the device that can access 3G mobile phone networks as well as Wi-Fi will start shipping in the US in April under a deal with AT&amp;T, which already supplies the iPhone in North America. Mobile phone companies in the UK \u2013 O2, Orange, T-Mobile and Vodafone \u2013 are looking to strike similar deals in Europe ahead of a launch later in the year. Orange, owned by France Telecom, has taken an early lead in the race to bring the iPad to the UK and has already held talks with Apple. But it has been in this situation before. It was very close to an exclusive deal with the iPhone but was beaten at the last minute by O2. Vodafone and O2 have yet to begin discussions with Apple, according to sources, but are interested in the iPad. Neither company, however, reckons the iPad will be offered exclusively in the UK. Orange, in contrast, reckons it might be able to get an exclusive deal if it can offer the right sort of subsidy for the phone, which might make it cheaper for British users. However in the US, Appple has shown little interest in getting it&apos;s phone subsidised by it&apos;s wireless partner there, AT&amp;T. Instead it seems to have preferred offering consumers the chance to dip in and out of wireless broadband, rather than being tied to a ling term contract. T-Mobile is understood to be talking to Apple at group level rather than specifically in the UK, meaning it is likely to be trying to put together a deal in more than one European market. Orange is likely to want to clinch a deal for France as well as the UK and T-Mobile in Germany. Vodafone, meanwhile, will also be looking for a deal in Italy, according to sources. Andrew Harrison, UK chief executive of the Carphone Warehouse, welcomed news of the Apple device, adding: &quot;To me, the really interesting thing is what we are seeing is devices designed with how the consumer uses the internet very much in mind, rather than just a computer that was made for business use trying to fit the consumer.&quot; Carphone Warehouse, Europe&apos;s largest independent mobile phone retailer, was Apple&apos;s exclusive third party retail partner for the iPhone and Harrison obviously hopes to repeat the experience with the iPad. &quot;Our perspective is we play in the world of connectivity and particularly mobile connectivity and this device fits well within that; we think there will be a whole range of them. This is an extension of a smartphone perhaps even more than it being a smaller PC. It is much more in the territory that we operate in,&quot; he said &quot;We have done a phenomenal job with the iPhone and smartphones in general and bringing connectivity is something we would be delighted to talk to Apple about.&quot; But the AT&amp;T deal shows that Apple may be approaching the involvement of mobile phone operators with the iPad in a very different way from the way that it uses them for the iPhone. Traditionally, mobile phone companies &quot;subsidise&quot; the up-front cost of hardware \u2013 usually mobile phones, but increasingly laptops \u2013 in return for persuading a customer to sign up to a long-term contract. The operator assumes it will make the subsidy back over the life of the contract. That is how the iPhone is sold in the US and Europe, while even Google followed this model with its Nexus One, signing a deal with T-Mobile in the US which sees the phone&apos;s $529 price tag fall to $179 in return for signing a contract. Vodafone is expected to sell the Nexus One in the UK at roughly the same price point as the iPhone. Already several UK mobile phone companies subsidise the cost of laptops to persuade customers to sign up for long-term mobile broadband contracts. Anyone signing up to a two-year mobile broadband deal with T-Mobile at \u00a340 a month, for instance, gets a free Sony Vaio laptop worth \u00a3499. But with the iPad, Apple has forced AT&amp;T to give up on persuading customers to sign long-term contracts. Instead the iPad will effectively be available on what in Europe would be seen as a 30-day rolling SIM-only contract such as those offered by O2 and Vodafone. Customers have two pricing options in the US, a mere 250MB of data for $14.99 a month, or unlimited data for $29.99 a month. That means that while the basic version of the iPad \u2013 without wireless capabilities \u2013 will start at $499, the 3G version of the device will start at $629. Under the traditional operator model, the 3G version of the device would have been cheaper. &quot;It does not look as though it has the traditional subsidy model,&quot; said Harrison. &quot;If you put Wi-Fi and 3G in it, it is actually more expensive not less expensive.&quot; In a note on AT&amp;T following the news, Jonathan Schildkraut, analyst at Jefferies &amp; Co investment bank said the tariffs are &quot;in line with the current data add-on options available with voice packages, and well below the roughly $60 plans currently offered by wireless carriers for a laptop card. The prepaid plan can be activated directly from the iPad and, because there is no contract, can be canceled at anytime.&quot; &quot;Given the prepaid nature of the service associated with this product, including the no contract/cancel at any time feature, we expect that AT&amp;T would not have to subsidise the device. We would view this as a significant positive \u2013 given the large subsidy associated with the iPhone (estimated at up to $400). Additionally, this would imply better overall economics around the device (without the initial margin dilution of an iPhone sale),&quot; he said &quot;The flip-side, of course, is that the usage patterns of this type of device are unknown. However, given the multimedia capabilities, and the video functionality in particular, we would assume that iPad could be another network hog. This could drive incremental congestion issues on AT&amp;T&apos;s already strained network \u2013 leading to further network dissatisfaction, and potentially a need for ongoing higher levels of capital spending&quot;. In other words, not getting people to sign a contract gives the operator very little chance to factor the potential cost of future infrastructure investment into its pricing plans. Then there is the worry that applications which allow internet telephony \u2013 such as Truphone and Skype, which are already available on the iPhone and will port to the iPad \u2013 will further erode the network&apos;s profitable voice and text traffic. Apple initially sold the iPhone through exclusive partners in the US, UK, France and Germany, but for the iPad the British mobile phone companies are not expecting Apple to offer exclusivity. None of the mobile phone companies was willing to comment on the iPad. Incidentally, anyone who already has a wireless broadband &quot;dongle&quot; under a long-term contract and is thinking about buying an iPad and putting the SIM card from their laptop card into the iPad will be disappointed. The iPad is the first mass-market mobile device to use micro-Sim cards, which are smaller than the current range of Sim cards and were designed for small consumer gadgets such as Birmingham-based Lok8u&apos;s range of wireless-enabled wrist watches. The iPad is also likely to prove a major headache for makers of similar devices, especially Taiwan&apos;s Asus which recently announced plans for its own tablet, and Nokia which last year unveiled a &quot;booklet&quot; computer with built-in 3G.

However, the MacWorld magazine website takes an &quot;educated guess&quot; at UK pricing for the iPad, which it predicts will range from \u00a3388 to \u00a3591 for the Wi-Fi model, and \u00a3490 to \u00a3693 for the Wi-FI and 3G model. The iPad is a 9.7in tablet computer with a virtual keyboard which can surf the web, do email, display ebooks and play video. US prices start at $499 for a basic version with Wi-Fi wireless networking but no 3G connectivity, rising to $829 for a 3G version with 64 gigabytes of storage. However iPad users in the US will have to pay separately for 3G data plans being sold separately by Apple&apos;s exclusive mobile partner there, AT&amp;T, which already supplies the iPhone there. Mobile phone companies in the UK \u2013 O2, Orange, T-Mobile and Vodafone \u2013 are looking to strike similar deals in Europe ahead of a launch later in the year. The Guardian understands from multiple source that no choice has been made. Apple initially sold the iPhone through exclusive partners in the US, UK, France and Germany, but for the iPad the British mobile phone networks are not expecting Apple to offer exclusivity. None was willing to comment on the iPad. Andrew Harrison, UK chief executive of the Carphone Warehouse, Europe&apos;s largest independent mobile phone retailer, commented: &quot;To me, the really interesting thing is what we are seeing is devices designed with how the consumer uses the internet very much in mind, rather than just a computer that was made for business use trying to fit the consumer.&quot; Bloggers and commentators had mixed reactions to the device. It cannot run Adobe&apos;s Flash software, used by many advertisers and games companies online to create eye-catching motion on web pages, which some see as essential to web browsing. Many women were dismayed by the name: the San Francisco Examiner pointed out that &quot;for North American women the word &apos;pad&apos; means but one thing, a sanitary napkin&quot;. But Nick Carr, author of The Big Switch, about the move towards cloud computing, described the launch as &quot;the day the PC died&quot;, saying that Apple &quot;wants to deliver the killer device for the cloud era, a machine that will define computing&apos;s new age in the way that the Windows PC defined the old age.&quot; Without a price ahead of the launch it may be difficult for retailers to judge the public&apos;s interest \u2013 and so whether the device will sell in large or small numbers. Amazon&apos;s Kindle, which includes mobile networking in the price, only launched recently in the UK, and Amazon has never disclosed sales numbers, though it is reckoned to have sold only about 500,000 to the end of last year. The decision to keep the UK price under wraps is unusual for Apple, which usually announces UK pricing simultaneously with any launch, and could either indicate concern about exchange rate fluctuations, or a desire to keep people intrigued about the device, or that non-US networks are seeking to sell it with some sort of subsidy. Already several UK mobile phone companies subsidise the cost of laptops to persuade customers to sign up for long-term mobile broadband contracts. Anyone signing up to a two-year mobile broadband deal with T-Mobile at \u00a340 a month, for instance, gets a free Sony Vaio laptop worth \u00a3499. However, Apple has forced AT&amp;T to give up persuading customers to sign long-term contracts in order to subsidise the iPad; instead, it will effectively be available on what in Europe would be seen as a 30-day rolling Sim-only contract such as those offered by O2 and Vodafone. &quot;It does not look as though it has the traditional subsidy model,&quot; said Harrison. &quot;If you put Wi-Fi and 3G in it, it is actually more expensive not less expensive.&quot; In a note relating AT&amp;T&apos;s financial prospects following the news, Jonathan Schildkraut, analyst at Jefferies &amp; Co investment bank said the tariffs are &quot;in line with the current data add-on options available with voice packages, and well below the roughly $60 plans currently offered by wireless carriers for a laptop card. The prepaid plan can be activated directly from the iPad and, because there is no contract, can be canceled at anytime.&quot; Meanwhile anyone who already has a wireless broadband &quot;dongle&quot; under a long-term contract and is thinking about installing its SIM card into an iPad will be disappointed. The iPad is the first mass-market mobile device to use micro-Sim cards, which are smaller than the current range of Sim cards and were designed for small consumer gadgets such as Birmingham-based Lok8u&apos;s range of wireless-enabled wrist watches. The iPad is also likely to prove a major headache for makers of similar devices, especially Taiwan&apos;s Asus which recently announced plans for its own tablet, and Nokia which last year unveiled a &quot;booklet&quot; computer with built-in 3G. There are also understood to be several tablet computers running Google&apos;s Android software in the works, with France&apos;s Archos rumoured to be planning to release one in March."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/jan/29/ipad-undercuts-taiwans-tablets", "publicationDate": "2010-01-29T14:15:00Z", "tags": ["Apple", "Technology", "Tablet computers", "Computing", "iPad"], "sentences": ["Apple&apos;s iPad prices, which range from $499 to $829, might start too cheap for Taiwan.", "A report today in Taiwan&apos;s DigiTimes, Unexpectedly low Apple iPad price forces notebook vendors to re-evaluate their tablet PC strategies, notes that &quot;starting a price war at below US$499 raises concerns that any profitably will be driven out of the nascent tablet PC market, before it even has a chance to take off.", "Vendors are currently evaluating their strategies hoping to avoid price competition, the sources noted.&quot; Asus had been expected to show its Eee Pad tablet at the Computex 2010 trade show in Taiwan in June.", "Apple uses Taiwanese contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai (Foxconn), which also makes Xbox 360s for Microsoft."], "title": "Apple iPad: too cheap for Taiwan?", "article": "Apple&apos;s iPad prices, which range from $499 to $829, might start too cheap for Taiwan.

Apple uses Taiwanese contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai (Foxconn), which also makes Xbox 360s for Microsoft. Rival contract manufacturers such as Pegatron, which has been spun out of Asus, may not find it easy to undercut its prices, especially if manufacturers include things like USB ports and SD card slots that the iPad lacks. Much of the differential would come out of profit margins. Another problem is that the iPad&apos;s sales volumes are uncertain. Earlier this week, DigiTimes reported that &quot;Positive watchers predict shipments to top as many as 8-9 million units, but those who are less optimistic look to shipments of merely 1-1.2 million units&quot;:  &quot;the skeptics pointed out that sales of the MacBook Air have not measured up to expectations, meaning that not all Apple-branded products can expect guaranteed sales.&quot;  All this leaves sales of me-too tablets even more uncertain, though there might still be worthwhile marketing opportunities in parts of the world that Apple barely reaches."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/30/china-sanctions-taiwan-arms-sales", "publicationDate": "2010-01-30T12:51:26Z", "tags": ["China", "Taiwan", "US news", "Arms trade", "US foreign policy", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The Chinese government has announced retaliatory measures over a planned sale of advanced US weaponry to Taiwan.", "China&apos;s defence ministry said it would suspend military exchanges with the US, impose sanctions on companies selling arms to Taiwan and review wider co-operation on international issues.", "The confrontation over the $6.3bn (\u00a34bn) arms sale to Taiwan \u2013 a self-governing island that Beijing considers part of its sovereign territory \u2013 threatens to strain a relationship already troubled by disputes about internet censorship and trade.", "The official added that relations between the US, China and Taiwan had improved in the past two years under Taiwan&apos;s president, Ma Ying-jeou.", "The sale indicates that Barack Obama will continue the US policy of maintaining the diplomatic status quo between China and Taiwan, while providing the island with weapons to deter Chinese military action.", "&quot;This is a clear demonstration of the commitment that this administration has to provide Taiwan the defensive weapons it needs.", "We think this action contributes to maintaining security and stability across the Taiwan Strait.&quot; The announcement comes in an unusually tense period between China and the US, which maintain close economic links.", "China and Taiwan have had an uneasy relationship since the founding of the People&apos;s Republic of China in 1949.", "Taiwan maintains significant defence capabilities, in large part due to decades of arms purchases from the US.", "The US does not support Taiwanese independence and opposes unilateral action by either side to alter the status quo.", "Taiwan maintains an economic and cultural representative in Washington."], "title": "China retaliates over US arms sales to Taiwan", "article": "The Chinese government has announced retaliatory measures over a planned sale of advanced US weaponry to Taiwan. China&apos;s defence ministry said it would suspend military exchanges with the US, impose sanctions on companies selling arms to Taiwan and review wider co-operation on international issues. The confrontation over the $6.3bn (\u00a34bn) arms sale to Taiwan \u2013 a self-governing island that Beijing considers part of its sovereign territory \u2013 threatens to strain a relationship already troubled by disputes about internet censorship and trade. The planned arms sales, announced by the US military yesterday, could hinder Washington&apos;s efforts to win Chinese support for sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme and exacerbate disputes over the standoff between Beijing and internet giant Google over censorship. The state-run Xinhua news agency cited the defence ministry as saying the suspension was due to the &quot;severe harm&quot; of the arms sales on relations between the US and China. Included in the proposed arms deal are two Osprey mine-hunting ships, 60 Black Hawk helicopters, missiles, machine guns and ammunition, night vision gear, radar equipment and information technology. &quot;This is definitely going to cause considerable tension in the relationship,&quot; a US official who has served in China told the Guardian. The official added that relations between the US, China and Taiwan had improved in the past two years under Taiwan&apos;s president, Ma Ying-jeou. Officially the US downplayed the threat to the bilateral relationship, claiming that the sale would not alter the balance in the region. The sale indicates that Barack Obama will continue the US policy of maintaining the diplomatic status quo between China and Taiwan, while providing the island with weapons to deter Chinese military action. In 2008, for example, the Pentagon announced the sale of $6.4bn in aircraft and missiles. &quot;We have worked through these issues before,&quot; a state department official said. &quot;We will work through them again. &quot;This is a clear demonstration of the commitment that this administration has to provide Taiwan the defensive weapons it needs. We think this action contributes to maintaining security and stability across the Taiwan Strait.&quot; The announcement comes in an unusually tense period between China and the US, which maintain close economic links. Last week the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, called on Beijing to investigate claims by Google of a co-ordinated attack on the email accounts of rights activists that originated in China. She likened Chinese online censorship to the rise of communist Europe, warning that an &quot;information curtain&quot; threatened to descend on the world unless action to protect internet freedom was taken. Beijing called the charges baseless and said Clinton&apos;s remarks hurt the relationship between the two countries. With the miserable state of the US economy contributing to tension with China, America&apos;s largest creditor nation, the US public and members of Congress are becoming restless for action on China&apos;s rights record. China and Taiwan have had an uneasy relationship since the founding of the People&apos;s Republic of China in 1949. Taiwan maintains significant defence capabilities, in large part due to decades of arms purchases from the US. Its primary military mission remains defence against aggression from China, which has not renounced the use of force against to the island. The US recognises Beijing as the sole legal government but maintains significant unofficial links with Taipei. The US does not support Taiwanese independence and opposes unilateral action by either side to alter the status quo. Taiwan maintains an economic and cultural representative in Washington."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/30/china-reaction-us-arms-sale-taiwan", "publicationDate": "2010-01-30T16:03:44Z", "tags": ["China", "US news", "Taiwan", "Arms trade", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["China and the US are set for renewed confrontation after Beijing warned of serious repercussions following Washington&apos;s announcement of a $6.4bn (\u00a34bn) arms deal with Taiwan.", "But, in an indication of US concern about Beijing&apos;s reaction, it does not include F16 fighter jets or a design plan for diesel submarines \u2013 both long sought by Taiwan.", "Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, but Beijing continues to assert sovereignty over it and has said it is prepared to use military action if the island seeks formal independence.", "While the US does not technically have diplomatic relations with Taipei, it is legally obliged to ensure that Taiwan can defend itself and has long supplied it with arms.", "Taiwan&apos;s Defence Ministry said the deal &quot;gives us greater confidence in pushing for an amicable outcome in our relations with China, and will help promote peace in the Taiwan Strait&quot;.", "Taiwan&apos;s relations with the mainland have improved since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008.", "China&apos;s Taiwan affairs office said the deal &quot;fanned the flames of Taiwan independence&quot; and sent the wrong message, according to the Xinhua state news agency."], "title": "China fumes at US arms sale to Taiwan", "article": "China and the US are set for renewed confrontation after Beijing warned of serious repercussions following Washington&apos;s announcement of a $6.4bn (\u00a34bn) arms deal with Taiwan.

The Foreign Ministry statement will add to concerns about the knock-on effects of the deal, and whether it will hinder the prospect of new sanctions against Iran at the United Nations Security Council. Despite China&apos;s reluctance to act against its ally, the US was hopeful that it could win its backing if Russia was on board. Beijing will postpone high-level consultation on strategic security, arms control and non-proliferation issues, it said. The Defence Ministry said it was suspending military exchanges because of the &quot;harm and odious effect&quot; of the deal. The dispute comes amid growing tensions over issues including trade, climate change and internet censorship. &quot;This is the strongest reaction we have seen in recent years,&quot; said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, North East Asia project director of the International Crisis Group. But she added: &quot;Our real sense is that China is looking to see what reaction it will receive from Barack Obama.&quot; US officials made no immediate response to the Chinese reaction, which seemed stronger than expected. The arms deal includes Patriot missiles, Black Hawk helicopters and minehunter ships. But, in an indication of US concern about Beijing&apos;s reaction, it does not include F16 fighter jets or a design plan for diesel submarines \u2013 both long sought by Taiwan. Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, but Beijing continues to assert sovereignty over it and has said it is prepared to use military action if the island seeks formal independence.

China is believed to have more than 1,000 missiles aimed at the island. Taiwan&apos;s relations with the mainland have improved since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008. But Beijing&apos;s reaction to the long-expected sale suggests it may have hoped the thaw would reduce US military cooperation. China&apos;s Taiwan affairs office said the deal &quot;fanned the flames of Taiwan independence&quot; and sent the wrong message, according to the Xinhua state news agency. Washington and Beijing had boasted of a strengthening of bilateral ties, but in recent weeks the relationship has come under growing strain. China is thought to be concerned that Obama faces growing domestic pressure to take a tougher line towards Beijing, and was angered by Hillary Clinton&apos;s speech on internet freedom last week. Although China warned that the speech could damage bilateral relations, both sides subsequently sought to play down the disagreement. Obama&apos;s national security adviser, Jim Jones, said in a speech on Friday that the US was &quot;bent toward a new relationship with China as a rising power in the world&quot;. But Jin Canrong, a professor of international studies at Renmin University, said the arms sale would give Beijing a &quot;fair and proper reason&quot; to accelerate weapons testing."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/31/haiti-disease-epidemics-earthquake", "publicationDate": "2010-01-31T00:05:08Z", "tags": ["Haiti", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news", "Americas", "Earthquakes"], "sentences": ["&quot;They took people&apos;s names, but we haven&apos;t heard anything yet.&quot; Around Luckner&apos;s shelter, a tiny cubicle made out of a black tarpaulin donated by a Buddhist relief group from Taiwan, live some of the people most at risk: mothers and their children, who spend the days playing in the filthy square."], "title": "Haiti doctors fear malaria and typhoid as rainy season arrives", "article": "Aid agencies are warning of an imminent health crisis in Haiti, as the onset of the rainy season brings fears of outbreaks of waterborne diseases in Port-au-Prince&apos;s squalid refugee camps. With up to a million Haitians thought to have lost their homes in the earthquake, and hundreds of thousands still living in 600 squatter settlements around the capital, aid officials warn that the arrival of rain could present them with a further medical crisis after hospitals were initially swamped with patients needing amputations or treatment for crushing injuries. Haiti&apos;s rains normally come in February and the prospect of bad weather has aid workers and homeless people scared. The hurricane season starts in July. &quot;If it rains, there will be a great deal of disease,&quot; said Dr Thierry Causse, a GP from the French Red Cross who is working at a field clinic near the Place St Pierre refugee camp in P\u00e9tionville, where rivers of urine flow through the square. &quot;We are afraid of a typhoid epidemic, of a malaria epidemic. We have a lot of doctors here, but if there is an epidemic there will be a big problem. There could be a lot of dead people if it is not treated quickly and properly.&quot; One of the largest refugee camps is in the city&apos;s football stadium, the Stade Sylvio Cator. On the pitch, thousands of homeless people have made shelters from tarpaulin, corrugated iron and rubble scavenged from fallen buildings. One family is living inside the cramped team dugout where Brazilian football stars such as Ronaldo once sat. &quot;Where I lived is all gone,&quot; said Benita Saint-Cyr, 37, one of three women living in the dugout with dozens of children. &quot;I&apos;m not dead, so all I can do now is pray.&quot; Thervius Luckner, a community leader in the Place St Pierre camp, is also among the city&apos;s displaced population. &quot;It always rains in February,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it is only because of God that it hasn&apos;t rained so far. If it rains, people will be in trouble, the tents are not safe and some people don&apos;t even have tents. I got a message from a Haitian doctor to tell the people not to piss and shit in the camp because the kids will get sick.&quot; The UN and the Haitian government say they are planning to move many of Port-au-Prince&apos;s homeless to camps outside the city, partly to avert risks of a serious epidemic, but in Place St Pierre such promises have yet to materialise. &quot;We had an announcement from the mayor saying they were building houses for people whose homes were destroyed,&quot; said Luckner. &quot;They took people&apos;s names, but we haven&apos;t heard anything yet.&quot; Around Luckner&apos;s shelter, a tiny cubicle made out of a black tarpaulin donated by a Buddhist relief group from Taiwan, live some of the people most at risk: mothers and their children, who spend the days playing in the filthy square. &quot;The doctors haven&apos;t come yet,&quot; said Yolene Philemond, 22, mother of a one-year-old son, when asked if any doctors had visited offering immunisation jabs. &quot;We hope they are coming.&quot; She pointed to a rash on her baby&apos;s arms. &quot;He&apos;s infected. His body is cracked. I don&apos;t know what it is,&quot; said Philemond, whose house was levelled by the quake, killing one of her cousins. &quot;When there is a population displacement and lack of water and sanitation facilities, there is always a risk of diarrhoeal diseases, including cholera,&quot; said Roshan Khadivi of Unicef, adding that water and sanitation diseases were major killers of children under five. On Friday Unicef announced a &quot;major immunisation campaign&quot; for the city&apos;s children, after reports of measles among the young. Khadivi said the campaign against measles, diphtheria and tetanus would begin on Tuesday. But aid agencies fear that unless these refugees are properly and rapidly re-housed in government and UN camps outside the city, waterborne diseases could easily proliferate in the squatter settlements, where the stench of raw sewage hangs in the air. Bo Viktor Nylund, Unicef&apos;s senior child protection officer, said action was needed to move Port-au-Prince&apos;s homeless to more appropriate camps. &quot;These temporary sites cannot go on for long,&quot; he said. &quot;They are sleeping in the street, peeing in the street and shitting in the street. Their parents are sad because they have lost children, friends or family members,&quot; said Pierre Biales, a Paris-based psychologist from the Red Cross, who is offering counselling and trying to teach basic hygiene to children in the camps. &quot;Taking care of the children is now an emergency.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/jan/31/japan-okinawa-islands", "publicationDate": "2010-01-31T00:07:43Z", "tags": ["Japan holidays", "Food and drink", "Adventure travel", "Cultural trips", "Travel"], "sentences": ["The capital Naha, midway down the island chain on the main island, is closer to the tip of the Philippines than it is to Tokyo and on a clear day, from the southernmost island, Yonaguni, it&apos;s possible to see Taiwan, 111km away."], "title": "Long life and happiness in Japan's sunshine isles", "article": "We were halfway to Coconut Moon, a beach bar owned by Kiyomasa Higa, Japan&apos;s godfather of rock, when the taxi radio crackled into action. Coconut Moon was shut, having conceded defeat to Typhoon Lupit. The locals had been praying for rain and they&apos;d got it. Lupit, the first typhoon of the year, arrived in Okinawa about two hours after we did. But while typhoons have scant regard for tourists, our driver had it sussed. &quot;You want awamori [a rice-based spirit]? Dancing?&quot; After three days of lashing rain and cancelled flights and ferries our bedraggled crowd was up for anything. And that&apos;s how we ended up in Nakayuki (Little Break), an inconspicuous bar in the village of Onna, taking turns on a traditional three-stringed guitar, eating dragon fruit, necking guava juice laced with awamori and &quot;pushing the happiness&quot; until 3am. Sharing the love with locals has never been so much fun. Welcome to Japan&apos;s sub-tropical alter ego. An island archipelago flung 1,000km across the Pacific, Okinawa is Japan, but not as we know it. Even the Japanese regard Okinawa as exotically foreign, and until its annexation to mainland Japan as Okinawa Prefecture in 1879, it was exactly that. The Ryukyu Kingdom was for centuries a self-governing tributary state to China, before being invaded by the mainland Satsuma clan at the start of the 17th century. The capital Naha, midway down the island chain on the main island, is closer to the tip of the Philippines than it is to Tokyo and on a clear day, from the southernmost island, Yonaguni, it&apos;s possible to see Taiwan, 111km away. If you&apos;re looking for quintessential Japan you won&apos;t find it here, but Okinawa&apos;s bizarre mish-mash of influences makes an interesting ride. Among its biggest draws are the people. A happy, welcoming if endearingly bonkers lot, the dark-skinned Okinawans are an origin-defying blend of South Pacific-meets-North Asia, with a dash of the Inuit for good measure. The rare fusion of influences also permeates music, culture and dialect. Traditional music in Okinawa has overtones of gamelan from Indonesia. Its stir-fries are comfortingly familiar. Chinese &quot;lucky&quot; cats litter the streets, and Japan&apos;s clean architectural lines are hijacked by curlicued eves that infiltrate the roofs of temples, castles and traditional houses. Where mainland Japan is conservative, Okinawa is carefree and progressive. Tokyo&apos;s &quot;salaryman&quot; suits are replaced by kariyushi wear (the local version of the Hawaiian shirt). These days Okinawa is regarded as a quirky, relatively hip outpost of Japan. Cult-obsessed Japanese teenagers follow its underground music scene, and the annual Peaceful Love Festival draws fans from across Asia. Inspired in part by the popular Japanese soap Churasan, set on one of its sun-drenched islands, six million other Japanese tourists come to fling a Hello Kitty beach towel across one of its hundreds of snow-white beaches, or to snorkel, dive and kayak around coral-fringed islands. A trip to one of these islands (around 50 out of 160 are populated) is rewarded with a rare glimpse into a sunny rural idyll. The shallow channel separating Iriomote and Yufujima is crossed by buffalo cart. Ishigaki and its offshoot islands are home to a rare breed of beef cattle, ranked up there with Kobe. On Kuroshima there are more cows than people. Miyakojima claims to have the best sea salt in the world \u2013 with 18 minerals, it&apos;s listed in the Guinness Book of Records. Whales migrate to the stunning Kerama Islands, 30km west of Naha, while croissant-shaped Minna, looped by snow-white sand, is a two-mile kayak paddle or a 15-minute ferry ride away. Other islands, like far-flung Miyako, explored by 30,000 divers a year, are best reached via a short flight. Okinawan cuisine is among the healthiest in the world, but a shaving of familiar pink stuff may find its way into your stir-fry. US forces, who fought in the Battle of Okinawa of 1945, linger on in controversially spacious bases scattered across the islands and in their sole culinary legacy \u2013 Spam. For all that Okinawa has borrowed from its neighbours, it has given the world a whole lot more \u2013 not least a model for longevity, and one of its most popular forms of martial art. This, after all, is the birthplace of Mr Miyagi, of Karate Kid fame. In Naha I paid a visit to Bunbukan-dojo, one of the numerous dojo (karate gyms) open to tourists. In the front yard I found the pint-sized, grey-bearded sensei Nakamoto Masahiro \u2013 a 10th-level black belt master, author of numerous books and one of the most revered karate sensei in the\u00a0world \u2013 up a ladder, plucking bananas. There is only so much fruit one can consume in the name of politeness \u2013 even in Japan. Five bananas down the line, I was saved by the rain. Mr Nakamoto&apos;s protege ushered me into the drill hall, where he proceeded to demonstrate &quot;the alphabet of karate moves&quot;. My favourite, the knife chop, would go down a treat on the mean streets of Tooting. Now and then Mr Nakamoto would tilt an elbow, or tweak a finger end, but the best was yet to come with the 71-year-old&apos;s demonstration of kobudo, a quick-fire, terrifyingly impressive martial art that uses weapons. In a small, one-room museum above the dojo that he has dedicated to the preservation of kobudo, Mr Nakamoto expounded on the ancient art. During the Ryukyu era, weapons were banned which gave birth to karate, which means &quot;empty hands&quot;. The ancient combative art of kobudo is regarded as the precursor to karate and uses everyday implements such as hoes, oars and the tonfa \u2013 the wooden millstone handle that is the ancestor of the western truncheon. Next time you come under attack on a farm, try the horseshoe technique \u2013 doof, right between the eyes. On second thoughts, maybe not. Martial arts, climate, diet, and spirituality are all thought to contribute towards Okinawa&apos;s freakish longevity statistics. Locals enjoy the highest life expectancy on the planet, and is home to a remarkable number of centenarians. It pays to be adventurous with the area&apos;s largely plant-based diet. Within 48 hours I had eaten pig&apos;s face (it&apos;s everything but the squeak here), had a raw fish blow-torched at my table, wolfed down kilos of silky-smooth tofu (I hate tofu), licked 15 types of salt and grown addicted to a certain salty ice-cream. An ubiquitous purple tuber called imo goes down a treat in doughnut form, but the best place to sample Okinawa&apos;s bitter, bioflavonoid-rich vegetables is at a small restaurant called Emi no Mise in the village of Ogimi, known for obvious reasons as the &quot;centenarian village&quot;. I didn&apos;t question the 15-dish seasonal longevity menu. I just ate it: pond herring stewed with salt, seaweed tofu (reddish seaweed, carrot and skin of pig&apos;s face), handama (a slimy, iron-packed green-and-purple vegetable) and chilled shikuwasa noodle, made with stringy, crunchy seaweed, aloe vera and the juice of shikuwasa (a sort of citrus fruit). Washed down with locally grown hibiscus tea, it was not bad for a tenner.

The US is dispatching Patriot defensive missiles to four countries \u2013 Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait \u2013 and keeping two ships in the Gulf capable of shooting down Iranian missiles. Washington is also helping Saudi Arabia develop a force to protect its oil installations. American officials said the move is aimed at deterring an attack by Iran and reassuring Gulf states fearful that Tehran might react to sanctions by striking at US allies in the region. Washington is also seeking to discourage Israel from a strike against Iran by demonstrating that the US is prepared to contain any threat. The deployment comes after Obama&apos;s attempts to emphasise diplomacy over confrontation in dealing with Iran \u2013 a contrast to the Bush administration&apos;s approach \u2013 have failed to persuade Tehran to open its nuclear installations to international controls. The White House is now trying to engineer agreement for sanctions focused on Iran&apos;s Revolutionary Guard, believed to be in charge of the atomic programme. Washington has not formally announced the deployment of the Patriots and other anti-missile systems, but by leaking it to American newspapers the administration is evidently seeking to alert Tehran to a hardening of its position. The administration is deploying two Patriot batteries, capable of shooting down incoming missiles, in each of the four Gulf countries. Kuwait already has an older version of the missile, deployed after Iraq&apos;s invasion. Saudi Arabia has long had the missiles, as has Israel. An unnamed senior administration official told the New York Times: &quot;Our first goal is to deter the Iranians. A second is to reassure the Arab states, so they don&apos;t feel they have to go nuclear themselves. But there is certainly an element of calming the Israelis as well.&quot; The chief of the US central command, General David Petraeus, said in a speech 10 days ago that countries in the region are concerned about Tehran&apos;s military ambitions and the prospect of it becoming a dominant power in the Gulf: &quot;Iran is clearly seen as a very serious threat by those on the other side of the Gulf front.&quot; Petraeus said the US is keeping cruisers equipped with advanced anti-missile systems in the Gulf at all times to act as a buffer between Iran and the Gulf states. Washington is also concerned at the threat of action by Israel, which is predicting that Iran will be able to build a nuclear missile within a year, a much faster timetable than assessed by the US, and is warning that it will not let Tehran come close to completion if diplomacy fails. The director of the CIA, Leon Panetta, met the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and other senior officials in Jerusalem last week to discuss Iran. Pro-Israel lobby groups in the US have joined Republican party leaders in trying to build public pressure on the administration to take a tougher line with Iran. One group, the Israel Project, has been running a TV campaign warning that Iran might supply nuclear weapons to terrorists. &quot;Imagine Washington DC under missile attack from nearby Baltimore,&quot; it says. &quot;A nuclear Iran is a threat to peace, emboldens extremists, and could give nuclear materials to terrorists with the ability to strike anywhere.&quot; Washington is also concerned that if Iran is able to build nuclear weapons, other states in the region will feel the need to follow. Israel is the only country in the Middle East to already have atomic bombs, although it does not officially acknowledge it. The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, said in London last week that the US will press for additional sanctions against Iran if it fails to curb its nuclear programme. Europe&apos;s foreign affairs minister, Catherine Ashton, today said the UN security council should now take up the issue. &quot;We are worried about what&apos;s happening in Iran. I&apos;m disappointed at the failure of Iran to accept the dialogue and we now need to look again at what needs to happen there,&quot; she told Sky News. &quot;The next step for us is to take our discussions into the security council. When I was meeting with Hillary Clinton last week we talked about Iran and we were very clear this is a problem we will have to deal with.&quot; However, China and Russia are still pressing for a diplomatic solution. Tony Blair, Middle East envoy on behalf of the US, Russia, the UN and the EU, continually referred to what he described as the Iranian threat during his evidence at the Chilcot inquiry last Friday. Textual analysis now shows that he mentioned Iran 58 times. Besides the new missile deployment, Washington is also helping Saudi Arabia to create a 30,000-strong force to protect oil installations and other infrastructure, as well as expanded joint exercises between the US and military forces in the region. The move is a continuation of the military build-up begun under former president George W Bush. In the past two years, Abu Dhabi has bought $17bn (\u00a311bn) worth of weapons from the US, including the Patriot anti-missile batteries and an advanced anti-missile system. UAE recently bought 80 US-made fighter jets. It is also buying fighters from France. Petraeus said in a speech in Bahrain last year the UAE air force &quot;could take out the entire Iranian air force, I believe&quot;. Missile defence Patriot missiles are designed to intercept enemy missiles before they reach their target. Since production began in 1980, 9,000 missiles have been delivered to countries including Germany, Greece, Taiwan and Japan. During the first Gulf war Patriot success was 70% in Saudi Arabia and 40% in Israel. Since then the US has spent more than $10bn (\u00a36.3bn) improving, among other aspects, the system&apos;s radar and computer compatibility for joint forces action. Once in position, the system requires a crew of only three people to operate. Each missile weighs 700kg and has a range of about 100 miles. The US navy is in the process of upgrading all its Ticonderoga class cruisers and a number of destroyers to carry the Aegis ballistic missile defence system. It uses a surface-to-air missile that is capable of intercepting ballistic missiles above the atmosphere. It has also been tested on failing satellites as they fall to earth. Each missile is over 6m long and costs more than $9m.

Beijing&apos;s reaction to the package \u2013 which includes Black Hawk helicopters, Patriot missiles and mine-hunter ships \u2013 was described by one official newspaper as its toughest in three decades of sales. It comes as the bilateral relationship faces other strains over issues including climate change, Tibet, censorship and trade. A commentary in the official Communist party newspaper the People&apos;s Daily accused Washington of &quot;rude and unreasonable cold war thinking&quot;. &quot;The United States is still drawing lines based on ideology and coming up with a million ways to stymie China&apos;s development and progress,&quot; the paper&apos;s overseas edition said. China Daily, an official English language paper, said in an editorial: &quot;China&apos;s response, no matter how vehement, is justified. No country worthy of respect can sit idle while its national security is endangered and core interests damaged.&quot; Taiwan has been under self-rule since the end of the civil war in 1949. But Beijing still asserts sovereignty over the island and has said it is willing to use military force if Taipei seeks formal independence. Although the US switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, Congress passed a law in the same year obliging the US government to help Taiwan defend itself. The latest deal does not include some weapons that Taipei has long sought, such as F16 fighter jets. Cross-straits relations have improved markedly since Ma Ying-jeou became president of Taipei in 2008 and so far Beijing has focused its ire on the US. China has threatened to impose &quot;corresponding sanctions&quot; on American companies involved in the deal despite its long-standing reluctance to use such measures in international disputes. Such a move might affect companies like Boeing, but US firms do not sell arms to Beijing. Washington could take a case to the World Trade Organisation if China sought to restrict imports of other goods. The greatest concern for the US may be the Chinese foreign ministry&apos;s warning that co-operation on international and regional issues &quot;will inevitably be affected&quot;. Many analysts have taken that as a warning that China will push back against new sanctions on its ally Iran, which it was already reluctant to support, and will be less co-operative over tackling North Korea. The ministry has already cancelled talks between senior Chinese and US officials on strategic security, arms control and nuclear non-proliferation. &quot;The greatest casualty of a downturn in US-China relations would be international peace and security, especially if it negatively affects co-operation within the United Nations. This is in the interests of neither the US nor China,&quot; said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, the north-east Asia project director of the International Crisis Group. China&apos;s reaction appears to be an attempt to head off what it sees as a tougher approach by the US, as well as a reflection of its increased self-confidence. The deal comes shortly after Hillary Clinton criticised China&apos;s internet censorship \u2013 a noticeable change in tone from earlier comments on human rights \u2013 and just before Barack Obama&apos;s expected meeting with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. &quot;So shortly after [Obama] came to China and made his joint statement [with president Hu Jintao], he turned his face,&quot; said Shi Yinhong, director of the centre for American studies at Renmin University. &quot;It is so easy to sacrifice the relationship with China because of concerns about the domestic situation. That is not statesmanlike.&quot; He said that so far Beijing had mixed hard words with limited actions. But he added: &quot;China has of course much more self-confidence. I think some Europeans and Americans have not adapted to change and see China as small and weak ... It&apos;s a huge, independent country and doesn&apos;t want to be dictated to by anyone.&quot; Professor Jin Canrong, professor of international studies at Renmin University, said: &quot;After the financial crisis China&apos;s international standing has been promoted ... It holds more cards to deal with the US.&quot; Jin acknowledged that some in the US felt &quot;anger or disappointment&quot; towards China. But he added: &quot;People in China think it has tried to co-operate with the US but has its own interests and principles and opinions on issues. If the US decides to build unrealistic expectations that&apos;s not the fault of China.&quot; Wallace Gregson, the US assistant secretary of defence for the Asia-Pacific region, said Washington aimed to maintain good relations with China but would not abandon Taiwan. &quot;The United States fully intends to meet every one of our obligations [regarding Taiwan&apos;s self-defence] and we will continue to do so into the future,&quot; he said at a meeting in Tokyo.

But one fact stands out plainly: in layman&apos;s terms, America is broke. The federal government&apos;s outgoings will exceed income by about $1.6tn this year; over the next 10 years combined, the predicted gap is $8.5tn. Given the partisan impasse on Capitol Hill over spending cuts and higher taxes, there is no reason to assume matters will improve any time soon. Obama suggested this week that such mind-boggling improvidence is unsustainable, economically and even morally. But continuing, chronic American financial vulnerability also carries increasingly serious implications for US global influence and its standing as the world&apos;s only superpower. In short, the deficit, and the mindset that produces it, begin to threaten the post-1945 security architecture. The western world has been here before. In Asia, Africa, and the Middle East after the second world war, the US extended its geopolitical pre-eminence and market dominance, filling a vacuum where the exhausted British and European empires once held sway. Facing serious competition only from the Soviet Union, America supplanted the &quot;old world&quot; and took control. The end of the cold war entrenched its global grip. Now the wheel turns \u2013 and it is the US that is coming down with a bump. In prospect is America&apos;s &quot;east of Suez&quot; moment, when imperial Britain was forced to recognise it could no longer afford to project its power into every corner of the globe. Washington&apos;s still pre-eminent military might is increasingly unmatched and undermined by its economic performance and, arguably, by its political leadership. As Obama noted in his West Point speech on Afghanistan, the US can no longer finance open-ended wars. The end of the American empire has long been foretold. But it&apos;s not hubris or hostile action that brings it low. It&apos;s a lack of readies, meaning unpaid, high-interest, foreign-owned debt, and an unaffordable lifestyle. And unlike the postwar period, when a Europe with common interests, a broadly similar political outlook, and shared values passed the security baton to the US, America has no like-minded, amicable successor to turn to as its own power fades. Quite the opposite, in fact. China, the country most likely to replace the US some time this century as the world&apos;s top dog, has sent blunt signals in recent months indicating how very different a post-American world will look. At Copenhagen, by many accounts, it played spoiler against the developed world, deliberately humbling Obama. It made political advantage, not climate change, the most pressing issue. Beijing&apos;s deliberately disproportionate reaction to the latest US arms sale to isolated Taiwan, its noisy objections to any meeting between Obama and the Dalai Lama, and its blatant use of internet censorship and broad disregard for international human rights norms highlight disturbing differences in priorities and attitudes. China&apos;s rapid military buildup, its appeasement of Iran&apos;s energy-rich, nuclear-suspect regime, its exploitative development and resource policies in Africa, and its unfair trading and currency practices are strategically more destabilising. All this suggests a government ruthlessly on the make, determined to exploit perceived weakness in Washington and increasingly prepared to act in direct opposition to western security and political interests. Accumulated US public debt of $7.5tn, much of it held by China, was heightening American vulnerability in the face of such challenges, said Wall Street Journal columnist Gerald Seib. &quot;The US government this year will borrow one of every three dollars it spends, with many of those funds coming from foreign countries,&quot; he wrote this week. &quot;That weakens America&apos;s standing and its freedom to act; strengthens China and other world powers, including cash-rich oil producers; puts long-term defence spending at risk; undermines the American system as a model for developing countries; and reduces the aura of power that has been a great intangible asset for presidents for more than a century.&quot; Obama isn&apos;t cutting defence, not yet at any rate. And some argue that a world not girdled by American military bases, embassies and trade missions would be a better place. But it might not be a safer one. It would almost certainly be less compatible with western democratic standards and value systems. These are powerful reasons to invert former British prime minister George Canning&apos;s famous 1826 call to bring &quot;the new world into existence to redress the balance of the old&quot;. On present trends, Obama&apos;s America badly needs the allies of &quot;old world&quot; Europe to help redress its loss of balance and stem the haemorrhaging of its international clout. With wolves at the door, the transatlantic relationship, often dismissed as moribund and unimportant under George Bush and Obama, may be coming back into its own. Obama does not seem to realise this yet, with the state department announcing this week, for example, that the president will not attend a US-EU summit in Spain in May. Give him time. As the bills pile up and threat levels rise, America may remember who its real friends are."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/feb/03/francis-blanchard-obituary", "publicationDate": "2010-02-03T18:10:59Z", "tags": ["Politics", "World news"], "sentences": ["In this period the US left the organisation and then came back, Taiwan left and China joined after a long hesitation, the &quot;basic needs&quot; development concept was launched, and ideological battles ran high.", "The UN general assembly decided in 1971 to withdraw Taiwan&apos;s seat and give it to mainland China."], "title": "Francis Blanchard obituary", "article": "Francis Blanchard, who has died aged 93, was director-general of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in interesting times, from 1974 to 1989. In this period the US left the organisation and then came back, Taiwan left and China joined after a long hesitation, the &quot;basic needs&quot; development concept was launched, and ideological battles ran high. However, life had made Blanchard a man who could handle delicate situations. Born in Paris, he studied at the Sorbonne, did his military service in the air force from 1937 to 1940, and survived his airfield being bombed by the Germans. He spent several years during the second world war at Vichy, working as an assistant to Lucien Romier, a former director of Le Figaro, who was appointed minister of state by Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, leader of the collaborationist government. Blanchard later told me that he was involved in resistance activities while at Vichy. By October 1944, he was in Paris at the ministry of the interior, working in a\u00a0unit that dealt with refugees, displaced persons and prisoners. He was part of the team negotiating with Soviet officials over the return of thousands of\u00a0Soviet soldiers. This delicate balancing act suggested he was the right person to participate in the creation of\u00a0the International Refugee Organisation in\u00a0Geneva, where he worked from 1947 until 1951. David Morse, the long-serving director-general of the ILO (1948-70), asked Blanchard to join this UN agency in 1951, starting a 38-year career there. He became assistant director-general in 1956 and deputy director-general in 1968. The following year, which marked the ILO&apos;s 50th anniversary, brought significant success for the organisation. It was awarded the Nobel peace prize; Pope Paul VI addressed the International Labour Conference (&quot;development is\u00a0the new dimension of\u00a0peace&quot;); and\u00a0Morse launched the World Employment Programme. Morse left in May 1970, and in the election that followed, Blanchard was defeated for the post of director-general by Wilfred Jenks, a British lawyer who won by only two votes. Jenks died in October 1973 and Blanchard became his successor in March 1974. In the meantime, difficulties had accumulated and Blanchard entered a minefield. Jenks had appointed a\u00a0Soviet official as assistant director-general immediately after his election, to the fury of an influential delegate, George Meany, the boss of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of\u00a0Industrial Organisations. Soon after, the US stopped paying its financial contribution and threatened to leave the organisation. The UN general assembly decided in 1971 to withdraw Taiwan&apos;s seat and give it to mainland China. But China was hesitant about entering the ILO. With the US threatening to withdraw, and China hesitant, the universality of the organisation was in danger. The ideological battles thus let loose, on top of the Palestine question, threatened the ILO&apos;s very existence. There were also heated discussions, across the entire UN structure of organisations, about international income redistribution, prompted by President Houari Boumedienne of Algeria&apos;s New International Economic Order proposals in 1973. The ILO is a tripartite organisation \u2013 governments, employers and trade unions \u2013 and most of these members wanted it to concentrate on labour market questions and the international labour code. To his credit, Blanchard pushed the organisation to work in the more general field of social progress through economic development. In line with this priority, in 1976 he launched the World Employment Conference, which introduced a development strategy designed to fulfil the basic needs of the entire population over the next 25 years, in terms of food, shelter, education and health, by a combination of economic growth and income distribution. This was a courageous initiative on Blanchard&apos;s part because income distribution was (and still is) a\u00a0red flag for the Americans. I was director of the ILO World Employment Programme in those days, and remember Blanchard as nervous but steady. The US administration under President Jimmy Carter embraced the concept of basic human needs in January 1977, but then decided to leave the organisation some 10 months later. The reason was that Meany resented the fact that the Soviet Union, according to him, had nine votes in the ILO (three countries with three representatives each). When Meany died in 1980, the US rejoined the organisation and in 1983 China finally decided to join. Patient diplomacy was rewarded, universality was restored and\u00a0Blanchard was secure. During the 1980s, Blanchard played an important role in getting Lech Walesa and his Polish Solidarity trade union recognised internationally. He also tried to change the absurd structural adjustment policies of the international financial institutions by organising a\u00a0high-level conference in 1987, but the US and the UK refused to be represented at the appropriate level and no follow-up came about. Months before the Berlin wall came down, Blanchard left the ILO. In\u00a0retrospect, he was proud of his efforts in Poland in the 1980s and his contribution to social development and\u00a0employment in the developing world in the 1970s. But what many of\u00a0us who knew him remember most is his good heart, reflected in his help to trade unionists in mortal danger and political refugees from behind the iron curtain who needed assistance. Blanchard made a last public appearance at the 90th anniversary of the ILO in June 2009. He was predeceased by his wife, Marie-Claire, and a son. Another son survives him. \u2022 Francis Blanchard, international labour administrator, born 21\u00a0July 1916; died 9\u00a0December 2009"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/04/barack-obama-china-yuan", "publicationDate": "2010-02-04T12:45:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Barack Obama", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["&quot;Criticism and pressing obviously is not helpful to solving problems.&quot; The comments come at a tense time in relations between the countries, with diplomatic concerns over issues including US arms sales to Taiwan, Obama&apos;s possible meeting with the Dalai Lama and China&apos;s alleged cyberattack on Google."], "title": "China hits back at Barack Obama's claims that yuan is undervalued", "article": "China today disputed Barack Obama&apos;s suggestion that it was artificially depressing its currency to gain a trade advantage.

Beijing claims Tibet is part of China, views the Dalai Lama as a troublemaker and has lobbied firmly against the visit. Although other US presidents have met the Dalai Lama, China had hoped that Obama might adopt a different approach, given the enthusiasm with which he wooed Beijing last year. The controversial visit comes on top of a series of rows over the last few weeks in which relations between the US and China have taken a turn for the worse. Obama told US legislators on Wednesday that he will take a tougher line towards China over its huge US trade surplus. Other grievances include US plans to sell arms to Taiwan, the row with the leading search engine Google over alleged cyber attacks, and US disappointment at China&apos;s failure to support it over climate change at Copenhagen and on sanctions against Iran. China specialists in Washington said today that the Obama administration had always planned the Dalai Lama meeting and the arms sales to Taiwan, but had simply deferred them while it established a rapport with Beijing. But there had been a sudden coming together of issues over the last month. These have created &quot;a perfect storm and the question now is how to navigate out of it,&quot; said Evan Feigenbaum, a China specialist at Washington&apos;s Council on Foreign Relations and a former deputy assistant secretary of state for South Asia. &quot;I think it is going to be a rocky year.&quot; What has made US-Chinese relations even more volatile is that they have become part of American domestic politics, in particular public resentment over job losses. Obama, speaking to Democratic legislators in Washington on Wednesday, urged China to open its markets more to US goods. &quot;The approach that we are taking is to try to get much tougher about enforcement of existing rules,&quot; he said. He added that the China had to address currency rates to ensure that the price of US goods was not artificially inflated while imports were artificially deflated. An even playing field, he said, could help double US exports and create US jobs. &quot;If we just increased our exports to Asia by a percentage point, by a fraction, it would mean hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of jobs here in the United States,&quot; Obama told the senators. China, responding to Obama , said it will not submit to US pressure to revalue its currency. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Ma Zhaoxu, said the Chinese currency is not the main reason for China&apos;s trade surplus with the US: &quot;Accusations and pressure do not help.&quot; China also showed no signtoday either of backing down over Iranian sanctions. The Chinese foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, on a visit to Paris, rejected calls by the US, Britain and others to back UN security council sanctions. &quot;To talk about sanctions against Iran at present was counterproductive,&quot; he said. The US continued to ramp up pressure today. The US deputy assistant secretary of state, David Shear, told a Congressional panel that Beijing would regret any action to punish US businesses involved in the planned $6.4bn (\u00a34bn) arms sales to Taiwan. He said the US was &quot;greatly concerned&quot; at the prospect of retaliatory action by China. A common theme among Chinese specialists in the US is that the breach is because China has become overconfident about its rising world power status and has been over-reaching itself. Shear said that rising Chinese confidence was prompting Beijing to assert its interests in Asia more forcefully, but the US was making sure China understood the US too had interests in the region. Bonnie Glaser, a China specialist at Washington&apos;s Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said: &quot;We are going to have a rough patch. No doubt about it. Issues that have been on the backburner are coming to the fore.&quot; She saw the rows as part of a rebalancing of expectations. &quot;The US may have had a high expectation for China and the Chinese may have had too high expectations of the Obama administration. I think both want to remain on even keel. The Chinese would be worried if it went to a downward spiral. And so would we.&quot; Professor Susan Shirk, Bill Clinton&apos;s deputy assistant secretary of state with responsibility for China, and now at the University of California, said she did not see a change from Obama&apos;s side. &quot;What I do see is some change on the Chinese side that I believe is due to a rather unfortunate combination of international overconfidence and domestic insecurity.&quot; Feigenbaum said that, in spite of Obama&apos;s efforts in the first year to build confidence, &quot;there is an enduring lack of trust and confidence on both sides&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/05/taiwanese-military-orders-german-helicopters", "publicationDate": "2010-02-05T10:08:03Z", "tags": ["Taiwan", "China", "Germany", "EADS", "World news", "Business", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s military will buy up to 20 helicopters from a German manufacturer, it was confirmed today, days after Beijing lashed out at a multibillion-dollar US arms deal with the island.", "China has yet to respond to news of the agreement, thought to be the first European sale to Taiwan&apos;s armed forces since the early 90s.", "Taiwan&apos;s defence ministry spokesman Martin Yu said the island would buy EC-225 search-and-rescue helicopters.", "The Taiwanese defence ministry said it was not an arms order and the EC-225 is a civilian model.", "But the Taiwanese armed forces have bought non-military helicopters in the past and customised them with equipment suited to military models.", "&quot;I would be surprised if China makes a big fuss and if Eurocopter had not considered China&apos;s interests in its sales to Taiwan,&quot; he added, pointing out that the mainland was a much bigger client.", "Calls to the Taiwan Affairs Office rang unanswered.", "It warned of plans to impose sanctions on US firms that sell weapons to Taiwan and said it was &quot;unavoidable&quot; that co-operation on wider issues would be affected."], "title": "Taiwanese military orders German helicopters", "article": "Taiwan&apos;s military will buy up to 20 helicopters from a German manufacturer, it was confirmed today, days after Beijing lashed out at a multibillion-dollar US arms deal with the island. China has yet to respond to news of the agreement, thought to be the first European sale to Taiwan&apos;s armed forces since the early 90s. Taiwan&apos;s defence ministry spokesman Martin Yu said the island would buy EC-225 search-and-rescue helicopters. The $111m contract with Eurocopter, a subsidiary of EADS, is for three helicopters, with an option to buy up to 17 more. The move could fray Sino-European ties, already under strain over trade and currency issues. Yesterday China filed a complaint to the World Trade Organisation over the EU&apos;s anti-dumping tariffs on shoes. The arms deal could also affect Beijing&apos;s relations with Taipei, which have improved markedly since President Ma Ying-jeou took office on a platform of improving ties two years ago. However, others believe that China could remain silent or issue only a muted response if it is satisfied that the helicopters are not for military tasks. &quot;If it&apos;s for a pure civic purpose that would be no problem, but if it belongs to the defence ministry then I think it could be,&quot; said Jin Canrong, professor of international studies at Renmin University. The Taiwanese defence ministry said it was not an arms order and the EC-225 is a civilian model. But the Taiwanese armed forces have bought non-military helicopters in the past and customised them with equipment suited to military models. Jing Huang, an expert on Asian security and visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, said China&apos;s response was likely to depend on the exact nature of the order. &quot;I would be surprised if China makes a big fuss and if Eurocopter had not considered China&apos;s interests in its sales to Taiwan,&quot; he added, pointing out that the mainland was a much bigger client. &quot;China may think it&apos;s better not to fight on two fronts [given its anger at the US deal]. It&apos;s also talking with \u00adEuropeans about lifting the arms embargo. So I\u00a0believe it will be more constrained; it doesn&apos;t make sense to make a fuss before the deal is even finalised.&quot; Defense News, which first reported the sale, said the contract would be signed within a few days. China&apos;s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to questions on the helicopter sale. Calls to the Taiwan Affairs Office rang unanswered. China hit back unusually hard following last week&apos;s announcement of the US&apos;s $6.4bn arms package, which includes Patriot missiles, naval minesweepers and Black Hawk helicopters. It warned of plans to impose sanctions on US firms that sell weapons to Taiwan and said it was &quot;unavoidable&quot; that co-operation on wider issues would be affected."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/05/china-taiwan-iran-arms-us", "publicationDate": "2010-02-06T01:28:00Z", "tags": ["Iran", "Nuclear weapons", "World news"], "sentences": ["He also criticised the US for its decision a week ago to sell more than $6bn in arms to Taiwan, which he said represented a violation of earlier bilateral agreements and &quot;the international code of conduct&quot;."], "title": "Iran says 'final; deal on uranium exchange is near", "article": "Iran&apos;s foreign minister claimed last night that his country was &quot;approaching a final agreement&quot; on a uranium exchange proposal, but hinted at conditions that may make it unacceptable to the west. Manouchehr Mottaki was talking about a deal made in principle last October to swap most of Iran&apos;s enriched uranium stockpile for fuel rods. The agreement appeared to unravel at the end of last year, amid bitter disagreements in Tehran. Speaking at a security conference in Munich last night, however, Mottaki said: &quot;I personally believe we have created \u00adconducive ground for such an exchange in the not very distant future.&quot; But he added that Iran should set the amount of uranium that would be exchanged, suggesting that less than the 1,200kg of low enriched uranium (LEU) provisionally agreed last year would be exported. &quot;Our request is the quantity should be announced by the party who is going to use this enriched uranium, and the quantity will be announced based on our need, this is the most important point,&quot; the \u00adforeign minister said. Such a change could render any deal worthless in the eyes of western governments, for whom the whole point of the bargain was to deplete Iran&apos;s stockpile, which they feared could be further refined to highly enriched uranium (HEU) to make a nuclear bomb. Mottaki said he would discuss Iran&apos;s proposal at the weekend with the new head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Yukiya Amano, who is also attending the Munich security conference. The foreign minister&apos;s remarks last night came a few days after an interview given by Iran&apos;s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who raised the possibility of Iranian low enriched uranium being exported and returned within five months in the form of fuel rods. The president did not mention how much might be exported, and his offer was met with scepticism from western capitals, where his remarks were seen as a gambit to buy time and forestall sanctions. Preliminary discussions have begun at the UN in New York on a further round of punitive measures aimed at Iranian individuals and institutions linked to the nuclear and missile programmes, and the revolutionary guards who control both. However, a security council resolution is seen as highly unlikely in the near future because of Chinese opposition. Speaking at the same conference in Munich, China&apos;s foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, made clear that China was prepared to stand alone among the permanent members of the security council in opposing sanctions . He insisted Iran had not closed the door on negotiations over the export of its uranium, and called for patience and &quot;a more flexible, pragmatic and proactive policy&quot; towards talks with Tehran. In his remarks Yang said it was time for China&apos;s voice to be listened to with more respect on the world stage. &quot;We have one fifth of mankind,&quot; the foreign minister said. &quot;At least we deserve a chance to express our views on how things should be run in the world. &quot;We are offering views but we have the modesty to listen to others. That has always been the tradition of China, but I think, we also deserve a hearing of one kind or another. One country, two countries three or four countries can definitely not decide the future of the world.&quot; Yang rejected western criticism on internet freedoms and China&apos;s role at the Copenhagen global warming summit in December. He also criticised the US for its decision a week ago to sell more than $6bn in arms to Taiwan, which he said represented a violation of earlier bilateral agreements and &quot;the international code of conduct&quot;. &quot;The Chinese government and people feel indignant about this,&quot; Yang said. &quot;We approached the US side very seriously on many occasions. Yet the US went ahead and forced the Chinese government and people to react. We think it is our sovereign right to do what is necessary.&quot; The remarks appeared to refer to \u00adpossible retaliatory action against US \u00adcompanies.

The relationship was already effective and smooth on trade, Taiwan and global warning. With two firm multilateralists, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, now in power, it would be positively strengthened and constructive, the official mouthpiece opined. How different the picture looks today \u2013 and how wounded the official tone. China sent a deputy foreign minister to negotiate with Mr Obama in Copenhagen, scuppering the deal that not just the US but many other countries wanted. Next came the cyber-attacks on Google. Then the White House approved a decision to sell patriot missiles to Taiwan, announced that Mr Obama would meet the Dalai Lama and lectured China on its overvalued currency. Forget the metaphor of resetting relations, which the US used recently with Russia. Hardly a month goes by when the US and China can resist pushing each other&apos;s buttons. Is China&apos;s assertiveness and Mr Obama&apos;s hardened attitude all down to economics \u2013 to the former&apos;s impressive performance during the global recession and the latter&apos;s much weaker one? Economists reckon the Chinese currency, which has remained at the same value since July 2008, is undervalued by 25% to 40%. Even on the lower figure, the effect of a correction on the currencies of neighbours like Malaysia, \u00adSingapore, and Taiwan would be major and would collectively help cut the US deficit by $100bn and create 700,000 jobs. \u00adReopening the battle with China over its currency is not a bad move, therefore, as Mr Obama faces difficult midterm elections in November. Both the US and China are trying to power their way forward with export booms and each requires a low valuation of its currency to do that. But politics matter too. China&apos;s foreign policy has become more assertive as nationalism becomes dominant. For all the lip service to multilateralism, China is more hostile to sanctions on Iran than Russia. A nationalist China is, however, more tied into the global economy than ever before. Two-thirds of China&apos;s $2.4 trillion currency reserves are held in dollars. If it dumped the US treasury bonds and shares in which these dollars are invested, China could trigger a collapse of the dollar, and world markets, and another global recession. To whom would China be able to export then? Certainly not to the US or the EU. China&apos;s key economic interest lies in continuing to fund US debt. So there are limits to the current US-China jousting. Each is repainting its red lines and stepping over the other&apos;s. But at some point national interest says this must stop. Neither of the tetchy twins can do without the other."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/10/iran-china-us-nuclear-sanctions", "publicationDate": "2010-02-10T18:26:24Z", "tags": ["Iran", "Nuclear weapons", "Obama administration", "US news", "China", "Russia", "World news", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Beijing is furious with Washington over its recent sale of more than $6bn (\u00a33.8bn) in arms to Taiwan, which it views as a breakaway region."], "title": "US faces diplomatic slog to get China to back sanctions against Iran", "article": "The US was today spearheading a diplomatic campaign to overcome \u00adChinese opposition to further sanctions aimed at Iran and its Revolutionary Guards in a renewed push following Tehran&apos;s decision to \u00adproduce uranium almost six times more \u00adenriched than its existing stockpile. Barack Obama said yesterday that his administration was &quot;developing a significant regime of sanctions that will indicate to them [Iran] how isolated they are from the international community as a whole&quot;. Those sanctions will target a wide range of business interests belonging to Iran&apos;s Revolutionary Guards, which is accused of running a covert weapons programme behind the front of a \u00adcivilian nuclear industry, as well as a missile development programme. To help convince Beijing of the need to act, Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, is due to fly to Qatar and Saudi Arabia this weekend, in part to \u00addiscuss assurances the Gulf states could give China that its oil and gas needs would be met during the sanctions period. Tehran said yesterday it had begun making 20% enriched uranium, with the aim of producing medical isotopes. Western officials described the move as a new act of defiance of UN resolutions that would bring Iran significantly closer to the capacity to make a nuclear bomb. Obama said he expected UN negotiations to move quickly. But European diplomats warned that those talks would be hindered by Chinese resistance to new punitive measures against Iran. &quot;We think it is going to be slow going,&quot; said one, pointing to the poor state of US-Chinese relations. Beijing is furious with Washington over its recent sale of more than $6bn (\u00a33.8bn) in arms to Taiwan, which it views as a breakaway region. It is also irritated by Obama&apos;s decision to meet the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. Even before the recent dip in bilateral ties, China was reluctant to endorse sanctions which it described as ineffective and damaging to its extensive economic ties to Iran. A Foreign Office \u00adofficial said the potential crisis caused by Iran&apos;s nuclear ambitions, including the prospect of Israeli military action, would not be in China&apos;s long-term interests. &quot;You would think China would take the long view of its interests,&quot; the official said. &quot;On this, I am not sure it is doing that.&quot; Russia, which had taken the lead in resisting sanctions until last year, signalled it would back punitive measures this time. &quot;Iran says it doesn&apos;t want to have nuclear weapons. But its actions, including its decision to enrich uranium to 20%, have raised doubts among other nations, and these doubts are quite well-founded,&quot; Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Russia&apos;s security council, said. Iran&apos;s decision to make 20% enriched uranium follows the collapse of a deal, agreed in principle last year, by which Russia would carry out the enrichment and France would turn the processed uranium into fuel rods. The agreement broke down because Iran was not prepared to wait between the export of its uranium for processing and the receipt of the fuel rods. Negotiators for three other parties to the deal, the US, France and Russia, insisted on the time gap to reduce the size of Iran&apos;s uranium stockpile, for the time it took the uranium to be enriched and made into rods. The percentage degree of uranium enrichment is a measure of the concentration of the fissile isotope, U-235. At the level of 90% enrichment and above the uranium can be used to make a nuclear bomb. Owing to the nature of the enrichment process, in which uranium hexafluoride gas is fed into linked arrays of spinning centrifuges, it takes considerably less effort to turn 20% enriched uranium into 90%, than it takes to make 20% uranium from the current enrichment level of 3.5%."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/feb/10/us-china-iran-nuclear-sanctions", "publicationDate": "2010-02-11T11:16:09Z", "tags": ["Iran", "Nuclear weapons", "China", "Obama administration", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The Americans find themselves having to plead for Chinese support in imposing new UN sanctions on Iran, only days after infuriating Beijing with arms sales to Taiwan and an announcement of a meeting with Dalai Lama.", "The conference was under Chatham House rules, but broadly speaking: the Chinese were furious about the Taiwan arms sale, arguing it had come at a time when relations between the island and mainland China were at their best for years."], "title": "Beijing's choice", "article": "Nothing seems to be going right for the Obama administration, at home and abroad.

It is a bit like driving your car across your neighbour&apos;s lawn and only then remembering you badly need to borrow their mower. China&apos;s instinct now, some believe, is to seek to build anti-American coalitions, rather than find common ground with Washington. Such dysfunctional global relationships were much at the heart of the matter in Abu Dhabi over the past couple of days, at a conference entitled Emerging Powers, Global Security and the Middle East. It was put on by New York University&apos;s Centre on International Cooperation and the Brookings Institution, and brought together government officials, former ministers, advisers and academics from the US, Asia and Europe. (There was no one from Iran \u2013 the days when Iranians could leave their country to attend such events are visibly dying away). The conference was under Chatham House rules, but broadly speaking: the Chinese were furious about the Taiwan arms sale, arguing it had come at a time when relations between the island and mainland China were at their best for years. They warned that Chinese nationalism was slowly awakening and should not be provoked. The current political turmoil in Iran actually serves to harden China&apos;s resistance to sanctions, because it makes them appear more like interference in another country&apos;s affairs \u2013 foreign policy anathema to Beijing.  Others hit back at a rising nation they saw as seeking more global power than responsibility. The westerners urged China to play more of a broader role in the Middle East, beyond its immediate energy needs. India is angry at what it sees as China&apos;s increased assertiveness along their common border. The Gulf Arabs accused China of allowing Iran to get away with its nuclear manoeuvring. Interestingly enough, it was clear at a public function put on as part of the conference, that &quot;ordinary&quot; Arabs, outside the government and thinktanks, were more sympathetic to Tehran&apos;s case. Last Autumn, there was a plan for the Gulf states to offer China solid reassurances about its energy supply in the event of sanctions on Iran. It is not clear whether that has happened in any organised or sustained fashion. Hillary Clinton is on the way to the region this weekend, to try to get that initiative restarted, but that would require GCC unity on Iran, a commodity that is still in short supply. There was no clear outcome in Abu Dhabi, of course, just as there is no clear decision in Beijing. It is apparent that the Chinese government feels the time has come for it to stand alone among the P5 if necessary to defend its interests.

Every US president for the past 20 years has met the exiled spiritual leader. Obama delayed their meeting because he wanted to visit China first. That led to accusations he was soft-pedalling.View from BeijingChina accuses the Dalai Lama of heading separatist forces \u2013 he says he seeks only meaningful autonomy \u2013 and has taken a tough line on his meetings with heads of state, particularly since his high-profile 2007 visit to the US. In 2008 it cancelled an EU summit after learning that French president Nicolas Sarkozy was to meet him.How serious could the row become?It is unlikely to escalate, although the fact that the meeting coincides with other frictions has complicated matters. China was keen to avoid a rerun of 2007, when George W Bush presented the Dalai Lama with the Congressional Gold Medal; it can live, albeit unhappily, with a private meeting at the White House. Tension 2 Sanctions on Iran Alienating a vital provider of energy has no rewards What&apos;s the problem?The west is pushing for substantial United Nations sanctions against Iran to curb a nuclear programme which it believes is pursuing military as well as civilian goals.View from the westThe US defence secretary, Robert Gates, said last week that he wanted to see sanctions imposed in &quot;weeks, not months&quot;. Western leaders warn that Iran is not serious about reaching a deal.View from BeijingIran, led by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is a key ally and energy supplier; China, a member of the UN security council, feels it has little to gain from alienating it. It argues that diplomatic avenues have not been exhausted, that Iran&apos;s pursuit of nuclear weapons is not proved, and that sanctions will be ineffective. The US has sought to persuade Beijing by trying to set up a deal to safeguard its energy supplies and warning of the potential for Israeli military action.How serious could the row become?China&apos;s Foreign Ministry warned that the row over America&apos;s recent arms sale to Taiwan would &quot;inevitably&quot; affect regional and international co-operation \u2013 a comment many read as a signal that China would not play ball on Iran. Beijing could feel isolated if Moscow continues to stand alongside western powers, but even if it agrees to sanctions they are likely to be too watered down to satisfy others. Tension 3 Arms sales to Taiwan Despite the mainland&apos;s ritual fury, Taipei did not get all its wish-list What&apos;s the problem?The US is to sell Taiwan $6.4bn (\u00a34bn) of arms \u2013 including Patriot missiles, mine-hunter ships and Black Hawk helicopters \u2013 under a deal agreed by the Bush administration.The view from the west The deal is necessary to keep the security balance in the region. The US also has a legal duty to help Taiwan defend itself; Beijing has more than 1,000 missiles pointing across the Taiwan Strait and says it could take military action if the self-ruled island seeks formal independence. However, Washington has not included the F16 fighter jets or submarine technology Taipei seeks.View from Beijing Its response to the announcement has been unusually strong: as well as suspending military exchanges, it threatened to place sanctions on US firms involved in the deal. Some analysts say leaders are seeking to defend their policy of thawing cross-strait relations; others that they want to prevent the sale of F16s and the like in future.How serious could the row become?It is probably not as bad as it looks. Despite suspending military exchanges, China appears to have approved a visit by the supercarrier USS\u00a0Nimitz \u2013 one of the largest warships in the world \u2013 to Hong Kong this week. Experts suspect sanctions may be used to send a signal, but will probably not have a significant impact on US firms. Tension 4 Currency A slow march towards new trade balance  What&apos;s the problem?The strength of the renminbi has been a long-running battle. Economists say it is undervalued by as much as 40% \u2013 encouraging cheap Chinese exports to flood other countries (thereby keeping down inflation, point out the Chinese) while discouraging imports.View from the west A substantial rise in the currency&apos;s value is necessary. Earlier this month Obama vowed to take a tougher stand on trade; given the state of the US economy, there is growing domestic clamour for action.View from Beijing China says it will not submit to pressure and accuses the US and Europe of protectionism. The recovery of exports (which plummeted last year) has persuaded many Chinese economists that appreciation is needed to head off nascent inflation and encourage a much-needed rebalancing of the economy, but Beijing will not want to look as if it has been pushed into a revaluation.How serious could the row become?There are fears this issue, alongside other trade frictions, could lead to tit-for-tat action, particularly if Obama formally labels China a currency manipulator. But China&apos;s deputy commerce minister last week dismissed prospects of a trade war; given their economic interdependence, all are likely to tread carefully. Many experts predict a slow, unheralded appreciation this year, but to a level far below US expectations. Tension 5 Human rights &apos;There are no\u00a0dissidents, only criminals&apos;  What&apos;s the problem?Human rights groups and foreign diplomats fear there is a growing attack on China&apos;s already fragile civil society, citing increased pressure on lawyers, internet censorship and a more punitive attitude to activists and dissidents, including writer Liu Xiaobo, sentenced to 11 years for subversion.View from the westChina is not abiding by its own constitution, never mind international law, and must clean up its act if it wishes to be respected as a global power.View from BeijingChina argues that other countries should not interfere in its domestic affairs. Asked about Liu&apos;s case last week, a Foreign Ministry spokesman told reporters: &quot;China has no &apos;dissidents&apos;. We only act in accordance with the law. There is only the difference between criminals and those who are not criminals.&quot; Some say western professions of concern are hypocritical and just another stick to beat China, given the record of the US and other countries on issues such as Guant\u00e1namo Bay.How serious could the row become?Both Chinese analysts and human rights campaigners are sceptical about whether western governments will make it a priority, particularly given the other issues \u2013 such as Iran \u2013 that they face. Tension 6 Google and censorship Defiant stand in web battle  What&apos;s the problem?Google said last month it was no longer willing to censor its Chinese service, citing a China-originated cyber-attack that targeted human rights activists&apos; email accounts.View from the west The Chinese should at least investigate the Google attack, which many suspect was sponsored or tacitly condoned by the government. China needs to roll back increasing online censorship and increase freedom of information.View from BeijingInitially gave a muted response to Google&apos;s bombshell. But Hillary Clinton&apos;s intervention prompted an angry fightback. State media accused the US of &quot;online warfare&quot;, saying that it stirred up unrest in Iran.How serious could the row become?Google has said that it would like to remain in China. While officials are extremely unlikely to allow an uncensored search service, the firm might be able to maintain an advertising wing, for instance.

It has brushed aside criticism on human rights and sought to export censorship, pressing overseas film festivals to drop documentaries on Tibet and Xinjiang. But some of the recent tension has been overplayed. President Obama&apos;s predecessors also met the Dalai Lama and China objected in each case. The two are scheduled to meet on Thursday. Analysts also say Beijing has exerted more pressure on North Korea of late. From Beijing&apos;s point of view, the west is making unrealistic demands \u2013 expecting it not only to understand other countries&apos; priorities, but also to compromise its own interests. &quot;Some people&apos;s expectation of China was that, with economic development, foreign policy and political reform would become westernised,&quot; said Feng. A lot of people don&apos;t think a responsible great power just does what the US expects it to do.&quot; Victor Gao, director of the China National Association of International Studies, argued that the US shopping list was increasingly long. &quot;The arms sales to Taiwan and the visit of the Dalai Lama take place at a time they need help on Iran\u2026 What are the top three issues for America? If they put Tibet or Taiwan in there, I would be amazed,&quot; he said. That helps to explain why China sees no point in yielding on certain issues. &quot;Beijing&apos;s new assertiveness is less the result of its growing economic clout than the realisation that [ultimately] western governments care far less about human rights than about trade and economics,&quot; said Nicholas Bequelin, Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. Elsewhere in the world, China&apos;s rise is met with as much enthusiasm as fear. Neighbours may be alarmed by its growing might, but there is greater enthusiasm on other continents. Professor Deborah Brautigam, whose recent book The Dragon&apos;s Gift examines the Chinese presence in Africa, said that, while some there see China as &quot;the new colonialist&quot;, others have welcomed it. &quot;African leaders and commentators expressing this view are not naive about Chinese interest in Africa. But they actually like to hear the Chinese talk about investment opportunities instead of aid [and] are intrigued by models such as the resource-backed infrastructure loans,&quot; she said. Analysts predict further tension, rather than a spectacular confrontation, between China and the west. Gao argues that the stakes are too high for both sides. &quot;The decision-makers in this town are cautious, prudent people; not because they are afraid of the other side, but because they know increasing friction is bad for China, bad for the US and bad for the world,&quot; he said. Beijing may be increasingly confident, but it does not yet believe its smooth ascendancy is a given. Underneath the veneer of confidence lie persistent anxieties about the true strength of its economy and society, and how to handle issues such as soaring inequality and endemic corruption. Such domestic vulnerabilities enhance the appeal of promoting popular nationalism, yet also reinforce the potential dangers of international disputes. &quot;What many observers see [as greater assertiveness] is in fact the product of a larger debate and policy struggle in Beijing about where China should be in the next 10 years and how it should get there,&quot; argued Russell Leigh Moses, a Beijing-based political analyst. The only real agreement thus far is that China is not to be pushed around, and so you get over-reaction and elbowing and jersey-tugging from many officials here.&quot; And at street level, while many ordinary Chinese people celebrate their country&apos;s rise with pride, others are deeply cynical about its prospects. &quot;We&apos;re a nuclear power, but are we prepared to use military power against anyone?&quot; complained another of Han&apos;s fireworks buyers, who declined to give his name. &quot;The statistics that China provides about its economy are all fake. A lot of graduates can&apos;t get jobs. When \u00adoutsiders come to Beijing it takes seven or 10 years to get a hukou [household \u00adregistration], yet getting a US green card might not take them that long. I&apos;m not sure whether China&apos;s stronger as a country \u2013 but its citizens aren&apos;t.&quot; If such pessimistic judg ments prove well-founded, the Chinese political establishment may face as much pressure from within as without, as it attempts to consolidate superpower status in 2010."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/14/hillary-clinton-iran-nuclear-policy", "publicationDate": "2010-02-14T17:19:00Z", "tags": ["Iran", "US news", "Hillary Clinton", "China", "Qatar", "Saudi Arabia", "Saudi Arabia", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Chinese resistance has been deepened by a recent cooling of relations with Washington, particularly over arms sales to Taiwan and Barack Obama&apos;s scheduled meeting with the Dalai Lama at the White House next week."], "title": "Hillary Clinton urges Iran to reconsider 'dangerous' nuclear policy", "article": "Hillary Clinton today called on Iran to rethink its &quot;dangerous&quot; nuclear policy or face the threat of &quot;greater costs&quot; being imposed by the international community. The US secretary of state&apos;s remarks, made in Doha, Qatar, launched a US campaign to win Middle East backing for a new set of sanctions against Iran following Tehran&apos;s decision to make more highly enriched uranium. &quot;Iran leaves the international community little choice but to impose greater costs for its provocative steps,&quot; she said. &quot;Together, we are encouraging Iran to reconsider its dangerous policy decisions.&quot; Officials travelling with Clinton said one of the main aims of her trip would be to encourage Saudi Arabia \u2013 where she is due to arrive tomorrow \u2013 and other Gulf states to reassure China that its energy supply would not be interrupted in the event of punitive measures against Iran. &quot;We believe that all countries have a part to play in helping to sharpen the question for Iran,&quot; Jeffrey Feltman, a senior state department official, told reporters. &quot;We would expect [the Saudis] to use these visits, to use their relationships, in ways that can help increase the pressure that Iran would feel.&quot; Other US officials were quoted as saying privately that Saudi Arabia had already made some overtures to China on fuel assurances. China is the only permanent member of the UN security council currently threatening to veto a fourth round of sanctions after Iran&apos;s announcement that it would produce 20% enriched uranium. That level of enrichment \u2013 measured by the concentration of the fissile isotope U-235 \u2013 is more than five times greater than Iran&apos;s current stockpile. Tehran says it needs the new fuel for a medical research reactor, but western governments point out that the step brings it significantly closer to weapons-grade uranium, which is more than 80% enriched. The Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, last week said Iran had no wish to wake weapons-grade uranium but could do so if it wanted to. Western experts, however, believe Iranian scientists would still face many technical obstacles. Clinton was due to meet the Qatari and Turkish prime ministers at a forum on US relations with the Islamic world, where she was set to deliver a speech on the future of the Middle East. She is expected to see King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia in Riyadh tomorrow. As part of Washington&apos;s diplomatic campaign against Tehran, one of her deputies, Jacob Lew, has been despatched to Egypt and Israel, while another, James Steinberg, will go to Israel next week. William Burns, another senior state department official, is due to visit Syria \u2013 Iran&apos;s closest regional ally \u2013 and Lebanon, currently a member of the security council. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN watchdog, is this week expected to censure Iran for making the leap to 20% enrichment without giving its inspectors adequate notice as it was obliged to do under its &quot;safeguards agreement&quot; with the body. Last Tuesday, IAEA inspectors were summoned to the enrichment plant in Natanz to witness the transfer of 10kg of Iran&apos;s stockpile of low enriched uranium 9 (LEU) to an experimental centrifuge facility. When they returned the next day, they were told the LEU had already been fed into some centrifuges the night before. A classified IAEA document noted that, under the agreement, &quot;the agency had requested that no LEU be fed into the process at PFEP [the pilot fuel enrichment plant] before the agency was able to adjust its existing safeguards procedures at that facility&quot;. The US, Britain and France are promoting sanctions that would target the extensive business holdings of Iran&apos;s Revolutionary Guard, a paramilitary force which constitutes a state within a state and has grown more powerful as a result of Iran&apos;s prolonged political crisis. China has so far opposed such sanctions, arguing they would be ineffective and even counter-productive. Chinese resistance has been deepened by a recent cooling of relations with Washington, particularly over arms sales to Taiwan and Barack Obama&apos;s scheduled meeting with the Dalai Lama at the White House next week. The Obama administration hopes to persuade Beijing that its strategic interests lie with oil-producing US allies in the region rather than Tehran."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/15/guns-n-roses-surprise-gig", "publicationDate": "2010-02-15T10:00:56Z", "tags": ["Guns N' Roses", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Fans in Taiwan, South Korea and Canada, who spent hundreds to see the band during their last tour, were probably less enthused."], "title": "Guns N' Roses play surprise gig to half-empty club", "article": "The world died a little on Friday, as Guns N&apos; Roses played to the half-empty fashion boutique that was once CBGBs.

The man himself only appeared in darkness, with his voice distorted. This was both tricksy self-portrait and cheeky docu-scam, satirising contemporary art craziness. Blanked-out tongue somewhere in his pixelated cheek, Banksy tells us the story of his supposed relationship with a hyperactive French videographer, one Thierry Guetta, who has, it seems, been following him around \u2013 Boswell to Banksy&apos;s Johnson. A few years back, allegedly encouraged by Banksy, this man apparently suddenly stopped being an amateur cameraman and suddenly turned into a self-taught street artist called Mr Brainwash, flogging his suspiciously accomplished Warhol-Banksy knockoffs in LA for tens of thousands of dollars. And these works do exist; you can buy them \u2013 which is more than you can say for the creations of Nat Tate, that mysterious individual playfully chronicled by William Boyd in 1998. Though little known to the common herd, &quot;Mr Brainwash&quot; may come to be accepted as an important artist, the way Andrew and Imogen Quest became revered socialites in Evelyn Waugh&apos;s Vile Bodies. Anyway, Mr Brainwash is one of Banksy&apos;s most enjoyable creations.           Exit Through the Gift Shop is an entertaining guide to Banksy&apos;s exploits, which are endlessly gripping and hilarious. He has gloriously mocked Israel&apos;s West Bank wall with his graffiti; he has ripped a London phone box in half and he has apparently fabricated boxfuls of \u00a310 notes with Princess Diana&apos;s face on them, so realistic that they could get him imprisoned for forgery. Is it true? Is the story itself a forgery? Or is the point that Banksy&apos;s art inhales the spirit of forgery, making free with established images, brand currencies and the emblems of power? Who knows? Banksy&apos;s film is an enjoyable stunt: not quite Man On Wire, but Man Completely Wired. On a more serious note, the festival gave us the colossal premiere of the restored Metropolis by Fritz Lang, returning in its complete form \u2013 after lost footage was discovered two years ago in Buenos Aires \u2013 to the city where it was first unveiled in 1927. The new two-and-a-half-hour Metropolis was performed with a live orchestral accompaniment, and the rediscovered segments were obvious for being fizzier and grainier than the rest, as if viewed through heavy rain. Lang&apos;s bizarre sci-fi dystopian fairytale noir now looks bigger, madder, absurder and more fascinating than ever. Its story of a city serviced by underground slaves is even more satirically relevant in 2010, as we witness the disintegration of the urban fantasy of Dubai, built on credit and globalised labour. Metropolis is a bad-trip premonition of the 20th-century&apos;s ideologies of class and race, and the &quot;stadium&quot; scenes of super-fit patrician sportsmen running really do look like something by Leni Riefenstahl, who has a tiny resemblance to Lang&apos;s heroine Maria. Maria, of course, fervently expects the appearance of a messianic Mediator who will save this corrupt city-state, a Mediator she calls &quot;Mittler&quot;. Did Germany&apos;s collective unconscious mis-hear that name? The festival&apos;s official opening film was a surprisingly low-key choice, but still outstanding: Apart Together, by the Chinese director and former Golden Bear winner Wang Quan&apos;an. Berlin is a festival which loves its stars and red-carpet glamour, and the decision to open with this quiet, heartfelt movie from a relatively little-known name, rather than the headline-grabbers such as Roman Polanski&apos;s The Ghost Writer and Martin Scorsese&apos;s Shutter Island which were also on the bill, was criticised in the German press here. But in my view, Berlin could not have got off to a better start than with this outstanding movie: a wonderfully gentle, intimate, wonderfully composed family drama that, like Hirokazu Kore-eda&apos;s Japanese film Still Walking, might contribute to a new world cinema trend: neo-Ozu. Ling Feng plays Lui Yangsheng, a former soldier in the Kuomintang, who was exiled as a young man to Taiwan, forced to leave behind the woman he loved and their baby. He remarried, but now as a very old widower, Lui returns to Shanghai to make contact with his lost love Qiao Yue (Lisa Lu), who herself married long ago and is now a grandmother. His re-appearance causes excitement and then astonishment and outrage in Qiao Yue&apos;s family when it becomes clear that this stranger has never stopped loving her, and now wishes to take her back with him to Taiwan, offering up to the family his (modest) savings and pension. Everyone is disturbed, except, it seems, for Qiao Yue&apos;s husband \u2013 a terrific performance from Xu Caigen \u2013 who remains heart-rendingly friendly and polite to the stranger, apparently on the grounds that his wife once loved him. But is there something more complex, more enigmatic going on in this man&apos;s heart and mind? A trio of outstanding performances makes this film one of the gems of the festival. Sadly, the only way was down after this, with the awful Howl, by Rob Epstein, a documentarist much admired for his 1984 non-fiction film about Harvey Milk. James Franco plays Ginsberg, apparently chatting to an off-camera interviewer at the very moment that his publisher, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, was fighting a censorship battle in court: Jon &quot;Mad Men&quot; Hamm plays the goodie defending attorney and David Strathairn plays the baddie prosecutor. We get toe-curlingly embarrassing &quot;animated&quot; sequences \u2013 which I can only describe as a sexed-up version of the twee cartoons that used to accompany prog tracks on the BBC&apos;s Old Grey Whistle Test \u2013 supposedly dramatising the passionate swirl of Ginsberg&apos;s poetry. This is endlessly, boringly, declaimed and re-declaimed. Reams of stuff re-appear. Sometimes we see Franco doing the declaiming, at a live reading, to an irritating collection of nodding, smiling and generally appreciative cap-wearing hipsters, who made me long for the re-introduction of national service. The film is quite extraordinarily repetitive and dull, with no real insight into Ginsberg&apos;s life, sexuality or writing. The festival&apos;s new German cinema sidebar offered Renn, Wenn Du Kannst or Run, If You Can, by Dietrich Br\u00fcggemann: a serio-comic twentysomething relationship picture, starring Robert Gwisdek as Ben, a young man who has been confined to using a wheelchair following an incident which is not fully revealed until the last act. He is smart, acid, cynical, secretly despairing, having fallen in love with a woman that he has whimsically encouraged his long-suffering volunteer carer to chat up. There are shrewd, painful insights here about the relationships possible, and perhaps not possible, between disabled and non-disabled people. But I felt that a small, sharp, real film had got lost inside a bigger, more unfocused heart-tugging comedy. Thomas Vinterberg, the Danish Dogme veteran, had a new film at Berlin: Submarino was the story of two brothers who were traumatised as boys by a neglectful and alcoholic mother, a formative agony which lays the foundation for a tragic adulthood on both. The movie is presented in dramatic-diptych form, passing from the story of one brother to the other: it was heartfelt and engaging, well acted and put across with power. Like Susanne Bier&apos;s Danish film Brothers, this could well find itself being remade by Hollywood. The New Romanian Wave saw another new and important contributor emerge in Berlin. If I Want to Whistle, I Whistle, by the first-time film-maker Florin Serban, is set in a grim youth prison, where Silviu \u2013 a great performance from 19-year-old George Pistereanu \u2013 has only five days to go before release. Yet he is tipped over the edge by an unexpected visit from his kid brother, a crisis which results in violence and a gripping hostage situation. Berlin is sometimes accused of being low-key compared with Cannes and Venice \u2013 but there are some powerful, valuable films."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/17/obam-defies-beijing-dalai-lama", "publicationDate": "2010-02-18T01:39:00Z", "tags": ["Dalai Lama", "Barack Obama", "US news", "China", "Tibet", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The Tibetan leader flew into Washington from India yesterday for the start of a 10-day US tour, which coincides with serious rows over the proposed US sale of military equipment to Taiwan and the US-China trade imbalance."], "title": "Obama risks China's wrath to meet Dalai Lama", "article": "Barack Obama is to go ahead with talks with the Dalai Lama at the White House today and risk inflicting more damage on the already strained relations between the US and China. The Tibetan leader flew into Washington from India yesterday for the start of a 10-day US tour, which coincides with serious rows over the proposed US sale of military equipment to Taiwan and the US-China trade imbalance. While rejecting a Chinese call to cancel the meeting, the White House offered the conciliatory gesture of making the talks low-profile. The White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said yesterday only an official photograph would be issued afterwards, suggesting that there would be none of the usual televised footage of the initial exchanges between the president and his visitor. In a further gesture to China, the White House stressed that the Dalai Lama was being greeted as Tibet&apos;s spiritual leader, rather than as head of state or political leader and that the meeting was private, to be held in the Map Room rather than the more official Oval Office. The Dalai Lama is also to meet the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. A state department spokesman, Mark Toner, yesterday emphasised the meeting was on the basis of his religious and cultural standing rather than as a political leader. &quot;The Dalai Lama is a Nobel peace prize laureate, internationally revered religious and cultural leader and the secretary will meet him in this capacity as recent secretaries of state have done,&quot; Toner said. China has hinted at reprisals, as it has done against other countries whose leaders have met the Dalai Lama, and threatened to suspend military exchanges. But there were signs yesterday that China may have decided the deterioration in relations is in danger of getting out of hand. There had been speculation that it would deny entry to Hong Kong to the carrier USS Nimitz but it docked as planned yesterday. The only blip came when officers from the People&apos;s Liberation Army, stationed in Hong Kong, failed to respond to an invitation to attend a reception with US navy officers aboard the carrier. Its commander, Rear Admiral John Miller, played down tensions and described the Hong Kong visit as routine. &quot;We had a request pending, and about a week or so ago it was approved and we&apos;ve been on our way ever since,&quot; he told reporters aboard the ship, which had sailed from Malaysia. If China does decide to retaliate, it could choose to suspend further planned military exchanges or postpone a visit to the United States by the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, that had been pencilled in for April. The Dalai Lama, 74, who left his home in Dharamsala, in the foothills of the Himalayas, on Tuesday for New Delhi, has been described by Beijing as &quot;a wolf in monk&apos;s clothing&quot;. The Tibetan leader visited the US twice last year but Obama refused to see him, explaining that he first wanted to visit China, which he did in November. Obama sent one of his closest advisers, Valerie Jarrett, to Dharamsala late last year to set up today&apos;s meeting. The Dalai Lama&apos;s spokesman, Tenzin Taklha, said that no matter what China said, it cared about international opinion and the important thing was that the American meeting was taking place, sending a signal to Beijing to work with the Tibetan leaders. The Dalai Lama will brief Obama on talks that have been held since 2008 between Tibetan leaders and Beijing, which have so far produced no results. Beijing claims the Dalai Lama backs independence for Tibet, while he says he favours only greater autonomy. Foreign affairs analysts in Washington are divided over whether Obama should have gone ahead with the meeting when relations between the US and China are so difficult. Steve Clemons, of Washington&apos;s New America Foundation, said: &quot;I do not think it should have gone ahead. While it would have been hard for human rights activists, we did not do the prep work. It looks like a punitive act. &quot;I would want him to meet him but this is the wrong time, with a stack-up of issues. I think it is a mistake.&quot; China has frustrated Obama by refusing so far to join other members of the United Nations security council in supporting sanctions against Iran. A small trade war between Denmark and China started in May last year after a Danish meeting with the Dalai Lama."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/18/obama-meets-dalai-lama", "publicationDate": "2010-02-18T22:02:32Z", "tags": ["Barack Obama", "Obama administration", "Dalai Lama", "US news", "Tibet", "China", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Robert Gibbs, Obama&apos;s spokesman, said Obama praised the Dalai Lama for seeking dialogue with China over Tibet, but he added: &quot;The president and the Dalai Lama agreed on the importance of a positive and co-operative relationship between the United States and China.&quot; China has threatened retaliatory action against the US over the visit, which comes on top of rows between the two countries over trade, arms sales to Taiwan and accusations of cyberspying."], "title": "White House adopts low profile as Barack Obama meets Dalai Lama", "article": "Barack Obama expressed &quot;strong support&quot; for the Tibetan way of life when he saw the Dalai Lama at the White House today, a meeting that risks further damaging US-China relations.

The Dalai Lama, speaking afterwards, said he was very happy with the meeting and that Obama had been &quot;very much supportive&quot;. He said Obama had shown genuine concern for Tibet. He was in a playful mood as he left the meeting, drawing patterns in the heaps of snow outside the White House and flicking some at waiting reporters, his jollity contrasting with the seriousness of the visit and its potential consequences. Obama gave the Dalai Lama more than an hour, long enough to be polite to him and to show that he would not be cowed by Chinese demands not to meet the spiritual leader of Tibet. But, in deference to Chinese hostility, the White House kept the meeting as low-key as possible. There was no television footage of the two together and the meeting was in the map room rather than the oval office, a small but symbolic gesture to show that it was not an official event. Trying to avoid accusations of interference in China&apos;s internal politics, Obama confined himself to support for &quot;Tibet&apos;s unique religious, cultural and linguistic identity and the protection of human rights for Tibetans in the People&apos;s Republic of China&quot; \u2013 but pointedly did not call for greater autonomy for Tibet.

Washington is hoping that Beijing will not cancel visits to the US by the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, planned for April and November, or take other reprisals. In a statement released this morning, and carried on Chinese state media websites, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the US had &quot;grossly violated norms governing international relations&quot; in going ahead with the meeting. Spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said that Washington should stop interfering in China&apos;s internal affairs and take concrete action - which he did not specify - to &quot;wipe out the baneful impact&quot; and maintain the healthy and steady growth of Sino-US relations. He added that the US should stop conniving and supporting anti-China separatist forces that seek &quot;Tibet independence.&quot; Beijing, which invaded Tibet in 1959, regards it as part of China and dismisses the Dalai Lama, the leader at the time, as a feudal monk and separatist. The Dalai Lama, as a compromise, backs greater autonomy for Tibet within the Chinese republic. The Dalai Lama emerged from the White House meeting in maroon robes and bare-armed, in spite of the winter cold. He stopped to draw a pattern in the snow, that some reporters claimed afterwards resembled a tiger&apos;s paw, to celebrate Chinese New Year. He made a short statement to reporters, mainly praising Obama as a champion of democracy, freedom and human values, and promised to take questions at a later press conference. About 300 supporters of the Dalai Lama demonstrated outside the White House. One of the organisers, Tenzin Dorje, who favours independence, said the fact that the two had met at all was important. &quot;The US wants a good relationship with the Chinese government. The Tibetans want a good relationship with the Chinese government. Only the Chinese government does not want this,&quot; he said. Tibetans living close to the Dalai Lama&apos;s birthplace in north-west China have heralded his meeting with a midnight display of fireworks. The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader remains widely revered in his homeland and residents said they were delighted that he would meet Obama. &quot;It is so important for us that the US has not given in to threats and will meet our leader,&quot; a monk told Reuters."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/19/china-us-obama-dalai-lama", "publicationDate": "2010-02-19T09:21:58Z", "tags": ["Tibet", "US news", "China", "Dalai Lama", "Barack Obama", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The move comes amid tensions between the two countries over issues including arms sales to Taiwan, trade, tackling nuclear proliferation and internet censorship."], "title": "China complains to US about Obama-Dalai Lama meeting", "article": "Beijing today summoned the US ambassador to complain about Barack Obama&apos;s meeting with the Dalai Lama, state media reported.

But China did not threaten retaliation of any kind and its response was relatively measured, reflecting the low-key nature of the event and the fact that Obama&apos;s predecessors also met the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. The move comes amid tensions between the two countries over issues including arms sales to Taiwan, trade, tackling nuclear proliferation and internet censorship.

Obama spent more than an hour with the Dalai Lama. But the meeting was held in the Map Room of the White House rather than the Oval Office and reporters and cameramen were banned. Officials issued a single photo of the two men. The president voiced support for &quot;Tibet&apos;s unique religious, cultural and linguistic identity and the protection of human rights for Tibetans in the People&apos;s Republic of China&quot; and encouraged the Dalai Lama to continue seeking dialogue with China.

The Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, Tip O&apos;Neill, said: &quot;Haig hadn&apos;t been secretary of state more than three weeks when he told me over breakfast that we ought to be cleaning out Nicaragua.&quot; Though he clearly did not understand it at the time, Haig&apos;s poorly hidden presidential ambitions were scuppered in those early days with his lamentable performance after the assassination attempt on Reagan in March 1981. Amid the inevitable confusion, the secretary of state burst into the White House press room to declare, when a reporter asked who was making the decisions: &quot;As of now, I&apos;m in control here in the White House.&quot; He later said that at the moment he was asked, he was technically right. But his apparent ignorance of the constitutional lines of power left an abiding impression of impetuousness and arrogance, all the greater for being caught on television. When he did run as a Republican hopeful for the White House in 1988, he rated just 3% in the opinion polls. While Haig&apos;s preoccupation with Central America had a greater long-term impact on America&apos;s internal and foreign politics, the greatest crisis he faced at the state department was the 1982 Falklands war, in which he tried unsuccessfully to act as mediator, flying to both London and Buenos Aires in the process. There was probably little chance of success, but his efforts were seriously undermined by undisguised support for the Argentinians from the US ambassador to the UN, Jeane Kirkpatrick.     Though Haig flew to both London and Buenos Aires, his efforts to avert the Falklands war of 1982 proved fruitless. Photograph: Herbie Knott/Rex Features    In his memoirs, Haig commented: &quot;The war was caused by the original miscalculation on the part of the Argentinian military junta that a western democracy was too soft, too decadent to defend itself. This delusion on the part of undemocratic governments has been, and remains, the greatest danger to peace in this century.&quot; But his failure to avert the conflict, as he also conceded, &quot;ultimately cost me my job as secretary of state&quot;. His reign had been marked by ferocious battles, set out in loving detail in his memoirs, over bureaucratic turf with Reagan&apos;s kitchen cabinet. However, even Haig&apos;s well-honed skills were inadequate on this field, and he lost the fight in June 1982, when Reagan handed him a letter accepting his resignation. Since Haig had not actually offered it, he got to work on a draft. It was still not complete when he heard the president announce his departure on television. The pattern of Haig&apos;s life was set early. Born and brought up in Bala Cynwyd, one of the classier suburbs of Philadelphia, he was the middle child of a prosperous lawyer. But the family&apos;s comfortable life was shattered when his father died of cancer at the age of 38. Haig was then 10, and no more than average academically. He had gained a scholarship to a Roman Catholic preparatory school but did not do well. It was withdrawn after a couple of years and he transferred to a local high school. Though his mother was keen he should follow his father&apos;s calling, he was intent on a military career. Confirming his headteacher&apos;s view that &quot;Al is definitely not West Point material&quot;, his application to the US military academy failed. Then his uncle, who had been supporting Haig&apos;s mother and his siblings, intervened and in 1944 Haig scraped into the military college, situated to the north of New York, as an acknowledged political appointee. Under the stress of war, the four-year course for officers had been cut to three. The topics removed from the curriculum included English, social sciences and history, in all of which Haig later proved deficient. He graduated from West Point in 1947, finishing 214th out of 310. His classmates shrewdly assessed him as having &quot;strong convictions and even stronger ambitions&quot;. Haig opted for the cavalry and, after a year&apos;s training, was posted to the American occupation forces in Japan. Eighteen months into that posting he married Patricia Fox, the daughter of one of the top brass in Tokyo, General Alonzo Fox, and was then appointed the general&apos;s aide-de-camp. This brought the young lieutenant into the extraordinary military headquarters of General Douglas MacArthur, run more or less as an alternative court to Emperor Hirohito&apos;s. The experience of MacArthur&apos;s megalomania left an indelible impression on Haig. He commented later that: &quot;I was always interested in politics and started early in Japan, with a rather sophisticated view of how the military ran it.&quot; The outbreak of the Korean war also fixed his career-long belief that the communist enemy was always at the door. The initial North Korean assault in June 1950 was a disaster for US forces on the peninsula and brought home how ill-prepared MacArthur&apos;s command had become for its military role. Although Haig&apos;s unit was rushed to Korea and suffered heavy casualties, he did not go with it: instead, he was sent to accompany his father-in-law to Taiwan, on a liaison mission to Chiang Kai-shek. When he was eventually assigned to the battle zone, it was as a military assistant on the headquarters staff of an old friend of his father-in-law&apos;s, General Edward Almond. MacArthur&apos;s selection of Almond as commander of US troops preparing to land in force behind the enemy&apos;s rear was later described as &quot;an act of military nepotism&quot;. Haig&apos;s role in the highly successful Inchon landings remained obscure, but the ensuing campaign led to the first of many controversial episodes in his military advance. During the battle for Seoul, Haig was awarded a Bronze Star for bravery during a crossing of the Han River. The official citation referred to his outstanding heroism. However, the later official history of the crossing said there had been &quot;no enemy resistance&quot; and that the North Korean positions were &quot;lightly manned&quot;. Almond had recommended the decoration for his assistant and later awarded him two further Silver Stars for flying over enemy positions. Haig left Korea as a captain in 1951, suffering from hepatitis. In 1953 he was appointed to the staff of West Point as a disciplinary officer, remembered for his obsession with spit and polish, and was then assigned to a tank battalion with the American forces in Europe. He gained a routine promotion to major and, redeployed to the European Command headquarters in Germany, had his first experience of diplomacy. Congress had been grumbling about the cost of maintaining the US presence in Germany, and Haig took part in the 18-month negotiations to persuade the West Germans to shoulder more of the burden. This brought him another medal for &quot;remarkable foresight, ingenuity, and mature judgment&quot;. It also seemed to increase his taste for the administrative and political aspects of military life. In 1959 he enrolled on a military staff course and then went on to a further course at Georgetown University in Washington, where American diplomats trained. The thesis for his Georgetown master&apos;s degree showed how his ambitions were developing. It spoke of the need for a new breed of military professional occupying a prominent seat among presidential advisers. It also gave an early glimpse of his tormented prose, with incomprehensible references to &quot;interpretive vagaries&quot; and &quot;a permeating nexus&quot;. Armed with these new qualifications, Haig was assigned to a staff position at the Pentagon, where his father-in-law had become deputy to the assistant secretary for international affairs. Though Haig&apos;s own job was in military planning, his presence at the defence department, allied to his family connections, pitched him into the tangled world of Washington&apos;s cold-war politics. The Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 erupted soon after his appointment, and he later claimed that it disillusioned him with the way the doctrine of flexible response was applied. &quot;You never applied one iota of force,&quot; he commented. &quot;I was against this. It provided an incentive to the other side to up the ante.&quot; The key moment in Haig&apos;s career came in 1963 when he was picked to act as military assistant to Joe Califano, a lawyer in the army secretary&apos;s office. The army secretary was Cyrus Vance, and this period established personal and political connections from which Haig benefited for the rest of his public life. He seemed to sense that it was time to make his mark. When Vance was promoted to become deputy to the defence secretary, Robert McNamara, Califano and Haig floated up with him. Though Haig still held a relatively low-level job, he acquired considerable access both to information and to Washington&apos;s movers and shakers. But the growing US involvement in the Vietnam war made it essential that any ambitious officer become directly involved in the fighting. In 1966 Haig was made operations planning officer for the First Infantry Division, stationed near Saigon and, in a war that saw 1,273,987 medals awarded to American troops, gained a Distinguished Flying Cross within a month of his arrival. Lightly wounded in the eye when a prisoner blew himself up, Haig was involved in a number of battles in which he gained two more DFCs and 17 Air Medals. Once again, there was a conflict between some of the citations and later official accounts of the incidents. However, by the time he returned to America with the rank of colonel, in 1967, he was firmly established as a Vietnam hero. He went back to West Point to revive his reputation as a military martinet until in 1969, with Nixon the incoming president, he was recruited by the national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, to the National Security Council, recommended, as Kissinger noted in his memoirs, by Califano and McNamara. Haig, Kissinger continued, &quot;soon became indispensable ... By the end of the year [1970] I had made him formally my deputy. Over the course of Nixon&apos;s first term he acted as my partner, strong in crises, decisive in judgment, skilful in bureaucratic infighting ... [But] I could not help noticing that Haig was implacable in squeezing to the sidelines potential competitors for my attention&quot;. Among the crises in which Haig played a leading role was America&apos;s covert effort to overthrow the regime of Salvador Allende in Chile (1970-73). Haig was also cementing his relationship with Nixon and was party to one of the early manifestations of the White House&apos;s growing paranoia. In response to a number of leaks, the phones of 17 officials and journalists were tapped by the FBI. Haig helped select the candidates and, apparently aware of the doubtful legality of the operation, ordered that there should be no written record. He was also closely involved in the aftermath of the massive leak in 1971 of the secret history of the Vietnam war, the Pentagon Papers, when the White House moved illegally against the man responsible, Daniel Ellsberg. This loyalty was rewarded by promotion to major-general in 1972 and, six months later, by appointment as vice-chief of staff of the army, raising him to full general and allowing him to leapfrog 240 more senior officers. He did not, however, remain long at the Pentagon. As the revelations of the Watergate scandal began to accumulate, after the burglary of the Democratic party headquarters in Washington on 17 June 1972, Nixon was forced to sack many of the senior staff involved. On 30 April 1973, it was the turn of the White House chief of staff, HR Haldeman. The search for a successor was urgent. With the president obsessed with the scandal, the process of government was almost at a standstill. Haldeman, who had become friendly with Haig during the skirmishing over the Pentagon Papers, recommended him as an interim chief of staff, a suggestion bitterly opposed by Haig&apos;s recent boss, Kissinger. However, Kissinger could not offer an alternative, and Haig&apos;s appointment was duly announced on 4 May, to what turned out to be the most significant job of his life. Since Haig never gave a substantive account of the 15 months he spent with Nixon, it is unclear if he arrived with a definite strategy in mind. The crisis threatened to pitch the three arms of government \u2013 the presidency, the Congress and the judiciary \u2013 into unprecedented conflict. In Haig&apos;s early weeks as chief of staff, he seemed to do little more than meet each development as it came along and fend it off as best he could. The Senate hearings on the Watergate allegations had begun within two weeks of his appointment, with damaging testimony from the former White House counsel John Dean highlighting the president&apos;s direct involvement. Two months later came Alexander Butterfield&apos;s revelation of Nixon&apos;s all-embracing tape-recording system. The president&apos;s refusal to hand over the tapes and his dismissal on 20 October 1973 of Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor who tried to force the issue, clearly signalled the beginning of the end for Nixon. The day after this action, 22 bills of impeachment were introduced into Congress. On 10 October, the ineffectual vice-president, Spiro Agnew, had resigned because of bribes he had taken while governor of Maryland, and was succeeded by Ford. From being an interim appointee, Haig moved more and more centre stage as chief of staff. Though it has not been clearly documented, there is strong evidence that he became functional president. Kissinger commented that &quot;by sheer willpower, dedication, and self-discipline, he held the government together&quot;. Leon Jaworski, who eventually mounted the dozens of Watergate prosecutions, had to work closely with Haig. He wrote that he was convinced that &quot;Haig, not Nixon, was making the executive department of government function,&quot; and quoted Haig as saying: &quot;I&apos;m not trying to save the president. I&apos;m trying to save the presidency.&quot; But Jaworski also thought Haig was intent on blocking the prosecutor&apos;s efforts to uncover the conspiracy. Haig briefly stayed on at the White House under Ford and was widely believed to have played a crucial role in the decision to pardon Nixon \u2013 a misjudgment that cost Ford the 1976 election. Then Ford appointed him supreme allied commander in Europe, the top military job in Nato, from which General Andrew Goodpaster was precipitately removed to create the vacancy. Haig&apos;s arrival in December 1974 was not popular: the Dutch foreign minister called it a public relations disaster. This feeling was compounded by Haig&apos;s casual revelation, before the West German government had been consulted, that an American brigade was to be stationed in the north of the country. He also got into hot water making political speeches against Eurocommunism and telling the Italians that communist participation in their government would be &quot;unacceptable&quot;. However, he gradually toned down his rhetoric to concentrate on narrower military issues, and his popularity in Europe increased. His term was extended for a further two years in the dying days of the Ford administration, and he then found himself coping with the vagaries of President Jimmy Carter&apos;s policy on the deployment of the neutron bomb in Europe. Haig threatened to resign when Carter changed his mind about deploying the weapon, but the dust gradually settled and he was given another two-year extension. He later said that his principal achievement during his term was to secure a commitment from the 14 member governments to increase their military spending by a regular 3% a year to counter the Soviet bloc arms build-up. But he was becoming highly unpopular in Washington and was excluded from much of the debate about the Salt II strategic arms limitation agreement.     President Richard Nixon with Haig, his chief of staff, in the Oval Office of the White House in May 1974. Photograph: Rex Features    In January 1979, he announced his resignation. In June there was an attempt on his life when a bomb exploded near his car as he was travelling to the Nato HQ in Belgium. No group ever claimed responsibility. There was an assumption that he would run for the presidency, but he disclaimed any ambition at the end of the year and took over as president of United Technologies, a defence contractor. A few months later he had a double heart by-pass operation. As part of the standard wheeling and dealing of the American military-industrial world, he maintained contact with politicians of both parties, including Richard Allen, national security adviser to Reagan. Partly through this connection he was asked to speak on foreign policy at the 1980 Republican convention and then began to be tipped as a likely secretary of state. With the election of Reagan, he was duly nominated, though the two men had only spent three hours together in their lives. After leaving the state department, Haig turned to business. From 1984 onwards, he put his experience to commercial use through the &quot;strategic advice&quot; offered by his firm Worldwide Associates, and as a commentator on Fox News. He became a director of various firms, including MGM, America Online and Compuserve. Haig&apos;s principal skill \u2013 learned early in life \u2013 lay in playing the system to the full. Otherwise he was not very bright and extremely vain. If his major service was to help his country through its worst constitutional crisis, it was offset by the long-term consequences of his ill-conceived interventions in Central America. He is survived by Patricia, a daughter and two sons. \u2022 Alexander Meigs Haig, soldier, politician and businessman, born 2 December 1924; died 20 February 2010"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/feb/21/met-office-forecasts-accuracy", "publicationDate": "2010-02-21T00:35:05Z", "tags": ["Met Office", "Environment", "Weather", "Science", "Climate change", "Meteorology"], "sentences": ["Recent research suggests the stock market is far more bullish on cold days than on warm ones (a fact that holds true from Taiwan to Sweden)."], "title": "Met Office forecasts storm warnings over its accuracy", "article": "The walls of the hi-tech head-quarters of the Met Office in Exeter are decorated with wisdom about the weather. The words tend to act as a comic counterpoint to the work that goes on in the building. The meteorologists who wander the glassy corridors with one eye on the ever-changing Devon skies outside will tell you that the job of forecasting is becoming incrementally more exact with every new satellite and software update, but the walls invariably tell you something different. In the lobby, a quotation from Hansard of 1854 recalls parliament&apos;s reaction to the apparently wild suggestion of Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy that, with the appliance of scientific study, &quot;we might know in this metropolis the condition of the weather 24 hours beforehand&quot;: uproarious laughter. As I am being led through some of the rigorous logic of the current mapping systems by the heirs to FitzRoy (the manic-depressive commander of Darwin&apos;s Beagle), I can&apos;t help glancing over their shoulders to a quotation from Paul C\u00e9zanne: &quot;We live in a rainbow of chaos.&quot; Perhaps because it remains a part of the Ministry of Defence (albeit a pretty much self-sufficient part), the Met Office borrows some of the language of the military (&quot;warm fronts&quot; and &quot;cold fronts&quot; were coined during the First World War, when such waves of offence were much on meteorologists&apos; minds). This mindset is useful because, from the outside at least, the Met Office can seem almost permanently embattled. When meteorologists are not engaged with the elements, they are traditionally in conflict with the great British press (or, on occasion, with each other). One of the few things that any British weather forecaster can predict with absolute certainty is the round of headlines that will accompany any forecast that goes awry. This winter they have seen something of a perfect storm of such coverage. Following on from its &quot;odds on&quot; suggestion that 2009 would be a barbecue summer, the Met Office suggested back in October that we were likely to be due for an unusually mild winter. January&apos;s record-breaking Big Freeze, which, as it actually unfolded, the Met Office got pretty much spot on, nevertheless became another opportunity to blame the forecasters for the vagaries of the weather. The Sun, a title that loves a tale of meteorological meltdown, offered its readers a weather dart board in the belief it might do a better job than the Met Office&apos;s new supercomputer. Elsewhere the mild-winter forecast and the Great British Blizzard were tenuously linked by sceptics with the failures of the Copenhagen summit and the leaked emails from the Climate Research Unit at East Anglia (a Met Office partner) to suggest the Met Office was so preoccupied with potential warming in 50 years&apos; time that it had lost sight of next week&apos;s wind chill. This cycle of stories gathered pace and deepened when it was revealed that the BBC, another institution experiencing some ongoing turbulence, had made the decision to put the contract for its weather broadcasting, which the Met Office has held for 90 years, out to tender, with whispers that the New Zealand-based service Metra is being considered to replace the current provider. All in all, it has been the most unsettled couple of months in the institution&apos;s history since Michael Fish&apos;s hurricane in 1987, and the Bill Giles bullying scandal which followed close behind (after allegations by weather forecasters of a climate of fear that existed beyond the Velcro clouds \u2013 allegations that were overturned on appeal). If Rob Varley, the recently appointed director of forecasting, feels himself to be in the eye of this storm, then he doesn&apos;t show it. Varley was born to this job. His father was a forecaster with the Met Office for 34 years, and he has already put in nearly three decades himself. He has overall responsibility for getting the weather right for a range of clients that includes half the world&apos;s commercial aviation and the military in Afghanistan, as well as commuters on the M6 and schoolboys hoping their match won&apos;t be called off, and he is impressively sanguine about the task. His ultimate responsibility, he suggests, is winning the daily struggle to make perfect sense of a vast global atmosphere of swirling fluid. &quot;If you went up to Dartmoor,&quot; he says, &quot;and you dropped a small stick in the River Dart at Dartmeed and you drove to Newbridge, 10 miles down the road, and waited for the stick to arrive, and then had a go at predicting precisely where along the bridge the stick would pass through, bearing in mind all the factors and currents and obstacles that might affect it on the way, that is about what we are trying to do every hour\u2026&quot; Meteorologists, as every weatherman&apos;s favourite joke goes, do it with models. To aid in the understanding of this wantonly fluid system \u2013 Edward Lorenz proved chaos theory using infinitesimal modifications to weather systems \u2013 the Met Office is now equipped not only with 1,800 staff but a \u00a333m IBM computer that can make 1,000,000,000,000,000 calculations a second, through code that enables it to project weather systems forward in time an hour, a day, a week, a month, a year and a century \u2013 and all places in between. At any one point \u2013 though the central problem with the weather is that it does not have a beginning or an end, it is all middle \u2013 several dozen potential weather scenarios will be running through this endlessly refined programme, each one based on the incoming minute-by-minute data from thousands of weather stations across the globe, supplemented with observations from aircraft and radar and weather balloons and anchored vessels in the oceans, all set against a framework of patterns from orbiting satellites in the heavens. And even then, as Varley concedes, no one alive can tell you absolutely for certain whether you&apos;ll need an umbrella if you go out at lunchtime. One result of this is that criticism, like that which has come the Met Office&apos;s way recently, goes with the territory. &quot;When you get a foot of snow in one place overnight there will inevitably be disruption. That&apos;s just life. But of course it&apos;s frustrating and we want to blame someone for it. We are an easy target.&quot; The long-range forecasts, of barbecue summers and mild winters, were unfortunate, but Varley stresses, &quot;for most people, we try to make it clear there is no usefulness whatsoever in those forecasts. If I&apos;m booking a holiday, I would love to know whether June will be warmer than August, but the seasonal forecast will not tell you.&quot; So why do them? &quot;If you look over a number of years, roughly two times out of three the thing we say most likely turns out to be right,&quot; he says, &quot;so it is better than chance \u2013 and in some industries that margin is crucial.&quot; He would much rather the forecasts never made it into the press, however, &quot;but the information is out there, so what can you do?&quot; Varley doesn&apos;t believe, though, that negative publicity has contributed to the BBC&apos;s decision to consider their relationship. &quot;The BBC reviews its contracts from time to time, and rightly so,&quot; he says. &quot;The point is, we don&apos;t want to be delivering services out of some obligation, but because people know we are the best at it in the world.&quot; What really annoys Varley is the suggestion that because of the seasonal forecasts there were &quot;some aspersions about the quality of our climate science&quot; \u2013 the &quot;If they can&apos;t tell what it&apos;s going to be like this winter, how do they know what it will be like in 2050?&quot; argument, which ignores the fact that long-term temperature trends and knowledge about the effects of CO2 in the atmosphere are much more reliable than multifaceted local weather systems. The Hadley Centre, the Climate Change wing of the Met Office which was established by Margaret Thatcher 20 years ago, was recently deemed in an independent study to be the most reliable of 43,500 geoscience institutes around the world. &quot;You don&apos;t get to that position by being imprecise,&quot; Varley says, precisely. &quot;The fact is, the things we are trying to do are very difficult. Our reputation around the world is second to none, and yet in the UK we are all too often a target for criticism. That is so painful to us.&quot; It is perhaps inevitable that we should require the bringers of our weather news to suffer for their science: we need them to share our pain. There is a good deal of evidence to suggest that all of our behaviour is intimately linked to small shifts in the weather. Recent research suggests the stock market is far more bullish on cold days than on warm ones (a fact that holds true from Taiwan to Sweden). Our moods come and go like scattered showers. I was moving house from one end of the M4 to the other in the week of January&apos;s heavy snow, watching the hour-by-hour forecast unfold with the zeal of an entrail-gazing druid, now clicking on snowflake icons, now desperately shovelling grit on to the road as a hopeless offering, now stopping to thrill at the view. The BBC understands this love-hate obsession like nothing else. It persists in calming us to sleep on our damp island with the Forties Cromarty Rockall lullaby of the shipping forecast; offering the comfort of far-off storm warnings. On the night of the winter&apos;s heaviest snow, the corporation&apos;s reporters were predictably sent en masse to survey the nation&apos;s drifts in their North Face jackets and their Berghaus hats in order to say nothing at all \u2013 just so we could see them being snowed on for once in the land of dull drizzle and patchy cloud. The ritual \u2013 like the belittling of forecasters \u2013 is part of the nation&apos;s idea of itself. The uncertainty of our weather engenders both a need to know what comes next and a deep-seated anxiety that we will never know, not exactly; it is in this gap that the Met Office lives. In recent years our obsessive weather watching has taken on a medieval, apocalyptic tone as each extreme-weather event seems a portent, and all of them at least partly our fault. The weather has become personal. As Martin Amis pointed out in an interview earlier this month: &quot;Don&apos;t you sense the incredible potential for violence in the weather, already \u2014 the storms, the snow? You can see the nature of what the future will be, and it&apos;s all terror and boredom all over again. You will be massively inconvenienced and appalled by the power of the weather\u2026&quot; Well, maybe, you might say. The institution of the Met Office is a strangely seductive idea precisely because it is a physical dramatisation both of our knowledge of the unpredictability of the future and our stubborn efforts to make it known. It attempts, in a somewhat heroic way (from its earliest incarnation as a lifesaver for seamen), to bureaucratise chaos, to systematise doubt, and it sometimes comes close to doing so. It not only shows us on a weekly basis the limits of science, but also the human need for the ingenuity to overcome these limits. It is not an exact discipline but it is certainly an exacting one. Anyone who believes that dis-crepancies in climate models are down to some arcane global conspiracy should, for example, meet Stuart Goldstraw, observations manager at the Met Office, and have him explain with diehard enthusiasm the extraordinary lengths he explores in order to eliminate error from global weather statistics. Goldstraw outlines at length the detail of this endeavour to me, standing on a small hillside behind the looming Met Office building, among measuring instruments old and new. On the one hand, massive dishes stand alert for satellite information from the upper atmosphere; on the other are thermometers and rain gauges in louvred boxes. Collecting weather data, which for more than a century was a resolutely human enterprise, has lately become almost wholly mechanised, and the shift is his biggest headache. How do you create machines that can exactly replicate the human eye? Which can see fog in a valley or judge visibility? You can&apos;t \u2013 but the important thing is to know exactly where the limitations lie and to weight the information accordingly. Goldstraw points me toward a &quot;present weather centre&quot; which sends an infra-red beam out between two arms and examines what interrupts that beam. The machine is confident when it comes to snow or drizzle or rain, but sleet is beyond it. &quot;In that case it will say &apos;precipitation of an unknown type&apos;,&quot; he says, &quot;and that&apos;s when the forecasters have to guess the uncertain boundaries between snow and rain and the no man&apos;s land of sleet.&quot; Temperature, which can be influenced by all sorts of local factors \u2013 from urban creep to flaking paint on instrument boxes \u2013 is often even harder to ascertain. &quot;Climate with a capital C is our big challenge,&quot; Goldstraw concedes. For comparative purposes the climatologist is looking for accuracy to at least 0.1 of a degree, and any error in the way data is collected totally undermines that. &quot;It&apos;s only the very best,&quot; Goldstraw suggests, somewhat despairingly, &quot;that can meet that challenge over a long period.&quot; That means out of 12,000 global sites producing weather data they &quot;can generally trust only 500, and the subset of those we absolutely rely on is much reduced again, and sites drop out even of that group; it is a continual, daily battle, and then there are gaps \u2013 particularly in Africa, where we don&apos;t have much reliable data at all&quot;. If Stuart Goldstraw is the pragmatist of this process, then the blue-sky thinker is Brian Golding, head of research, who takes all that data and runs it through the model that describes chaos. Golding takes me down to the basement level of the Met Office building, where the supercomputer, in its grey rows of tombstone cabinets, hums to itself. Golding has been developing this model for 37 years. He is a meteorologist who can do maths, rather than vice versa, he says, so it is a practical model, the only integrated one of its kind, by which he means it can be used to study not only what will happen in half an hour, but also, by asking it very different questions, what will happen in 50 years&apos; time. Golding is a spirited, focused man, and his work has focused the understanding of what occurs in the swirls of air approaching our island. When he started out, the reference points on the UK&apos;s mapping grid were spaced at 100km; in the 1980s Golding led the team to a global first, a grid length of 15km; he has just implemented the third generation of this, which is a 1.5km model for the whole of the country. The effect of this, he suggests, should eventually be a fineness and accuracy of information about what will almost certainly be the increasing wetness of Britain: &quot;If you look at how we did in the Cumbrian floods [in 2009], the forecasts were brilliant, but they were still at the scale of Cumbria. With the 1.5km scale model we could come down to individual river catchments, which means you could accurately predict the height a river will rise to \u2013 which might have meant the bridge the poor policeman [PC Bill Barker] was standing on was closed before it collapsed.&quot; The weather forecast might soon, he says, be able to move from the level of depressions and fronts to very local squalls and thunderstorms, to say whether it is going to rain over this hill or that one, but that is a whole new strata of unpredictability. &quot;Mostly,&quot; Golding says, brightly, explaining his life&apos;s work, &quot;you have a fairly predictable uncertainty up to some point, and then you get to an unpredictable event, and there is a dividing of possibility and then there are two groups of solutions and then one or both of those will divide into more. And typically, chaos happens with these multiple bifurcations.&quot; Generally this first splitting of possibility happens after two or three days. And after that, it will always be trickier to know. It is somehow gratifying to know that despite all this computer power, the forecasts we hear still come down to a bloke sitting in front of a map and wondering whether on this occasion the model&apos;s billions of calculations have really got it exactly right. All of the data collection and exponential number crunching eventually ends up in front of the chief forecaster, who, on this day, is a man called Frank Saunders, who is staring at a screen in the middle of the operations room \u2013 from which half the world&apos;s weather is forecast, from which aircraft are grounded and gritters dispatched \u2013 and looking vaguely alarmed. When I visit the Met Office in the first week of February, there is some snow around in the north of England, but the temperature is hovering around freezing point, so trying to work out where it is falling is an informed guessing game. Saunders is trying to work out exactly how Manchester is going to receive the &quot;unknown precipitation event&quot; while keeping an eye on storm surges around the coast and the changing information about overnight ice. &quot;My intuition,&quot; he says, &quot;suggests it is being slightly overdone in the observations and it will fall as rain.&quot; Get that intuition wrong, though, and what falls as a centimetre of rain will work out to 10cm of snow, the difference between drizzle and gridlock. It is Saunders&apos;s job to convey the nuance of this message to all the nation&apos;s broadcasters in an hourly conference-call briefing. For all the science, if he gets the emphasis wrong, or a word out of place, sunshine can quickly become showers. The chief forecaster is not for nothing known as God. As Saunders prepares for his briefing he accidentally knocks a cup of water over his desk, and I wonder for a moment how the subliminal stress of that particular precipitation event will play out in the nation&apos;s skies. Einstein once observed: &quot;Before I die, I hope someone will clarify quantum physics for me. After I die, I hope God will explain turbulence to me.&quot; An explanation for turbulence is what we have come to expect, though, and we have little patience when our prophets fail us. In an effort to deflect criticism when what falls from the air does not match what we have been told to prepare for, the Met Office is planning to introduce a more &quot;probabilistic&quot; element to forecasting, offering you percentage chances rather than a definitive symbol of cloud or rain. One of the elements of their ongoing contract discussions with the BBC is how this can best be done. Almost uniformly the people I speak to at the Met Office believe the probabilistic method will finally allow them to convey the subtleties of the systems they are describing, the probabilistic will allow them to be right nearly all the time, the probabilistic will prevent the forecast coming back to bite them. I hesitate to point out that in America, where this style has long been employed, it was recently shown that only 50% of people understood what a 30% chance of rain actually meant and were therefore more likely to take their umbrella on the off-chance than ever before. As the man said, there is never any such thing as bad weather, just the wrong clothes. When they got it wrong August 2004 The Cornish village of Boscastle was deluged with more than a month&apos;s rain in seven hours. The medium-term forecast had been a modest 30-50mm of rainfall, but 133mm fell between 11am and 6pm. As villagers paddled down the streets, the Met Office declared: &quot;No one could have forecast 133mm in seven hours. This was a freak event.&quot; May 2009 Bournemouth tourism officials were furious about a bank holiday forecast that predicted pouring rain and thunderstorms for the southeast. Town traders claimed they lost 25,000 would-be visitors \u2013 who would have basked in 22C sunshine. June 2001 In May the Met Office was spreading joy \u2013 it was going to be a long hot summer. Three months later Scotland was in the grip of horrendous electrical storms: 9,000 homes without electricity, hailstones the size of golf balls, transport chaos and, horror of horrors, 500,000 viewers left without TV for more than three hours when lightning struck a major television transmitter. When they got it right December 2004 A bad winter for the bookies \u2013 but a good winter for the Met Office. Scotland enjoyed its first official white Christmas in three years and bookies cried into their porridge. The Met Office had predicted that &quot;much of Scotland, Northern Ireland, northwest England and Wales are likely to see a white Christmas&quot;. June 1997 As Pete Sampras limbered up for his fourth Wimbledon title, Britain was on course for the wettest June in six years. While fans dreaded the inevitable Cliff Richard (right) sing-alongs, the Met Office had a spring in its step: &quot;We forecast showers for 30 days, and we were right for 22 of them.&quot; January 1990 Forty-seven people died in the Burns Day Storm, when 104mph winds uprooted 3m trees, buildings collapsed, and the damage cost insurers \u00a33.37bn. Unlike the infamous hurricane of &apos;87, however, the Met Office had given plenty of warning \u2013 four days before the storm hit, severe gale warnings were issued on TV."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/feb/23/gordon-brown-bullying", "publicationDate": "2010-02-23T13:50:05Z", "tags": ["Gordon Brown", "Politics", "UK news", "Bullying", "Society"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s Apple Daily has again chosen to get round the problem of there being no actual footage of alleged incidents in the news with a spot of computer-generated imagery.", "Here&apos;s an explanation of why the post says Taiwan: Apple Daily operates in both Hong Kong and Taiwan, with websites and newspapers for each market.", "But its CGI department, which animated the scenes above, is based in Taiwan - Apple Daily, or rather its Next Media Animation arm, has confirmed the Brown CGI work was done in Taiwan.", "For more on Apple Daily&apos;s animations, a recent piece from CNN visits the studios and reports on the 180-strong staff and some of the ire its activities have attracted from the Taiwanese authorities."], "title": "Gordon Brown bullying claims, the CGI version", "article": "First Tiger Woods, now Gordon Brown.

Founded in November, Next Media Animation&apos;s YouTube channel offers more than 1,000 videos, some of them focusing on western news such as the bullying allegations against Brown or the recent killer whale attack in Sea World in Florida.  But the new style faces a lot of opposition. Taiwan&apos;s National Communications Commission recently rejected Lai&apos;s application for a television licence, citing the salacious nature of the animations, according to CNN.

There was a bar on Palmyra Atoll, south west of Hawaii (population: 8); there was a bar on Willis Island in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland (population: 4). Ten minutes after he and I have arrived in Heligoland (population: a few hundred frozen Germans, and us) we are, therefore, sitting in a one-roomed pub, advertised by a gigantic wooden herring outside, and crammed inside with Dutch and German and English nautical knick-knackery. It is midday, and we have been on the road for four hours: first by car from Hamburg through fog and a blizzard to an airstrip at Uetersen. Then by eight-seater plane, which took off in a perturbing foot of snow, to an island called Dune. Then by roiling ferry across to here, Heligoland, holy land. It feels something like a pilgrimage for the insane and the desperate, and Veley, a neatly groomed, 44-year-old American, has been on the lookout for signs and wonders. &quot;This is part of my style,&quot; he tells me, gesturing around the bar. &quot;Heligoland: I had no idea about it. So when we got here I waited for something. I saw this piece of paper in the window saying Eiergrog \u2013 &quot;Egg grog&quot; \u2013 and it looked interesting, so I walked past the big wooden fish and came in. My philosophy for travel is this: always plan as if you are going to do a Japanese-style tour and every second is accounted for. But on arrival, abandon all that and do whatever feels right. Eiergrog felt right. And you walk in, there is a pretty girl behind the bar, and you start to understand the place.&quot; Iris, the pretty girl, has just placed two Eiergrogs on the table in front of us: hot, rum-based, raw-egg drinks whisked into a froth. Iris came here six years ago to do a seasonal job from Berlin, met a man, and stayed. &quot;It is,&quot; she says, nodding at the swirling snow outside, the boarded-up beach huts and shop fronts, &quot;better in summer.&quot; She has now met another man and plans to follow him to Australia. There is one other drinker in the bar, an 87-year-old named Herr Westerhaus, sipping glasses of hot gin. He has a daughter in East Anglia and was, he says, a radio signaller here for U-boats during the war. He had so many good memories he came back when he retired. Veley, who slips easily in and out of German, has stories for both Iris and Herr Westerhaus; he has been to all the places they have been. In fact, as it quickly becomes apparent, he has been to all the places anyone has been. Heligoland is number 806 on Veley&apos;s list of visited &quot;countries&quot;. He ticked off all the 193 UN-recognised nations eight years ago, and since then he has been collecting islands and atolls, provinces and protectorates. These days he runs a website called Most Traveled People, which has 8,000 members, mostly, like him, &quot;competitive travellers&quot;, trading stories about Mizoram, Kingman Reef and Rio Muni. He established it, he suggests, in an attempt to bring some rigour to these travellers&apos; tales, to rationalise the globe&apos;s possibilities (and, you imagine, to advertise his own unprecedented wanderlust). It hasn&apos;t, he concedes, always worked out like that. The world of competitive travelling is, well, nothing if not competitive. For a start, deciding what is and what isn&apos;t a separate &quot;country&quot; \u2013 &quot;a discrete geographical, ethnological or political entity&quot; \u2013 threatens to become almost a full-time job in itself. Border disputes are rife. &quot;People put forward nominations and I collect those,&quot; he says. &quot;And whatever has the most nominations becomes a candidate, and then there is a voting process. Spain and France and Italy and several others are now divided into semi-autonomous regions. So it&apos;s getting tougher\u2026&quot; He doubts anyone, not even himself, will ever get the whole list (which currently stands at 871). &quot;We are always adding new places. And there are already some really difficult places out there. Like Scott Island, a New Zealand island toward Antarctica; only six people have ever landed on it.&quot; He says this with a certain frustration. Beyond the attempt to quantify all the world&apos;s remotest corners, there are also ongoing qualitative arguments, mostly about what is meant by the word &quot;visit&quot;. Some travellers claim you must spend a night in a place; some argue it is enough to visit a lavatory there; &quot;others,&quot; Veley suggests, somewhat wearily, &quot;will say you have to sleep on a park bench or do it for less than $10 to make it real. And some people believe you must have cocktails at Annabelle&apos;s or wherever\u2026&quot; Veley has attempted to bring some order to this area, too. Just touching down while on a plane is not enough; Most Traveled People requires a photograph or a passport stamp or a credit card receipt. He recently, he says, personally defined the minimum requirements of what constitutes a &quot;landing&quot; on the North Sea island of Rockall (of shipping forecast fame). He&apos;d had a go at Rockall once before, with his friend, the clubbable castaway Ben Fogle, but the weather had been too tricky and they had turned their sailboat back. This time, with a different group, he set off from Benbecula, and it was beautiful, calm sailing for two days. When they got to Rockall, however, even in those perfect conditions, it was not clear exactly how they might land. &quot;The swell is 7 metres, maybe,&quot; Veley recalls, &quot;and the rock has sheer sides all round with powerful eddies beneath them.&quot; Veley and his fellow travellers circled the rock for half a day, waiting for a change in the sea. &quot;We eventually decided to have a go at one corner that was a bit more craggy and had a skirt of thick kelp attached to it,&quot; he says. Among the crew was a photographer from Stornoway, who donned a wetsuit and jumped on a surfboard. &quot;He timed the swell, grabbed the kelp, found the crag and hauled himself up,&quot; Veley says, &quot;and we were all cheering wildly.&quot; Then it was Veley&apos;s turn. It took him ages to get the wetsuit on. The swell seemed even wilder. He plunged in. &quot;I found the kelp, timed the surge, grabbed the crag, stood up on Rockall for maybe one and a half seconds before the next wave crashed over and knocked me straight back into the sea. But that counts, for sure\u2026&quot; We order two more Eiergrogs. Charles Veley grew up in Brooklyn and never left the United States until he was 18. His parents split up when he was young; money was tight and didn&apos;t extend to foreign holidays. Veley recalls sitting as a boy in the driver&apos;s seat of his father&apos;s car with the Rand McNally map on his knees, planning trips from coast to coast in his head, imagining himself always on the open road. His first attempts at escape came when he was sponsored through his computer science degree at Harvard by the Officer Training Corps of the US Air Force; this was the era of Top Gun and competition for places was intense. Veley topped his year as a trainee fighter pilot before being abruptly dropped from the programme when a routine medical discovered a minute scar on his retina. By that time he was pulling jets out of tailspins and imagining 10 years stationed in remote air bases. He responded to the disappointment by taking a flight over to the UK to see some friends at Cambridge, and from there his addiction to travel began. He took a Eurail pass and was hooked by the possibility. The last time he was in this part of Germany he got off at Hamburg train station and went running round town trying to eat a hamburger. &quot;I had never left the States and suddenly there were borders, passport stamps...&quot; Romance was a part of it, the prospect of unexpected encounters. &quot;I had a three-week coach pass around Britain, too,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I really wanted to go to Dorset because I loved Thomas Hardy, and I wanted to go to Scotland. I remember being in this overnight coach from Birmingham up to the Highlands and there was this redheaded girl sitting next to me. And I remember sort of in the middle of the night we were snogging suddenly. I had a lot of interesting seat mates on coaches.&quot; When he returned to the States, Veley joined with some friends in setting up a dot.com company creating software that delivered business intelligence, helping retailers to understand the buying patterns of consumers. He worked 100-hour weeks and managed some long-haul travel when he could. In 1999 the company, MicroStrategy, floated on the ballooning Nasdaq and the share price peaked at $333. Veley had 500,000 shares. He was about to get married, he was 35, and he decided to retire. &quot;I&apos;d always had a goal to speak five languages,&quot; he says. &quot;I was studying French, German and Italian at night school, and then I thought: why do this? Why not go and live in these places instead? So my wife Kimberly and I went and did a year abroad \u2013 this was 2000. We got two round-the-world tickets and we lived in France and then Germany and then we went down to South Africa, and the geography down there just blew my mind. I realised we could go to Malawi, Botswana. And then we took another year and went to South America. And then I learned about the Travelers&apos; Century Club, which has an entry level of 100 countries.&quot; At the same time he was getting more and more interested in round-the-world tickets. &quot;If you really get into the mechanics of them,&quot; he says, &quot;you can fly first or business and pay much less than economy, and that appealed to the computer side of me, puzzling over algorithms.&quot; Along the way, while he was in Tasmania, Veley discovered by turning on the TV that he was no longer a multimillionaire: the MicroStrategy share price had crashed to 40 cents, but he was too far gone in his travelling to turn back. He figured the shares would bounce back. He booked some more flights. It was when he and his wife were on the way to Hong Kong from Korea and he became excited when he realised they could stop in Taiwan for four hours that he knew he was hooked. For a few years after that Veley averaged around 100 countries per year. Some trips were more efficient than others. He flew to the South Pole in 2003 and took in Argentinian, Australian, British, Chilean, French, New Zealand and Norwegian territories without leaving the same spot \u2013 all countries disputing a single patch of land. The share price did rally somewhat, and he spent, he reckons, more than $1m on plane tickets and freighter passages and sailboat charters: 1m miles of travel in just three years, which took in every place you could name, and plenty you couldn&apos;t: Malyj Vysotskij Island, Zil Elwannyen Sesel, Ogasawara. For much of that time, Veley&apos;s wife accompanied him, clocking up 200 countries herself, but in 2004 they had their first child, and now they have three, aged six, four and two, all autumn births because the Antarctic exploration season ends in February, and by that time Veley had generally been away from home for more than three months. He insists that since his children have been born family has been his priority, but he still pursues his impossible itinerary. When we meet he is midway through a 16-stop round-the-world ticket, en route home for a week in San Francisco to catch the end of Valentine&apos;s Day and take the children off to Disneyland. Then he has a province of Argentina to collect. Veley is telling me all of this while we wander somewhat aimlessly in the sleet and knifing cold, fortified by Eiergrog, up to the high point of Heligoland, past a stark geometric church to a headland spiked with radio masts and overlooking rock stacks washed by the ocean. He takes it all in without too much comment. He doesn&apos;t collect souvenirs, or take photos beyond the odd snap on his iPhone, or jot down notes. Never does. I&apos;m intrigued, of course, by his motivation, but he can&apos;t explain the obsession much except in the blandest terms \u2013 proof positive that you are either a psychologist or an adventurer, but rarely both. &quot;If you want to have a complete worldview you have to go everywhere,&quot; he&apos;ll say. &quot;Every place you learn something new.&quot; Or: &quot;It&apos;s an investment in life experience. Whenever I meet anyone, no matter where they are from, I can always relate to them.&quot; Or: &quot;While I&apos;m alive I just want to see as much of the world as I can. I&apos;m organised; I have a computer background.&quot; When I mention the environmental impact of his travels, he brushes the question aside. &quot;I care about the environment just like you,&quot; he says. The challenge itself is sometimes enough of a motivation. Palmyra Atoll (population: 8; bars: 1) is maintained by Nature Conservancy in the US. In his enquiries about how he might get there, Veley was referred to a woman named Nancy at the Conservancy offices in Vermont. She suggested to him that the only people who ever got to go to Palmyra Atoll were those who made at least a &quot;six-figure contribution to Nature Conservancy&quot;. To Veley this was fighting talk. &quot;I can be quite persistent,&quot; he says, on deserted Heligoland, with a degree of understatement. In the end he chartered a boat out of Hawaii with a few others to share the cost. &quot;We finally arrived at Palmyra some days later,&quot; he recalls. &quot;The bar is a run-down wooden structure built 30 years ago and yachties had written stuff on the walls. I wrote a &apos;Poem to Nancy&apos;: &apos;Palmyra is nice/great palm trees and sand/please lower the price/from one hundred grand\u2026&apos;&quot; It seems almost redundant to ask Veley about his favourite places, though from time to time \u2013 he has a weirdly accurate memory for names and events \u2013 he will suggest how he had a fine time on St Kilda, or he&apos;ll let slip that everyone loves country and western music on Pitcairn. The strangest place he&apos;s ever been was the &quot;conference room&quot; between North and South Korea, in Panmunjom, two nations staring at each other. The scariest: Afghanistan on the first anniversary of 9/11. He once made a list of all the worst things that had happened to him: the time a tree frog urinated on his forehead in Tortuguero, or when his canoe capsized in the Zambezi, among hippos, or when he waited for three days for a boat out of Christmas Island, and when it arrived he went to introduce himself to the captain before their 1,000-mile voyage only to discover him drunk, stoned, naked and masturbating in his cabin. The urge to travel to Veley&apos;s extent, a kind of attention deficit on a global scale, has a medical diagnosis: dromomania, the addiction to new experiences, the vagabond neurosis. He&apos;s a curious case, though. While most dromomaniacs are permanently wedded to the road, Veley is both rooted and adrift, very settled, he insists, and almost permanently travelling. His rivals \u2013 nearly all of them acquaintances \u2013 have sometimes claimed that what Veley does is not really travel at all: it&apos;s too systematic, there&apos;s no depth to it, not enough danger. He became friendly with John Clouse, who for many years was the Guinness world record holder as the most travelled man (before Guinness decided to abandon the category, as there were too many conflicting criteria). Clouse, a lawyer from Indiana, went through six marriages before his death two years ago at 82. &quot;He tended to find a new wife and travel with her, and then she would realise what was involved,&quot; Veley explains. About three-quarters of the travellers on his website are men, though the &quot;leaderboard&quot; used to include a woman who claimed all sorts of incredible journeys. She had claimed, for example, that she had been to Mount Athos, the Greek monastic state into which only males are allowed, arguing that when she was a girl her father had cut her hair short and taken her in. Veley asked for proof of some of her exploits and she immediately removed herself. The table currently shows a man named Bill Altaffer slightly ahead of Veley, but though Veley doesn&apos;t doubt Altaffer&apos;s &quot;been all over the place&quot; he suggests that Altaffer refuses to always provide the evidence required, and that their paths don&apos;t cross too often, and &quot;it is, I guess,&quot; Veley says, &quot;not worth worrying too much about&quot;. One of the things that his years of waiting for planes and boats has taught him is that, try as you might, you can&apos;t force situations. &quot;I remember on my initial Euro trip it was late afternoon and I was in Rome and I couldn&apos;t go in the Vatican because I was wearing shorts. I remember thinking: this is the only chance I will ever have. I was wrong.&quot; The first time he tried to get to the North Pole on an icebreaker from Svalbard they got stuck in the ice at 86 and a quarter degrees latitude. He went back the next year and made it. &quot;Things will come round again&quot; is his mantra. His only assets, he suggests \u2013 beyond, that is, his financial resources \u2013 are patience and politeness in negotiating the world&apos;s officialdom. To that I would add a certain sure sense of restlessness, of giving the impression of being on the way somewhere else, of nowhere being a final destination. On the boat back to the airstrip on Dune we find ourselves in the cabin of the Heligoland ferry with half a dozen German men in their sixties, who appear to have been at the Eiergrog all day. Discovering we speak English they launch into a rousing version of &quot;What Shall We Do with the Drunken Sailor&quot; as the small boat pitches across the bay. They come here every year, one of the more sober members of the group explains to me as we approach the airstrip. Have been doing so for 40 years, always this weekend in February, always this place. &quot;Nothing changes. Friends, the same. Heligoland, the same. That&apos;s how we like it,&quot; he says. Charles Veley joins in with the singing, files away the experience neatly, but I&apos;m guessing he is also planning what to do later in Hamburg, and thinking about tomorrow morning&apos;s flight, and the one after, and the one after that. Novelty can have its own monotony, too.

Mounted on trucks, pointing skywards, and electronically linked to six naval destroyers equipped with Aegis phased array radar, they mark the Japan Self-Defence Force&apos;s first foray into BMD. The full deployment will be completed this year. This is the type of defensive missile system the Obama administration plans to introduce in eastern Europe. It is similar to the missiles the US has controversially agreed to sell to Taiwan, to counter the growing threat from China. Under its postwar constitution, Japan renounced &quot;for ever&quot; the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. But the 1960 US-Japan security treaty made clear that Tokyo has a right to self-defence. Since then, and with accelerating speed since the 9/11 attacks, Japan&apos;s defence and security activities have expanded. While still essentially defensive in nature, they include international peacekeeping operations, logistical and financial support in Afghanistan, emphasis on strengthened regional alliances, overseas disaster relief, anti-piracy operations and a proactive overseas development programme. Defence ministry officials and analysts in Tokyo suggest three factors are driving this evolution. One is a host of regional threats and potential flashpoints. They include territorial disputes with China, Russia and South Korea; China&apos;s rapid military build-up; its aggressive oil exploration in the East China Sea; and North Korea&apos;s unpredictable behaviour. &quot;The environment that we face is harsh and difficult and this is making us feel that we may have to be more self-reliant,&quot; said a senior defence ministry official. &quot;On the other hand, this makes it all the more important to solidify our alliance with the US.&quot; The second factor fuelling Japanese insecurity, however, is growing doubt about that very alliance. A simmering row over relocating the Futenma US Marine Corps base in Okinawa, US troop drawdowns in east Asia, revived concerns about the dependability of the US &quot;nuclear umbrella&quot; and the general perception that US global predominance is weakening in the new &quot;Chinese century&quot; all suggest Japan must do more to look after itself. This thinking is reflected, thirdly, in Japan&apos;s domestic politics, still in flux after last autumn&apos;s watershed defeat of the conservative Liberal Democrats, in power almost continuously since the war, by the centre-left Democratic party. Prime minister Yukio Hatoyama&apos;s emphasis on east Asian communal &quot;fraternity&quot; and a &quot;more equal&quot;, balanced relationship with the US has put noses out of joint in Washington but appears to have struck a chord with Japanese voters. Economic difficulties are spurring un-Japanese talk of radical solutions. Such problems are for the politicians to sort out. At Iruma air base, Taniguchi sticks to the basics, and he draws an unexpected parallel. When it comes to air defence, the RAF&apos;s triumph in the Battle of Britain in 1940 is his inspiration, he says. Japan was devastated in the second world war because it could not defend itself in the air. By the look on his face, it is clear that if Taniguchi has any say in the matter, it won&apos;t happen again."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/feb/28/im-pei-architecture-interview", "publicationDate": "2010-02-28T21:30:01Z", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture"], "sentences": ["&quot;You know, the first decent \u00adbuilding I did with my own practice was a chapel in Taiwan.&quot; This was the Luce Memorial Chapel.", "From a Christian chapel in Taiwan to a Shinto temple in Japan, via some of the most impressive and \u2013 albeit unintentionally \u2013 \u00adcontroversial buildings of the past 50 years, Pei, the most \u00adunpolemical of men, has met the \u00adchallenges of \u00adarchitecture at all levels."], "title": "The Pei master", "article": "&quot;It is good to learn from the \u00adancients,&quot; says IM Pei with a smile. &quot;I&apos;m a bit of an ancient \u00admyself. They had a lot of time to think about architecture and landscape. Today, we rush \u00adeverything, but architecture is slow, and the landscapes it sits in even slower. It needs the time our political systems won&apos;t allow.&quot; Impeccably mannered and \u00adquietly spoken, Pei, now 92, has walked an \u00adarchitectural tightrope for half a \u00adcentury. Marrying ancient and modern, he has created buildings as influential as the trapezoid-shaped east wing of Washington&apos;s National Gallery of Art, as ambitious as the Bank of China&apos;s soaring HQ in Hong Kong, and as controversial as the Pyramide du \u00adLouvre in Paris. He has won pretty much every prize his profession has to offer; last month he was presented with the prestigious royal gold medal for \u00adarchitecture, a gift of the Queen, \u00adpresented by the Royal Institute for British Architects. &quot;A wonderful honour,&quot; he says, when we meet in London&apos;s Mandarin Oriental hotel, &quot;for someone who hasn&apos;t really built here.&quot; Born in Canton, south-east China, in 1917, Pei is the son of a banker and an artistic mother, who would take him to see dreamy Chinese gardens and \u00admountainside shrines. &quot;These have always been the most important \u00adinspiration to me as an architect,&quot; says Pei. &quot;I have never forgotten those gardens: wonderful marriages of \u00adman-made and natural design. I&apos;ve come back to them again and again; they are my guide as much as the work of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, who I admired as a young architect newly arrived in the US.&quot; Despite being offered a place at \u00adOxford, the lure of America proved too strong for the young Pei. &quot;I liked the America of Bing Crosby, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton \u2013 it was all a dream, of course, but a very alluring dream for a young man from Canton.&quot; It drew him to San Francisco, and from there to a string of east coast universities, where he studied under Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. His intention had been to return to China, but war broke out and he stayed on to become a US \u00adcitizen, setting up his own practice in\u00a01960. A rose-red vision in the Rockies Pei&apos;s reputation was made with the opening, in 1967, of his bold laboratories for the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Colorado. Clad in local stone that goes from pink to rose-red to ruddy brown with the passing sun, these geometric labs look and feel like an extension of the Rocky Mountains; yet they are defiantly man-made, right down to the slits and chutes cut into their walls. &quot;When I first came to this awe-\u00adinspiring landscape,&quot; says Pei, &quot;it was as if I was standing with my mother again, on a sacred mountainside in China.&quot; This being Colorado, though, he looked for inspiration locally. &quot;I\u00a0\u00advisited the nearby Indian pueblos,&quot; he says, referring to the 13th-century Native American cliff dwellings, &quot;and absorbed their forms and structure.&quot; Pei was 50 when the labs opened; architecture, as he says, shouldn&apos;t be hurried. &quot;As a young man, of course I had been looking for something new, even revolutionary. I knew what Le Corbusier was doing. I wanted to go his way. But, after some years, I began to think differently. I became interested in a modern architecture that made connections to place, history and \u00adnature. Modern architecture needed to be part of an evolutionary, not a \u00adrevolutionary, process.&quot; The infamous Louvre pyramid Pei went from strength to strength with commissions for Washington&apos;s National Gallery of Art and the John F Kennedy Memorial Library in Boston. The former exhibits the powerful, elemental forms that characterise his mature work; the mere fact of being commissioned for the latter shows Pei&apos;s standing in his adopted country. His most charismatic work, though, was commissioned far from America. Twenty years ago, Pei unveiled two of his finest buildings: the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong, and the underground lobbies of the Louvre in Paris capped with his famous (some might say infamous) pyramid. The tower is one of the most exciting and elegant of all recent skyscrapers. Intended as a symbol of the new, ultra-capitalist People&apos;s Republic, the building was a special one for the architect. His father had worked for the Bank of China long before it was taken into state control, while Pei, educated by Christian missionaries at Shanghai&apos;s St John&apos;s Middle School, had long sided with Chinese \u00adnationalists rather than Mao&apos;s communists. Shortly before the opening of the tower, Pei wrote a powerful editorial for the New York Times condemning the \u00adTiananmen Square massacre of 1989, which he saw as a sign that the image China wanted to project to the world \u2013 partly through his cool, modern tower \u2013 was \u00addrastically out of step with the reality of life for the country&apos;s people. Yet the tower, with its beautifully expressed, zig-zagging steel frame, rises out of the density of Hong Kong with a confidence and \u00adelegance that places it above the brutal nature of \u00adpolitics. It was the island&apos;s tallest building when it opened in 1990, and it still ranks among the finest \u00adadditions to the city, a \u00admajestic peak in an urban mountain range. The Louvre pyramid stirred even deeper emotions, and huge \u00adcontroversy. Commissioned as one of President \u00adMitterrand&apos;s grands projets in 1985, this ingenious structure \u2013 at once ethereal and crystalline, ancient and \u00admodern \u2013 has slowly won over most of its \u00addetractors. The tip of an architectural iceberg, it forms the entrance to the cavernous Pei-designed lobbies below. &quot;I hoped the controversy would die down quickly,&quot; says Pei. &quot;Perhaps I was a little optimistic. But, you know, the choice of the pyramid was not some personal idiosyncrasy. Paris is a city of pyramids, from the time when \u00adNapoleon [after whom the court the pyramid rises from is named] became fascinated by Egyptian architecture, after his military campaign along the Nile.&quot; What&apos;s more, the Cour \u00adNapoleon is the urban equivalent of a desert plain. Pei&apos;s pyramid rises from it as purposefully and fittingly as its massive stone predecessors do from the sands of Giza. Today, steering well away from \u00adcontroversy, Pei is working quietly on a Shinto temple in Kyoto, close to the extraordinary Miho Museum, which sits half-buried in the rugged, misty landscape of the Shiga mountains. &quot;It will be a fusion of ancient feeling and contemporary design,&quot; he says. &quot;You know, the first decent \u00adbuilding I did with my own practice was a chapel in Taiwan.&quot; This was the Luce Memorial Chapel. Designed in 1954 and \u00adcompleted nine years later, it&apos;s a \u00adstunning, tent-like concrete structure with overlapping roofs that look like stylised leaves falling from the canopy of some sacred grove. &quot;I think I must be coming full \u00adcircle,&quot; says Pei. Perhaps he is. From a Christian chapel in Taiwan to a Shinto temple in Japan, via some of the most impressive and \u2013 albeit unintentionally \u2013 \u00adcontroversial buildings of the past 50 years, Pei, the most \u00adunpolemical of men, has met the \u00adchallenges of \u00adarchitecture at all levels. Somehow, though, I think he would still like to design a garden \u00adstudded with modern \u00adpavilions that would \u00adcomplement (he is not \u00adinterested in rivalling or \u00adbettering) the place that has so \u00adinspired him, the Taoist Lion Grove Garden in Suzhou, with its \u00adpoetically named buildings: the \u00adStanding-in-the-Snow Hall, Faint \u00adFragrance Dim Shadow Tower and True Delight \u00adPavilion. He acknowledges this by simply saying: &quot;In \u00adanother life, I might be a gardener. How wonderful it must be to design such gardens.&quot; Pei says his toughest ever \u00adcommission was the Museum of \u00adIslamic Art in \u00adQatar, which opened in 2008. How could he distil \u00adcenturies of Islamic \u00addesign into one building? He found the answer when he visited the serene, ninth-century mosque of Ahmad ibn Tulun in Cairo. Its ancient elemental forms, and its \u00adprecise use of shadows thrown by the baking sun, found a new life in Pei&apos;s hard-edged, geometrically bold \u00admuseum, set on an artificial island 60\u00a0metres off the Doha waterfront. Pei, after all, is a great believer in continuity. Married for nearly 70 years, he has four children, two of them \u00adarchitects. As we talk, he displays a huge \u00adadmiration for the \u00adlongevity of his \u00adfellow royal gold medal \u00adwinner, Oscar Niemeyer, the \u00adBrazilian designer of \u00adcities the world over. \u00ad&quot;Oscar is still a radical,&quot; he says. &quot;He&apos;s still at work, every day, at the age of 102. Wow! \u00adPerhaps I&apos;m not so \u00adancient after all.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/01/japan-defence-north-korea-china-missile", "publicationDate": "2010-03-01T13:25:19Z", "tags": ["World news", "Japan", "North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "China", "Politics", "Defence policy", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["It is also similar to the missiles the US has controversially agreed to sell to Taiwan, to help counter the growing threat from China."], "title": "Japan is ready for North Korea | Simon Tisdall", "article": "At Iruma military base in Saitama prefecture, north of Tokyo, Air Force Major Hiroshi Taniguchi is ready for anything.

It reported her as saying that her show was pushing boundaries in small but meaningful ways and giving the example that on the day a British man, Akmal Shaikh, was executed in China for drug trafficking despite assertions that he was mentally ill, the programme had discussed mental disorders. In fact she was referring to China Radio International in general at that point, not to her own show. That discussion took place on a different programme, a few weeks before Susan Osman&apos;s show began.   &apos;Susan Boyle Won&apos;t Be Joining China Radio International,&quot; ran the headline in an English- language Chinese paper, joining such disconcerting classics of the genre as &quot;Drunk Man Acts Stupid&quot; and &quot;Jennifer Aniston \u2013 Ferret Would &apos;Put Me Off&apos; In Dating&quot;. The Susan in question was actually Susan Osman, a former BBC presenter recruited by Chinese state radio and mistaken by excited internet gossips for the star of Britain&apos;s Got Talent, leading to the news story putting the record straight. Osman&apos;s move at the end of last year made waves in the UK too, but for very different reasons \u2013 she complained that as a 51-year-old woman she had hit a silver ceiling and was left with little choice but to move halfway round the world to escape a &quot;culture of ageism&quot;. Her accusations resonated because they followed other controversies such as the axing of Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips. More recently, Miriam O&apos;Reilly announced that she was suing the BBC for age and sex discrimination after she and three over-40 female colleagues were &quot;let go&quot; from Countryfile. &quot;There is an age in the UK where you are past your sell-by date,&quot; Osman says. &quot;You constantly feel you&apos;re having to apologise and not mention your age \u2013 or [the fact that] my son&apos;s 20; you can kind of date me by that.&quot; Meanwhile, she says, thinning hair and saggy faces appear to be no obstacle for men. &quot;There are some shockers,&quot; she points out. The BBC, however, says that its programmes strive for diversity. A spokesman adds: &quot;Broadcasting, especially presenting, is an extremely competitive industry and the nature of the industry is such that many broadcasters are freelance artists engaged on contracts of specific durations. Ageism has nothing to do with it.&quot; Until she snagged the CRI job Osman feared her career might be at an end, 28 years after it began by chance. (She was teaching at girls&apos; school Roedean when a television director working on a documentary there spotted her.) Ensuing jobs ranged from consumer journalism at Channel 4 to anchoring local news programmes. Most recently, she was a freelance presenter on the BBC News Channel, and then, just as opportunities seemed to be waning, her son returned from an internship in China and urged her to go east, promising they would appreciate her age. &quot;I don&apos;t think I have ever \u2013 ever \u2013 been treated with so much respect in a working environment,&quot; she says now, with faint surprise; almost all the staff on her show are men half her age. &quot;They listen, seem to admire me and seem to understand what changes I&apos;m trying to bring here.&quot; Of course she had qualms about working for the Chinese state media: &quot;I was very worried about editorial interference . . . Having come from a BBC background, objectivity and credibility are very important, as is balance. I didn&apos;t want to compromise that.&quot; So she suggested hosting a chat show rather than a news programme \u2013 which seems a good fit as she has a touch of the Judy Finnegan about her \u2013 &quot;but when I arrived it was pretty evident they needed some help&quot;. The result is the breakfast-time English-language show, Beijing Hour. In style, it sounds much like a local BBC radio show, including traffic roundups and chit-chat with the business reporter. But while a news report about the Dalai Lama avoids the kind of angry rhetoric sometimes employed by state media, it is noticeable that it also omits the viewpoint of the Tibetan government-in-exile. &quot;Well, there isn&apos;t a Tibetan government. You have to be accurate,&quot; she says. &quot;Let&apos;s be very clear: Tibet, legally, belongs to China. It always has done.&quot; Though this argument is Chinese orthodoxy, it is hotly disputed by other historians. Always, I ask? &quot;Always,&quot; she insists. &quot;It&apos;s a hugely complex subject and I think it&apos;s very dangerous to oversimplify and take sides . . . When in China, perhaps you have a different perspective from western counterparts because you have more detail. But how you can convey that detail in an accurate, balanced and fair way is the challenge.&quot; It seems odd to talk of balance when you can report only one side. &quot;I think this is a possible issue. But honestly, I have only been in this country for six weeks and I&apos;m no aficionado of the history of Tibet and China, and I don&apos;t really think it&apos;s my place to comment on it.&quot; Are there any issues she cannot touch at all? &quot;Yes, three.&quot; Reluctantly, she elucidates: the private lives of leaders; the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests of 1989; and the banned spiritual movement, Falun Gong. But although those are the long-term red lines, the actual list is rather longer. Two years ago, when the clamour in the media over children&apos;s deaths in shoddily built schools in the Sichuan earthquake grew too loud, the government simply silenced it, for instance. Chinese media have not touched the subject since. What if CRI refused to report what she judged to be a major story? &quot;I would press that we would cover it, and would argue quite vociferously,&quot; she says. &quot;Honestly, nothing has come up while the show has been on air that [would give me] any reason for dissent. But I have been told that there will be no interference.&quot; Some see the increasing professionalism of members of China&apos;s state media as window dressing: they are still the voice of the Communist party. On this analysis, what may look like increasing freedom is really what media scholar David Bandurski and others dub &quot;Control 2.0&quot; \u2013 instead of only ignoring or suppressing difficult issues, they seek actively to influence public opinion. Some Chinese journalists fear things are regressing, with less room for challenging reporting than a few years ago. Osman says she shares the frustration of those who want faster progress, but compares the current situation to her experience of visiting a television station in Beijing while on holiday a decade ago: &quot;Reporters were called by numbers; news was censored [for] up to 12 hours. I don&apos;t want to be seen as naive and living in a kind of bubble. But from what I have seen, just in the short time I&apos;ve been here, things have changed.&quot; She suggests China &quot;doesn&apos;t really know what news is&quot;. But there are excellent journalists whose stories get censored. Is the problem just that they don&apos;t know how to do news, or is it that they are not allowed to do it? There&apos;s a short silence, followed by a hearty laugh. &quot;I&apos;m just thinking about an appropriate answer,&quot; she says. Yes, she is sure that there are some very good journalists. &quot;But at CRI my impression is they don&apos;t completely understand what news is.&quot; So in came Osman with an agenda of improving news gathering, with better attribution and sourcing. She argues that the show is pushing at the boundaries in small but meaningful ways. For example, on the day British drug dealer Akmal Shaikh was executed, despite his family&apos;s assertions that he was severely mentally ill, they discussed mental disorders. When the US announced a major arms deal with Taiwan, &quot;we had an analyst criticising China \u2013 well, not criticising, but saying how it reacted.&quot; Osman&apos;s innovations are not truly ground-breaking, and English-language media often enjoy greater latitude because of their limited audience. But it is hard to be churlish when she is good-humoured and keen to engage on the issues. She is also candid, reiterating that while she wants to change the culture, she moved for her career, too. Is she not just making state media appear more credible, though? &quot;God!&quot; she exclaims. &quot;That&apos;s a really below-the-belt criticism.&quot; Is it? &quot;Yeah, it is. Hopefully by me being here, people will see it as being more credible, and I will make it as credible as it can be within the confines of my situation . . . I&apos;m not here to change the world \u2013 I&apos;m doing one radio programme.&quot; But she acknowledges that she treads &quot;a very fine line between being editorially credible and not overstepping the mark&quot;. Even if no one has told her not to quote the Dalai Lama&apos;s spokesman, she knows she cannot do it \u2013 surely self-censorship goes with the job? It&apos;s a fair question, she says calmly; but adds that you cannot change a culture overnight. &quot;All I can say is that China is changing and I don&apos;t know how I&apos;m going to feel in a year&apos;s time \u2013 I might not even last. I&apos;m on probation. I might not even be here in six weeks. It might be just too unbearable.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/08/china-us-alliance-under-pressure", "publicationDate": "2010-03-08T18:30:00Z", "tags": ["World news", "Japan", "China", "US foreign policy", "US military", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["If Obama has mismanaged ties with Japan, his problems with China are infinitely greater by comparison, ranging from security issues such as Iran, Taiwan, North Korea and Tibet to fair trade, currency valuations, human rights and climate change."], "title": "China threat can heal US-Japan rift | Simon Tisdall", "article": "A long-running row about relocating a US Marine Corps base on Okinawa is threatening to boil over, with Yukio Hatoyama, Japan&apos;s prime minister, admitting at the weekend that failure to resolve the dispute could force his resignation. Given that his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) swept to a watershed election victory only last August, such an outcome could be deeply embarrassing for the US and deeply resented in Japan. Despite its stated intention to pay greater attention to Asia, the Obama administration is making a hash of relations with Japan. Its insistence that Tokyo&apos;s new centre-left leaders honour a 2006 deal on the Futenma base between George Bush and their long-entrenched conservative predecessors looks like an attempt to ride roughshod over Japan&apos;s democratic process. Blame for rising bilateral strains also lies with Hatoyama, who seems to have promised more than he can deliver. Shigeru Ishiba, a senior Liberal Democrat party opposition leader, openly mocked the prime minister last week for supposedly making an election pledge he had &quot;no idea&quot; how to fulfil. The Okinawa dispute reflects broader differences. Hatoyama&apos;s view that Japan needs a more &quot;balanced&quot; relationship with Washington after 65 years of polite subservience in the security sphere, and his related interest in developing an EEC-style east Asian economic community including China, have produced sharply critical reactions in Washington.&quot;The relationship between the US and Japan is in its worst state ever,&quot; said Hisahiko Okazaki, a former ambassador, in the daily newspaper Sankei Shimbun. &quot;The Japan-US alliance is too valuable an asset to lose,&quot; he wrote. Despite such dramatic huffing and puffing, the bottom-line reality, say senior foreign ministry officials, former and serving ministers, and leading commentators, is there is not the remotest chance that the security alliance will be &quot;lost&quot;. It may be adapted or modified. It may evolve. And for its part, says former deputy foreign minister Hitoshi Tanaka, Japan &quot;needs to think seriously about how it can better contribute to international security&quot; and &quot;to consider if it is still right to stick to the existing interpretation of the constitutional prohibition on the use of force&quot;. But the official consensus is firm that the US relationship will continue to form the &quot;cornerstone&quot; of Japan&apos;s defences, as foreign minister Katsuya Okada put it \u2013 a position shared by Hatoyama.The main reason behind this confidence that, despite all the stresses and strains, the alliance will endure is not hard to discern: growing mutual fear of China. If Obama has mismanaged ties with Japan, his problems with China are infinitely greater by comparison, ranging from security issues such as Iran, Taiwan, North Korea and Tibet to fair trade, currency valuations, human rights and climate change. Obama wants to befriend China and work with it. But if China chooses a diverging path, as it often appears inclined to do, the help and assistance of Japan in containing it will be indispensable to the US \u2013 and vice versa. Underscoring this point, last week&apos;s exchanges over Okinawa coincided with the latest, unsettling broadside from the People&apos;s Liberation Army that, according to some Japanese analysts, calls the shots in Beijing. &quot;China&apos;s big goal in the 21st century is to become world number one, the top power,&quot; wrote PLA senior colonel Liu Mingfu. China, he said, was determined to become the &quot;global champion&quot; while conflict with the US over &quot;who rises and [who] fails to dominate the world&quot; was inevitable. This may be bluster. But it is safer to assume it is not. With this unruly giant bellowing on the doorstep, Japan and the US need each other more than ever. What they lack is new thinking about how to make their relationship work better."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/mar/09/moth-kill-knotweed", "publicationDate": "2010-03-09T00:05:00Z", "tags": ["Invasive species", "Plants", "Insects", "Pesticides", "Environment", "Biology", "Science", "UK news"], "sentences": ["Japanese knotweed, which is native to Japan, Taiwan and China, was introduced by botanists into Britain in the 19th century as an ornamental plant."], "title": "Alien v predator: moth out to kill Japanese knotweed", "article": "Biological warfare is to be declared on an alien invader, Japanese knotweed, that swamps gardens and rivers, with the release of an insect to eat the virulent weed. The decision by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is the first allowing one non-native species, a flying insect resembling a miniature moth, to control the seemingly unstoppable spread of an alien plant. However, it is likely to cause concern among wildlife lovers because of a long history of human interventions in the natural world ending in failure, and sometimes causing worse problems than the original, as with the cane toad in Australia. In a public consultation by Defra last year about 20 responses opposed the scheme, though 42 were in favour. The wildlife minister, Huw Irranca-Davies, said the fast-growing Japanese knotweed was estimated to cost \u00a3150m a year to control, and was able to grow through buildings and roads. Fallopia japonica has also been blamed for flooding, by causing erosion to river banks and clogging up streams with dead plants. &quot;This project is not only ground-breaking, it offers real hope that we can redress the balance,&quot; said Irranca-Davies. Experts estimated in 2003 that it would cost \u00a31.5bn to fund a physical clearance campaign for Japanese knotweed. Laboratory tests were started on pests from Japan which control the knotweed by feeding on sap from its stems, causing the plant to die back. The tests showed the chosen Aphalara itadori did not eat any other species, including closely related British plants and important crops. The psyllids \u2013 or plant-jumping lice, which grows to only 2-2.5mm \u2013 will be released at two sites initially, under close supervision. If these outdoor trials are a success the trials will be extended to another six sites, none of which Defra will disclose. The concept is similar to biological pest control practised by some farmers, using predator insects to control crop pests. The non-native predatory beetle Rhizophagus grandis was also released in Britain under licence in the mid-1980s to tackle the invasive alien spruce bark beetle (Dendroctonus micans). On conservation and wildlife internet forums, opponents of the idea said they feared the impact on other native wildlife, for example species that might start feeding on the psyllids. One blogger compared the risk to the traditional nursery rhyme &quot;I know an old lady who swallowed a fly&quot; in reference to the long pursuit of one animal to destroy another \u2013 ending in the lady swallowing a horse: &quot;She&apos;s dead of course.&quot; The Global Invasive Species Programme said that despite a few well-known failures, a third of biological control programmes to tackle pests and weeds were judged successes, and the system was often considered more &quot;permanent, efficient, environmentally sustainable and relatively cheap&quot; than using chemicals or mechanical removal. &quot;While there are some risks, which still may be considered by some to be unacceptable, biological control is increasingly viewed as being the preferred management strategy for invasive species, wherever possible, and in the case of biological weed control specifically, it has an enviable safety record,&quot; said Sarah Simons, Gisp&apos;s executive director. Japanese knotweed, which is native to Japan, Taiwan and China, was introduced by botanists into Britain in the 19th century as an ornamental plant. It grows at up to a metre a month, and a fragment of just 0.8 grams can grow into a new plant. Invasive predators have become a global problem and are among the top causes of global species threats and extinctions according to conservation experts. The Royal Horticultural Society suggests gardeners destroy knotweed using glyphosate-based weed-killers or by digging out the roots and cutting back regrowth, however it warns that the process can take several seasons. Experts stress that uprooted plants must be destroyed carefully to avoid spreading. &quot;Eradication requires steely determination,&quot; says the RHS. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 March 2010 to correct a headline that incorrectly referred to the psyllid as a moth"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/mar/09/artes-mundi-visual-arts-prize", "publicationDate": "2010-03-09T18:40:25Z", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "UK news", "Wales"], "sentences": ["The other artists are the Peruvian Fernando Bryce, who has lived in Europe for almost 20 years; Chen Chieh-yen, from Taiwan; and Yael Bartana, from Israel."], "title": "Artes Mundi prize contenders' art goes on show", "article": "The work of eight artists competing for the UK&apos;s richest visual arts prize went on display in Wales today\u2013 and none could be accused of triviality. There was no sight of a light being turned off and on at the preview opening of the fourth Artes Mundi prize exhibition in Cardiff. This was big subject art tackling subjects from post-communist social order to consumerism and globalisation. The prize of \u00a340,000 is one of the most lucrative in the world and the biggest in the UK. It is presented every two years and, while it may have a lower profile than the Turner, for example, its status and importance in the world of contemporary art seems to grow each time. Importantly, the prize provides a platform for international artists yet to make a big name for themselves in the UK. This year, nearly 500 were nominated from 80 countries. Tessa Jackson, founding artistic director of Artes Mundi, said one aim had been to increase &quot;the level and scope&quot; of contemporary art on display in Wales, and one direct result has been the decision to create a dedicated space for it in the national museum from next year. &quot;There has been an enormous thirst for what we do and it has been one of the national museum&apos;s most popular exhibitions,&quot; said Jackson. &quot;Beyond Doctor Who and dinosaurs even.&quot; It will be an impressively well-versed visitor who knows the names or work of any of the shortlisted artists. Jackson said: &quot;It has been a very conscious decision to bring together artists who aren&apos;t necessarily part of the London or commercial scene. We want a different range of players. People don&apos;t necessarily know the names of the artists, but they get very engaged with the work and the content of it and what it&apos;s about.&quot; Jackson agreed that all of the artists tackled serious subjects, but said the show was not po-faced. &quot;There is amazing humour in some of the work,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&apos;t fish, but there&apos;s a bit of tickling going on here.&quot; All of the artists this year were shortlisted for their skill in reflecting the politics that surround them, and there was a strong showing by artists from formerly communist countries, including the Albanian Adrian Paci; the Bulgarian Ergin \u00c7avusoglu; the Russian Olga Chernysheva; and Gulnara Kasmalieva and Muratbek Djumaliev, from Kyrgyzstan. The latter pair, who explore ordinary life on the new Silk Road, were not at the prize preview after they were denied visas. The other artists are the Peruvian Fernando Bryce, who has lived in Europe for almost 20 years; Chen Chieh-yen, from Taiwan; and Yael Bartana, from Israel. Many of the exhibits show the continuing strength of film and video art. Bartana, for example, has on display her most recent work, a film called Wall and Tower, in which she imagines the return of the 3 million Jews who lived in Poland before the Nazi occupation. We are the &quot;same but changed&quot; says the orator as Bartana re-enacts the building of a wall and tower in the heart of Warsaw. This new Jewish settlement quickly has barbed wire round it and although it has a welcome sign, it is anything but. Bartana has called herself an amateur anthropologist and examines tricky subjects. &quot;I&apos;ve been exploring anti-semitism, the Jewish and Polish relationship, the economy of responsibility and guilt,&quot; she said. So far, Bartana said she had managed to avoid hostility to her work. &quot;The Polish project is more complicated and touching on some deep wounds. I&apos;m expecting some more difficulties than before, maybe.&quot; The exhibition at Cardiff&apos;s national museum, which opens to the public tomorrow, provides a snapshot of each artist, but they will be judged on their work over the last five to eight years.

Acknowledging &quot;serious disruption&quot; in ties with the US and rising criticism of Chinese assertiveness on the climate, currency, trade and other issues, the premier said he wanted to set the record straight. &quot;Some say China has got more arrogant and tough. Some put forward the theory of China&apos;s so-called &apos;triumphalism&apos;. You have given me an opportunity to explain how China sees itself,&quot; Wen said. In a press conference marking the close of the annual meeting of the National People&apos;s Congress, China&apos;s rubber-stamp parliament, Wen said the country was still developing and would never seek hegemony even when fully modernised, but had always sought to uphold its sovereignty and territorial integrity. He said China was a &quot;responsible&quot; nation that took an active part in international co-operation on major issues. In the angry aftermath of the Copenhagen climate conference, China was accused of wrecking a deal by blocking emission reduction targets for 2050 and failing to send its most senior delegates to key meetings. In his most detailed public comments yet about the conference, Wen responded to critics. &quot;My conscience is untainted despite rumours and slanders from outside,&quot; he said. &quot;It still baffles me why some people are trying to make the issue about China. Climate change is about human survival, the interest of all countries, and issues of equity and justice in the international community.&quot; He accused foreign leaders of a shocking breach of protocol in their attempt to press him, with advance warning, into an unscheduled meeting after a welcome banquet. &quot;Why was China not notified of this meeting? So far, nobody has explained. it is still a mystery to me,&quot; he said. The final deal was the best that could be achieved in the difficult circumstances, he said, promising China&apos;s support for the Copenhagen accord. Asked about other areas of friction, particularly with the US, the premier responded: &quot;The responsibility for the serious disruption in US-China ties does not lie with the Chinese side but with the US.&quot; He cited Barack Obama&apos;s recent meeting with the Dalai Lama, the announcement of US arms sales to Taiwan and disagreements over exchange rates and trade. &quot;We are opposed to the practice of engaging in mutual finger-pointing or taking strong measures to force other countries to appreciate their currencies. That is not in the interest of reform of the renminbi&apos;s exchange rate regime,&quot; the premier said. There is growing pressure for revaluation from the US and Europe, where many analysts argue that the renminbi is massively underpriced. Chinese experts have also argued that a rise in the currency would be in the country&apos;s own interests. Wen told reporters: &quot;I understand some countries want to increase their exports \u2013 what I don&apos;t understand is the practice of depreciating one&apos;s own currency and attempting to press other countries to increase theirs, just to improve exports. In my view that is a protectionist measure.&quot; He went on to warn the US on its own currency, as he did at his last news conference. China holds more US treasury debt than another country. &quot;If I said I was worried [about the US dollar] last year, I still want to make the same remark this year,&quot; he said. &quot;We cannot afford any mistake, however slight, when it comes to financial assets ... I hope the US will take concrete steps to reassure investors.&quot; Turning to domestic issues, the prime minister warned that China faced &quot;an extremely difficult task&quot; in promoting steady and fast growth while restructuring the economy and managing inflationary expectations. Inflation, corruption and unfair income distribution taken together would be &quot;strong enough to affect social stability and even the stability of state power,&quot; he said. The government is seeking to gradually withdraw from the massive stimulus that helped to see China through the global slump, particularly given soaring property prices and rising inflation, which hit 2.7% in the year to February. But it must do so without damaging confidence. The premier warned of the risk of a double-dip in the global economy and said that while the domestic economy had stabilised, many Chinese businesses were still reliant on the stimulus measures."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/mar/14/google-mobile-phone-launch-delay", "publicationDate": "2010-03-14T15:35:53Z", "tags": ["Google", "Apple", "Vodafone", "Mobile phones", "iPad", "iPhone", "Business"], "sentences": ["While Google has been working with the industry on the Android mobile phone software for several years, the Nexus One, made by Taiwan&apos;s HTC, is the first handset over which the search engine group has had complete control."], "title": "Google forced to delay British launch of Nexus phone", "article": "Google&apos;s attempt to break into the mobile phone market has hit serious problems in Britain with the launch of its flagship Nexus One device understood to have been delayed until the middle of next month. The setback means that by the time Google&apos;s first own-branded foray into the market this side of the Atlantic is available to consumers, its local network partner Vodafone will have launched a competing product, which analysts say is better, called the HTC Legend. While Google has been working with the industry on the Android mobile phone software for several years, the Nexus One, made by Taiwan&apos;s HTC, is the first handset over which the search engine group has had complete control. But launching a new phone has proved more difficult than Google expected. It was released in the US in January, but Google&apos;s decision to sell it solely through its website immediately came in for criticism as buyers struggled to get help with technical problems, and Google, which has traditionally relied on email for consumer contact, was forced to introduce telephone helplinessupport and the problems it has experienced in the US has given it reason to pause over the phone&apos;s launch outside the US, to make sure it has its customer service operations in place. Last week Goldman Sachs slashed its estimate for Nexus One sales this year from 3.5m units to 1m worldwide. In the UK, Google will not only sell the phone at full price to any customer who wants to put their existing sim card into it, but it has also teamed up with Vodafone, which will offer the device free to anyone willing to sign a \u00a335 monthly contract. But the delay in the launch of the Nexus One, which under Google&apos;s original plan would have been available earlier this month, means that it will come after the launch of rival Android devices that analysts reckon are at least as good, if not better. Vodafone, for instance, will be offering the HTC Legend in April which has the same operating system as the Nexus One but is more stylish: being built from a single piece of milled aluminium. Orange and T-Mobile, meanwhile, will both be stocking the HTC Desire \u2013 which is exactly the same as the Nexus One, but has an optical trackpad instead of a trackball \u2013 from next month. The delay also means the Google device will be available in the UK only weeks before another hotly anticipated gadget, Apple&apos;s iPad. Several of the UK&apos;s mobile phone companies are finalising deals with Apple to sell the tablet computer to British consumers. Unlike its last mobile device, the iPhone, which was offered through just one exclusive partner for the first two years, the iPad is expected to be available through multiple network operators from the start. Apple will ship two versions of the iPad in the UK, one that can access the internet using short-range wi-fi networks and one that can also access 3G mobile phone networks. But Apple needs to sign deals with at least one UK mobile network, because the iPad makes use of micro-sims, meaning that buyers cannot just put the sim card from their existing handsets into it. In fact, it will be the first device launched in the UK that uses micro-sims. Apple said earlier this month that the device will go on sale in the UK towards the end of April but the mobile phone companies believe that the 3G version of the iPad will not be available until May. Orange, T-Mobile, O2 and Vodafone all expect to be selling the iPad to customers and they are all locked in talks with the Californian company. Apple, however, has made it plain that it does not want iPad users to be tied to long-term contracts with any mobile phone operator. Instead it wants users to be able to pay for mobile network access on a pay-as-you-go basis. Vodafone refused to comment.

Lawyers representing Yong Vui Kong, a 22-year old Malaysian, argued that the mandatory death sentence violates international standards and human rights laws. Singapore executes anyone found guilty of importing more than 15g of drugs. It is one of the few countries in the world to impose mandatory death sentences for drug offences. &quot;This is a young man, only 22, who committed a non-violent offence,&quot; said Saul Lehrfreund, co-founder of the Death Penalty Project, a London-based legal program that appeals against death sentences. &quot;The court in Singapore has no choice by to impose death by hanging, regardless of the individual circumstances of the case. In this day and age that just seems ludicrous.&quot; Kong, whom lawyers describe as &quot;impoverished and vulnerable&quot;, was due to be hanged last December until lawyers obtained an emergency reprieve. He was convicted in 2008 of smuggling 47g of heroin into Singapore. The case is regarded by experts as an important challenge to the country&apos;s death penalty and has attracted media attention across Asia, where executing people for drug offences remains controversial. Taiwan recently absolished the mandatory death penalty. China, which continues to execute prisoners for 68 different offences including 44 non-violent crimes, allows judicial discretion in sentencing drug-related cases. Singapore has seen a big decline in its use of the death penalty since having the highest execution rate in the world in the 1990s, but the government is resisting any change to the law. Singapore&apos;s attorney general, Walter Woon, has argued that parliament has the power to show mercy in individual cases. Kong was refused mercy in December, and his lawyers are arguing that the courts and not the executive should have the discretionary power. &quot;It can&apos;t be right that an administrative body not amenable to judicial review effectively becomes the sentencing body,&quot; said Lehrfreund. &quot;There is a clear global trend away from sentencing people to death without taking their age, vulnerability and other powerful mitigating factors into account.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/mar/20/japan-investment-funds-stock-market", "publicationDate": "2010-03-20T00:05:30Z", "tags": ["Investment funds", "Investments", "Money", "Investing", "Business", "Stock markets"], "sentences": ["Japan is the biggest investor in China, directly and through companies the Japanese control in Taiwan."], "title": "Will Japan's investment funds blossom again?", "article": "Chris Taylor constantly wrestles with the paradoxes of investing in Japan. He runs Neptune Japan Opportunities, the best-performing fund for Brits wanting to invest in the country, but almost revels in telling you what a basket case Japan has become. The economy is &quot;ugly beyond belief&quot; and the country has &quot;bucket loads of problems&quot;, he warns. Neptune&apos;s economist, James Dowey, chips in with dismal figures on Japan&apos;s GDP. It&apos;s \u00a5500tn (\u00a33.7tn), but was at the same nominal level more than a decade ago. This is a country that is flatlining. How do corporates react in such an unfavourable environment? The answer is to cut investment, capital expenditure and wages. And in aggregate, it means no one increases their bottom line. Companies can&apos;t raise profitability and face a vicious downward spiral. So why has he brought a group of financial journalists to Tokyo? To write that investors should dump his fund? This has got to be the oddest press trip on record \u2026 But Taylor hasn&apos;t lost his marbles. He doesn&apos;t buy Japan. What he buys is Japanese companies. In sector after sector, he says he can find three or four companies that are world class and which are often the dominant global player in their market. He takes us to Toray Industries. In the 1950s it was competing against Britain&apos;s Courtaulds in the rayon market. Soon, Toray was facing the same sort of price competition that drove Courtaulds from the market. But instead of rolling over it invested in research and development, seeking new markets for materials. Now it&apos;s the world leader in carbon-fibre technology with global sales of some $12bn (\u00a37.9bn).     japan funds table    Half its manufacturing plants are in Japan, and inevitably the business took a hammering when demand imploded as the global recession began to bite. Its response says a lot about Japanese capitalism. Senior vice-president Norihiko Saitou tells us it embarked on cost-cutting which included 30% pay cuts for board members, the axing of bonuses for managers and the end of overtime. But redundancies were out of the question. &quot;It is a very important company policy not to lay off people,&quot; he tells us, through an interpreter. It has a 30-year plan for carbon fibres, a lightweight material that is replacing steel in aeroplanes and cars, and so substantially reduces weight and energy use. Boeing has signed it up to supply materials for its Dreamliner.It&apos;s this approach which may explain why Toray is a world leader and Courtaulds a shadow of its former self. And Toray&apos;s share price is around \u00a5505, up 43% from \u00a5353 last March. Taylor reckons scores of Japanese companies such as Toray are ideally placed to benefit from not just the recovery in world trade but the coming boom. Global GDP was $55tn in 2007. He believes it will be $80tn by 2015, but most of that growth will be in non-OECD countries. &quot;The Chinese haven&apos;t even begun to gear up,&quot; he says. Japan is the biggest investor in China, directly and through companies the Japanese control in Taiwan. Taylor&apos;s strategy is to buy Japanese multinationals, avoid stocks exposed to the moribund domestic economy and hedge the currency. He is a big fan of hedging and warns of the value traps that so often ensnare investors in Japan. His analysis of global debt took him out of banks and real estate in 2007. He&apos;s back in financials and multinationals now but is fully hedged in the belief that the yen will fall. He finds the domestic economic situation in Japan almost comically bad, with a paralysed and corrupted political class unable to cope with the daunting challenges of a rapidly ageing population and colossal fiscal deficit. Shigeki Morinobu, president of the Japan Tax Institute, shows us a graph that makes Alistair Darling&apos;s budget challenge look like child&apos;s play. Government spending this year will be around \u00a5100tn, tax receipts around \u00a537tn. Japan is hooked on government spending so far in excess of what it raises in taxes that it just can&apos;t find a way out. Much of that money goes on pensions and healthcare for the elderly, where the bill just keeps rising. Government debt has topped 200% of GDP, and financing it from famously thrifty Japanese households can&apos;t go on much longer. The savings ratio has plummeted from 20% of national income two decades ago to 2% today. Crunch time for Japan could come in the 2011 budget. Government spending, which has propped up the economy since the bubble burst in the early 1990s, must fall. Taxes may have to rise. Either way, it makes the prospect for the domestic economy grim. But it will force a substantial devaluation of the yen, which will help Taylor&apos;s holdings in those Japanese multinationals. JO Hambro&apos;s Scott McGlashan, who has one of the longest records of investing in Japan, believes 2010 will be a strong year for the Tokyo stock market. &quot;On most metrics, Japanese equities are near historically cheap levels,&quot; he says. &quot;Strong research and development bodes well for Japanese trade and innovation over the long term.&quot; But investment consultant Allenbridge warns that Japan has been the most disappointing major stock market in the world over the past 20 years, with the Nikkei 225 at barely a quarter of its 1989 peak. &quot;There have been false dawns galore, with &apos;stale&apos; bulls pinning their hopes on the old saw of what goes down must eventually go up. There have been short-term blips but it has been a depressing long-term experience.&quot; However it now believes Tokyo &quot;may finally offer good opportunities, provided investors pick carefully&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/mar/23/us-google-china-reaction", "publicationDate": "2010-03-23T18:52:18Z", "tags": ["Google", "Internet", "Censorship", "China", "Freedom of speech", "Human rights", "Search engines", "Press freedom", "Digital media", "US news", "Technology", "Media", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Relations between Washington and Beijing have been strained over the last few months, with Chinese protests over Barack Obama meeting the Dalai Lama at the White House and over US arms sales to Taiwan, and on the other side Congress near incandescent with rage over the Sino-US trade imbalance, blaming it on currency manipulation by Beijing.", "Paal said it was not a narrative that he recognised: &quot;I do not see the relationship as having worsened in recent months.&quot; Paal, vice-president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a senior adviser on Asian affairs in the Reagan and George Bush senior&apos;s administrations, said: &quot;I do not think the relationship is bad and the Chinese and their US counterparts are doing their best to contain public opinion.&quot; Other Washington-based analysts, concurring with Paal, said the top priority for the Obama administration was not Google, the Dalai Lama or arms sales to Taiwan but getting Chinese backing for UN sanctions against Iran over its alleged nuclear weapons programme.", "While Beijing denounced the visit of the Dalai Lama and the arms sales to Taiwan, it did not retaliate."], "title": "Google shift to Hong Kong played down by US", "article": "The Obama administration matched the Chinese government today in its determination to prevent the Google row from damaging bilateral ties.

The Obama administration could have picked it up as an issue with which to beat China \u2013 the row offers a vivid example of the kind of internet censorship Clinton has been campaigning against. But the White House opted instead to play down the row. Mike Hammer, Obama&apos;s National Security Council spokesman, expressed disappointment that Google and the Chinese government had been unable to reach a deal. He said the White House remained committed to internet freedom but did not see it damaging relations. &quot;The US-China relationship is mature enough to sustain differences, and while we seek to expand co-operation on issues of mutual interest with China, we will candidly and frankly address areas of disagreement,&quot; he said. Google had worked closely with the Obama administration, which it informed in advance of its decision to switch its China operations to Hong Kong.

There was no such desire in Washington today. Douglas Paal, one of the leading China specialists in Washington, said: &quot;Officials are trying to keep the relationship on an even keel and isolate confrontation.&quot; He added that some in the US media had presented a narrative that Obama had offered China a hand of friendship last year and Beijing had rejected it.

Securing Chinese support is difficult but US officials hope they will at least be able to persuade Beijing not to use its security council veto and instead abstain, allowing sanctions to go ahead. Another priority for Washington is China&apos;s positive role in trying to persuade North Korea to renounce nuclear weapons. While Beijing denounced the visit of the Dalai Lama and the arms sales to Taiwan, it did not retaliate. Significantly, it allowed a visit by a US warship to Hong Kong to go ahead as planned, as well as a series of high-profile bilateral meetings. The US Treasury announced yesterday that one of the most significant of these meetings \u2013 the US-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue meeting \u2013 is to be held in Beijing in May, with Clinton and the Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner. There are potential flashpoints ahead, however. The Obama administration is under pressure from Congress to formally label China a currency manipulator when the Treasury releases its annual report on 15 April.

There are four guys eating excrement together, named after the four big Chinese portals: Netease, QQ, Baidu and Google.cn. After some time, Google.cn declared it too smelly and left. Netease frowned, QQ didn&apos;t respond, while Baidu took Google&apos;s seat and plate and ate for two. It&apos;s a joke, but it reflects the situation in China. A renowned writer in Taiwan, Bo Yang, once said that Chinese people have been living in a huge smelly pickle jar together for about 5,000 years, and nobody wants to change that even though they all know it&apos;s unpleasant. Google jumped into this jar four years ago but forgot to bring their principles with them. Unfortunately, they didn&apos;t bring any new rules to the game and just joined in. Some time later, they found the pickle jar even less pleasant than they had expected. The Google motto &quot;Don&apos;t be evil&quot; became &quot;Don&apos;t be too evil&quot;. Fortunately, they woke up and started to correct it. After a hopeless wandering in China, they finally took the decision to stay away from the big jar and clean themselves up. Chinese netizens on Twitter and other social media tools applauded. Google has decided to move the search engine from mainland China to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Why do this? Because what Google learnt from China is the art of war. They bowed out gracefully and saved China&apos;s face, as well as reducing the Chinese propaganda machine&apos;s ability to attack them in the longer run. They did not pull out of the Chinese market completely. And Hong Kong is part of China after all. Google acted like gentlemen in their news statement: they didn&apos;t blame the Chinese authorities. Instead Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, appeased the Chinese government successfully. How will the jar respond? I see a lot of propaganda machines revving up over the past two days to blame Google, and expect more to weigh in during the coming week. Then what? There will be no games because the rival has left the battleground. Compared to Google, the Chinese authorities have lost the initiative \u2013 and the war in the long run. Google is brave to have reflected and changed. In the end, they didn&apos;t become the preserved pickle in the Chinese market. They turned around and decided to stay away from the smelly jar without irritating the government too much. They will not have to argue the problem any more because they are now out of the jar and hold a powerful position: they can do everything they want, totally freely. You may ask why there are more and more Twitter users in China who focus on Google. The reason is because Twitter.com is not in the jar after China&apos;s censors pushed them out of the Great Firewall. But don&apos;t worry: Chinese netizens have millions of ways to catch up with them by scaling that wall. Google&apos;s courage teaches us a lot, and history will remember it."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/24/us-china-internet-censorship-human-rights", "publicationDate": "2010-03-24T18:00:01Z", "tags": ["US foreign policy", "US news", "China", "Censorship", "Google", "Internet", "Human rights", "Hillary Clinton", "Barack Obama", "Technology", "World news", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Growing US pressure on China over human rights and freedom of information coincides with a string of other flashpoints in bilateral relations, ranging from Taiwan to Tibet to tyres."], "title": "Gloves are off between US and China | Simon Tisdall", "article": "Leading Chinese human rights activists are urging western internet companies and service providers to follow Google&apos;s example in refusing to bow to Beijing&apos;s online censorship. Their intervention highlights how the high-profile tussle over freedom of information on the net is becoming part of a widening, multifaceted political confrontation between the US and China&apos;s increasingly assertive communist government. Bob Fu, a former leader of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement and founder of the US-based rights body, ChinaAid, applauded Google&apos;s decision to defy Beijing&apos;s censors. &quot;They are on the right path. Freedom of information is a basic human right defined by international conventions. I encourage other companies like Microsoft and Yahoo to stand up and not sell their consciences for more renminbi in their pockets,&quot; Fu said today. Fu&apos;s remarks came amid indications that the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, is keen to carry the fight to Beijing over what she sees as its indefensible internet censorship \u2013 although President Barack Obama is said to be less sure. An American strategy that focused tightly on upholding free speech could induce more western companies to refuse to play by China&apos;s rules. Getting its retaliation in first, the official People&apos;s Daily newspaper today accused Google of colluding with US government spy agencies. Fu and another prominent activist, the Beijing-based human rights lawyer Li Baiguang, visited London and Brussels this week to draw the attention of policymakers and MPs to what they say are worsening human rights problems in China following the 2008 Olympics. Official attempts to restrict public information about individual cases, or to use the net to monitor political opponents, were part of a broader problem, they suggested. Li said he had been detained and physically attacked on many occasions, and jailed three times, while pursuing cases involving abuses of human rights and religious freedom or unjust local government practices. He said it was entirely possible he would face arrest again on his return to China. &quot;The public security people are always wanting to talk to me. We are forced to have tea together,&quot; he said with a smile. Li highlighted the case of Alimujiang Yimiti, a Uighur Christian living in Xinjiang province, who was sentenced to 15 years in jail last year for &quot;instigating separatism and revealing state secrets&quot;. Li said Alimujiang&apos;s actual offence, if it could be thus termed, was talking to visiting American Christians. Security officials had manufactured evidence and the conduct of his trial was illegal under Chinese law, Li said. Subsequent appeals to higher authorities in Beijing proved futile. Fu drew attention to the case of Gao Zhisheng, which has received limited coverage inside China, owing to state control of the media. He said it was more than 400 days since Gao, the country&apos;s best-known human rights lawyer, a constant thorn in the side of the Chinese authorities and a Nobel peace prize nominee, had &quot;disappeared&quot; from his home in Shanxi province. There has been no sign of him since, raising fears about his safety. Fu said Gao had been repeatedly arrested, imprisoned and tortured since 2005. He recounted one incident in which the lawyer said he was accused of being a traitor, beaten and electrocuted during a 53-day detention incurred after he wrote to a US congressman before the Olympics detailing human rights abuses. Fu said he had spoken to Gao days before he vanished in February last year and that the lawyer had expressed no intention of leaving home. &quot;Rumours and lies surround his absence,&quot; Fu said. &quot;Silencing his voice is the only solution the Chinese leadership can come up with. They should concentrate instead on correcting an unjust system.&quot; Li and Fu said western governments, churches and the public should put more pressure on China&apos;s leaders to abide by the rule of law, noting that when administrative lawsuits were set in train, the behaviour of state officials invariably improved. They also urged support for a public petition demanding Gao&apos;s release, which has so far been signed by 124,000 people in 180 countries. Growing US pressure on China over human rights and freedom of information coincides with a string of other flashpoints in bilateral relations, ranging from Taiwan to Tibet to tyres. Moves are afoot in Congress to impose new tariffs on Chinese imports, while the US treasury may officially declare China to be a &quot;currency manipulator&quot; next month due to the low value of the yuan. In another sign that the gloves are coming off, a report published in Washington this week blames unfair Chinese trade practices for 2.4m US job losses since 2001. Whether Chinese internet users will be allowed to read the report is open to question."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/mar/28/cern-particle-physics-space-antimatter", "publicationDate": "2010-03-28T00:05:34Z", "tags": ["Cern", "Science", "Nasa", "Space", "Particle physics", "Technology"], "sentences": ["In total, more than 500 scientists from 56 institutions across Europe, China and Taiwan have worked in these conditions to provide free labour and expertise to build the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, one of the most complex and controversial instruments ever built to carry out astronomical research."], "title": "Nasa goes in search of the definite particle", "article": "We are in a windowless, airtight room in a basement at Cern, in countryside outside Geneva, where dozens of scientists are gathered round a huge, drum-shaped device. They make an odd sight. Each is kitted out in clean-room togs of nylon coats, plastic slippers and hairnets. Some clutch clipboards. Other stare into computers linked, via a maze of cabling on the floor, to the 10-tonne machine in the centre of the room. In total, more than 500 scientists from 56 institutions across Europe, China and Taiwan have worked in these conditions to provide free labour and expertise to build the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, one of the most complex and controversial instruments ever built to carry out astronomical research. In the midst of this apparent scientific confusion, the impassive figure of the Nobel prize-winning physicist Sam Ting orchestrates proceedings as if by telepathy. He rarely speaks and never smiles. &quot;Enjoy!&quot; was his only utterance to me when I joined his group of assistants to watch them in action. I discovered later that this represented an unusually effusive greeting for the 74-year-old physicist. Such paucity of speech contrasts dramatically with Ting&apos;s ambition, however. He has laboured for the past 15 years to build an instrument that is likely to be flown on the last-ever mission by the space shuttle to the International Space Station where, for the next three years, it will survey the skies in a bid to answer key questions about the universe. Where do cosmic rays come from? Could there be galaxies made of antimatter on the other side the universe? And what is the true nature of dark matter? Scientists consider the AMS to be a masterpiece of space engineering. It fits snugly into the hold of the space shuttle but exploits the same technology that is used to run giant particle colliders like Cern&apos;s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) \u2013 including a super-conducting magnet whose currents will be chilled to minus 270C. &quot;Basically, the AMS is an all-purpose particle detector moved into space,&quot; says Ting, who is based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Such scientific sophistication is all the more the striking because the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer is destined to be the only instrument capable of carrying out any kind of serious research on the space station, which has been heavily criticised for the flimsiness of its scientific aspirations. It possesses no other dedicated specialised equipment. Experiments carried out there will be limited to fairly trivial research on materials and biology in zero-gravity conditions. In 2002, a US National Academy of Sciences report described the station as a waste of money that would &quot;never achieve the status of a world-class research laboratory&quot;. The one exception to such criticism is the AMS. Its scope and design are groundbreaking. It will study cosmic ray particles that have energies comparable with particles created by the LHC (the largest particle accelerator ever built). Yet the AMS will run on only 2.5 kilowatts of power \u2013 less than that needed to run a hair-drier \u2013 which will be generated by its solar panels. &quot;The official price of the AMS is $300m,&quot; says Professor Martin Pohl of Geneva University, a team leader for this project. &quot;But if you add in the cost of scientists&apos; time, as well as the cost of the shuttle launch, which is America&apos;s contribution to the project, then you get a price tag of more than $1.5bn, which is close to that of the LHC. But then this is a very special machine.&quot; Special it certainly is, but the AMS has also proved controversial and its inclusion in the station&apos;s construction has been bedevilled by political intrigue. The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), under the leadership of its previous administrator, Michael Griffin, flatly refused to fly the device to the space station. Particle physics had no place there, it was decreed, and for many years it seemed as if the AMS would end up languishing in a Nasa storeroom despite the vast sums spent on its construction. Cosmic rays were discovered in 1912 by the Austrian physicist Victor Hess. On balloon flights, he found that atoms of nitrogen, oxygen and other gases were being ionised in increasing numbers as he gained height. Some form of radiation was beaming down on Earth and knocking electrons from atoms of these gases in the upper atmosphere, he realised. These mysterious interstellar visitors were subsequently called cosmic rays, though today we know they are not actually rays. They are sub-atomic particles \u2013 mostly protons and alpha particles \u2013 that stream down on our planet at colossal energy, sometimes travelling close to the speed of light. The origin of these emanations remains a mystery, though scientists do have their ideas. &quot;The lighter cosmic ray particles are probably leftovers from the Big Bang,&quot; says Professor Pohl. &quot;The heavier ones were probably blown into space by supernovae explosions.&quot; It will be one of the key tasks of the AMS to solve this mystery. The device is, in effect, a large tube surrounded by a powerful, super-conducting magnet. The mighty field it generates will deflect particles as they fly through the tunnel while instruments, similar to those used in the LHC, will determine the charge, mass, velocity and energy of those particles. &quot;Basically, we will point it at deep space and see what comes through,&quot; says Chris Tutt, one of the project&apos;s US managers. This is a crucial point, for it is not just cosmic rays that scientists expect to fly into the AMS. They have a whole shopping list of other entities they hope will pop up in its detectors, including that most mysterious of substances, antimatter. Theories indicate that equal amounts of antimatter and normal matter should have been created in the Big Bang. Thus the universe should have its fair share of antimatter galaxies. These in turn should be filled with antimatter stars with their own antimatter worlds. If we take the idea of this mirror-image universe far enough, we could envisage these antimatter worlds containing antimatter people who live in antihomes and sit on antichairs with anti-antimacassars on the back. At least that&apos;s the theory. Unfortunately, despite considerable efforts, researchers have found not a single atom of antimatter in their searches. A brief flight by an early version of the AMS on the shuttle in 1998 revealed no signs of antimatter, while a joint Russian-Italian probe called Pamela \u2013 the Payload for Antimatter Exploration and Light Nuclei Astrophysics \u2013 has drawn a similar cosmological blank. These experiments have worked on the assumption that just as normal cosmic ray particles are produced by stars made of normal matter, then antimatter cosmic rays should be detectable if they are being sprayed into space from antimatter sources. An anti-particle which enters the AMS tunnel will bend in the opposite direction to a normal cosmic ray particle because it has a different electrical change and the AMS&apos;s detectors will reveal its presence. &quot;The AMS is designed to tell the difference between positively charged and negatively charged cosmic rays,&quot; says Pohl. &quot;So if we start picking up heavy particles of antimatter that means that somewhere nearby there is a pocket of antimatter. It could even mean there is antimatter star near us. Imagine!&quot; In fact, Pohl is pretty sure that anti-matter from a local star will not pop up on the AMS&apos;s detectors. At very best, it may pick up one or two heavy ions of antimatter that have hurtled towards us from an antimatter galaxy at the other end of the universe. &quot;We have already found on our brief early flight of AMS on the space shuttle that there is no sign of the stuff in our galaxy or even in our local cluster of satellites. &quot;I don&apos;t think we will find anti-matter,&quot; he adds, &quot;and in a way that is a far more fascinating prospect. We have had 13 billion years for the universe&apos;s antimatter to disappear but we have no idea how that could have happened. It will therefore be more fascinating not to find antimatter than to find it. We will learn more from not observing something than from observing it.&quot; This is a mouth-watering prospect if you care about the structure of the universe. Nor is issue of antimatter&apos;s existence the only contentious issue that AMS may help resolve. There is also the prospect that it will detect dark matter. Astronomers are convinced that as yet undetected particles permeate the universe providing galaxies with extra mass. Some of these strange little entities may show up on the AMS&apos;s instruments and open up a complete new chapter in cosmological physics. Certainly, great things are expected of the AMS, which makes the battle to fly it to the space station so remarkable. In the end, faced by the intransigeance of Nasa, Ting lobbied the US Congress, backed by Nobel laureates such as Steven Weinberg. &quot;Ting may say little but when he wants something he can be very persuasive,&quot; says Steve Myers, Cern&apos;s director of accelerators. For his part, Weinberg was unequivocal. Results from the AMS would be the only significant science ever done on the space station. This device could make discoveries that are earth-shattering. Nasa chief Michael Griffin was hauled before a hearing in 2008. &quot;It is almost like cutting off our nose to spite our face,&quot; said a dismayed Bill Nelson, the Democrat senator for Florida. A year later, Griffin was replaced by the current Nasa chief, Charles Bolden. &quot;Five days later, we were back on the launch manifest for the space shuttle,&quot; says Pohl. Finally, an act of Congress was passed to ensure that the AMS would be flown to the space station before the US shuttle fleet is grounded at the end of this year. This flight is currently scheduled to take place in July, on the penultimate shuttle launch, although Pohl has warned the AMS is unlikely to be ready until the end of the year, most probably on the shuttle&apos;s very last flight. If so, it will make a dramatic finale for the space shuttle, for the AMS will provide scientists, for the first time, with a complex detector, stationed outside Earth&apos;s atmosphere, that will allow them to study high-energy particles in space. Anything could turn up in its detectors. As Sam Ting says: &quot;We will be exploring whole new territories. The possibility for discovery is off the chart.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/28/barack-obama-healthcare-israel", "publicationDate": "2010-03-28T00:07:12Z", "tags": ["World news", "Barack Obama", "US healthcare", "Obama administration", "Israel", "China", "Nuclear weapons", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["There was a further chilling of relations on climate change, America&apos;s vast trade deficit with China, arms sales to Taiwan and a suspicion that China&apos;s currency the renminbi \u2013 or people&apos;s money \u2013 is undervalued to give China a trade advantage."], "title": "Principled and passionate: how Obama sealed his place in history | Henry Porter", "article": "These days, when you hear so much from people about what, or who, they are going to vote against, while they complain bitterly that no politicians or set of policies match their particular requirements, it is worth listening to the words Barack Obama used to rally his Democrat troops before the healthcare vote last week.

This is one of those times where you can honestly say to yourself, doggone it, this is exactly why I came here. This is why I got into politics. This is why I got into public service\u2026 we are not bound to win, but we are bound to be true.&quot; What a wonderful phrase that is about vindicating all your best hopes for yourself and the country. This is the finest of political aspirations and as a whole the speech tells you a lot about the tough commitment required from politicians and the public to make democracy work properly today. The speech will bookmark the history of his presidency and do what the proclamation on the emancipation of slaves did for the presidency of Abraham Lincoln in 1862, and the Civil Rights Act for Lyndon Johnson in 1964. There&apos;s still a long way to go on the new universal health insurance scheme, which will affect millions of black people and which caused such feeling between Republicans and Democrats that black members of Congress were subject to racist insults from protesters on Capitol Hill, but an irreversible change has occurred in the administration, as well as the country. Obama has become the president that he was elected to be. He slugged it out to win a bruising political victory for himself but greater equality and fairness for America&apos;s less well off too. There is a truly moving continuity of purpose that links 1862, 1964 and 2010. Obama&apos;s first year or so, exactly like Lincoln&apos;s, has been characterised as consisting of disappointment, failed initiatives, false starts and what many regard as far too much deliberation. Americans of all colours and stripe were disgruntled. The Tea Party protest swelled with a strident, inchoate panic about un-American policies, a reflex that Lincoln and Johnson would both have recognised because this kind of allergic reaction was the measure of the changes they promulgated. The presidency has a spring in its step, there is a halo of power that can only be won in battle and now suddenly the rest of the enormous canvas on which the modern US president operates seems broken with shafts of light that are as much due to the exercise of principle as to intrigue and low politics. Following his triumph on Sunday, Obama met Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday to discuss new settlements in east Jerusalem, which the administration has consistently opposed because they threaten progress on peace talks. Bibi didn&apos;t give an inch on the settlements, so Obama left him to his own devices while he had dinner, which, according to one Israeli newspaper, was the sort of treatment reserved for the president of Equatorial New Guinea. &quot;I&apos;m still around, let me know if there is anything new,&quot; said the chief, the man who knows that at the last count Israel receives $3bn in aid annually from the US, to say little of military hardware, intelligence and diplomatic favours. Did someone whisper the phrase &quot;client state&quot;? It certainly seemed so. Bibi and his defence minister, Ehud Barak, disappeared to their embassy muttering about insecure telephones. Actually, the tough-minded Obama presidency has been coming into focus for a while now. Next month, 40 heads of state will attend a summit on nuclear security, one of Obama&apos;s key areas of policy, which now opens with an agreement, patiently and coolly reached between Russia and the US on missile reduction. George Bush shot his mouth off, bombed and spent a lot while doing nothing to tackle the great strategic issues. But Obama is moving with a steady gaze towards several big prizes, not all of which he is going to claim, but at least he knows what they are \u2013 &quot;We are not bound to win, but we are bound to be true.&quot; Last year, he met the Dalai Lama at the White House, causing the Chinese to have conniptions. There was a further chilling of relations on climate change, America&apos;s vast trade deficit with China, arms sales to Taiwan and a suspicion that China&apos;s currency the renminbi \u2013 or people&apos;s money \u2013 is undervalued to give China a trade advantage. This may harden into an accusation with next month&apos;s US Treasury Department report on exchange rate practices. Then there is Google&apos;s commendable withdrawal from the Chinese mainland because of censorship, which is certainly in keeping with Obama&apos;s stand on human rights in China. I mention this because while Rupert Murdoch&apos;s Fox News network in the US has been spewing out daily dose of mustard gas on the health bill, talking about freedom of choice and messy European socialism, another branch of Murdoch&apos;s unlovely empire \u2013 MySpace China \u2013 happily complies with the censorship of a socialist state. That kind of naked self-interest \u2013 and hypocrisy \u2013 suddenly seems so old fashioned. There is a sense, too, that Republicans are chasing down some unfeasible evolutionary dead end and, although they may do well in the midterms next November, Obama is the one who will continue to make history. There are some problems and doubts. Obama has committed to a project in Afghanistan which is probably not going to work and on the question of human rights, he has failed to find the solution to Guant\u00e1namo and has backed DNA testing on arrest in the US, which will ensure a racial bias in samples retained. I hate to say it but sometimes these blind spots, as well as the boldness, remind me of Blair. Ted Kennedy wrote to Obama last May just before he died telling him that he was sure that Obama would be the man to sign the healthcare bill, the political cause of Kennedy&apos;s life, because Obama knew that at stake were &quot;fundamental principles of social justice and the character of our country&quot;. Last week was American politics in all its gruelling and imperfect magnificence. It&apos;s good to remember that things can change for the better, even in Britain, where we could do with some hard-nosed principle."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/31/google-china-blocking-searches", "publicationDate": "2010-03-31T09:14:02Z", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Google", "Internet", "Technology", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Separately, journalists in China and Taiwan, and other users whose work relates to China, complained that their Yahoo email accounts had been compromised, leaving most of them unable to use their accounts \u2014 though the majority had since had access restored."], "title": "Google blames China's 'great firewall' for blocking searches", "article": "Google searches were available again across China today, after several hours of problems that the internet giant blamed on changes to the government&apos;s filtering system.

The Foreign Correspondents&apos; Club of China said in a statement that it knew of eight such cases in recent weeks. Google cited an intrusion into its system targeting the email accounts of human rights activists and intellectual property as one reason for its decision to stop self-censoring. It also cited wider attempts to access email accounts via malware and increasing censorship of the internet in China.

But if one explanation \u2013 that the ship struck a North Korean mine \u2013 is true, the men of the Cheonan will have become the latest casualties of the world&apos;s longest-running military conflict. This is not to say that North Korea meant to sink the Cheonan, though that cannot be ruled out. But regardless of intent, the state of congealed hostilities that exists on the 38th parallel is a dangerous anachronism. It is time it ended. The Korean peninsula is the final holdout of the cold war. The US, in the aftermath of the second world war, partitioned a country that had a history of nearly a thousand years as a unified kingdom, and whose citizens had a creditable record of fighting the Japanese. The US propped up a rightwing dictatorship in the south; the communist guerrilla leader, Kim Il-sung, established his dynasty in the north. When the US withdrew its troops in 1950, Kim invaded in an attempt to reunite the country. After he was beaten back to the 38th parallel, the US-led UN forces invaded the north, bringing China into the war. By 1953, after three years of heavy casualties and the devastation by bombing of North Korea, a truce was signed at the 38th parallel, and a dangerous stand-off began. A peace treaty was never concluded, though it has remained on the agenda, including the so far unproductive six-party talks. Though it seems unbelievable now, there was little to choose between the standards of living in North and South Korea until the 1980s \u2013 and, until democracy finally came to the south in the same decade, both were dictatorships. Then the USSR&apos;s collapse deprived North Korea of the cheap energy its economy relied on, and the south began its spectacular modernisation. Now, despite help from China, the north is an economic basket case and South Koreans worry about the economic and social costs of reunification, however remote the prospect. Reunification is unlikely to get closer without the first step of a peace treaty \u2013 a longstanding North Korean aspiration \u2013 that normalises relations with the south and US. Only then could North Korea begin what will undoubtedly be a tortuous road to domestic reform and economic recovery, and only then is there likely to be progress in defusing North Korea&apos;s nuclear programme. There is no magic bullet to resolve this crisis. But waiting for North Korea to collapse \u2013 which seems still to be at the heart of US policy \u2013 has little to recommend it. Paranoid garrison states do not collapse easily; nor can dictatorships be relied on to go down without a heavy price in human suffering. We might wish the regime away, but should be careful about how we seek to make it happen. There are arguably more dependable routes. The west has been close to buying out North Korea&apos;s nuclear weapons programme with the promise of a controlled and subsidised programme of nuclear energy. This would help to stabilise the economy and allow North Korea to stop relying on its weapons programme as its only international leverage. There are many examples of authoritarian dictatorships that evolved into more humane systems through contact, trade, cultural exchange and normalisation: South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam all had decades of authoritarianism. China, the biggest of all, was at its most paranoid and repressive from the late 50s to the mid-70s. They changed through growth, development, and domestic \u2013 not external \u2013 pressure. China&apos;s approach to North Korea has evolved with its own development. Once seen as a buffer against US aggression, North Korea is now China&apos;s problem child, rattling its nuclear programme to gain attention, a source of instability on China&apos;s border. While China has thrived with economic liberalisation, North Korea continues on the road to bankruptcy, in part because of the regime&apos;s refusal to reform. China is growing tired of a game that has long outlived its usefulness, and anxious about North Korea&apos;s deterioration. Instead of being an obstacle to normalisation on the Korean peninsula and the demilitarisation that would allow, China could be a key ally. The ailing Kim Jong-il is likely to visit Beijing soon and will still be received with due courtesy: Beijing has little difficulty understanding the desire for respect of a small Asian country that has built its identity on resisting imperialism. It is a harder sell in the west, but the result could be worth the effort."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/31/china-supports-obama-iran-sanctions", "publicationDate": "2010-03-31T21:37:13Z", "tags": ["Iran", "China", "United Nations", "Barack Obama", "Nuclear weapons", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The talks were complicated by other flashpoints in US-China relations, particularly American arms sales to Taiwan in January and Obama&apos;s meeting with the Dalai Lama in February."], "title": "China supports Barack Obama's call for new Iran sanctions", "article": "  Fresh sanctions against Iran moved closer yesterday, when China agreed to begin drafting a UN resolution imposing measures aimed at persuading Tehran to curb its nuclear programme.

The news of diplomatic progress towards sanctions coincided with a report that an Iranian nuclear scientist who went missing in Saudi Arabia last summer had been persuaded to defect by the CIA and had been resettled in the US. ABC News said the defection of Shahram Amiri was part of a &quot;long-planned&quot; CIA operation. &quot;The CIA reportedly approached the scientist in Iran through an intermediary who made an offer of resettlement on behalf of the US,&quot; the broadcaster said. It echoed earlier speculation that Amiri, an expert on radioactive isotopes at Malek Ashtar University in Tehran, had been persuaded to defect while on a pilgrimage to Mecca late last May or early June."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/01/china-iran-nuclear-sanctions", "publicationDate": "2010-04-01T12:37:24Z", "tags": ["Iran", "Nuclear weapons", "China", "US news", "Barack Obama", "United Nations", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["This was because of Chinese unhappiness over US arms sales to Taiwan and Obama&apos;s meeting with the Dalai Lama."], "title": "Iran holds talks with Beijing after China backs US call for sanctions", "article": "Iran&apos;s most senior nuclear official today arrived in China for talks, a day after Beijing agreed to begin drafting a UN resolution imposing sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear programme.

This was because of Chinese unhappiness over US arms sales to Taiwan and Obama&apos;s meeting with the Dalai Lama."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/01/iran-sanctions-china-un", "publicationDate": "2010-04-01T17:01:23Z", "tags": ["Iran", "China", "United Nations", "US foreign policy", "Nuclear weapons", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Taiwan is one example.", "So far, it seems that by backing Iran, the Chinese have provoked America into concluding a massive $6.4bn arms deal with Taiwan."], "title": "Sanctions will make Tehran take notice | Meir Javedanfar", "article": "After months of dilly-dallying, the Chinese government has finally decided to abandon its policy of &quot;negotiations only&quot; with regards to the Iranian nuclear programme. According to Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the UN, China has now officially agreed to enter talks with western powers about a new UN resolution against Iran, which aims to introduce new sanctions. True, the Chinese have said they are willing to talk. They have not said that they are going to agree to new sanctions, yet. Nevertheless, this is still a step forward for the EU and the US, as China was not willing to even discuss sanctions until very recently. The fact that Beijing has agreed to discuss these steps is bad news for Tehran. This is why Iran&apos;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, dispatched the top nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, to hold talks with the Chinese government. His hope is that it is not too late, and that he can find a way to persuade the Chinese to back away from the new UN resolution. A new oil deal here, a new gas deal there just might do the trick. It has worked before. It could do so again. However, Khamenei may find that whatever he offers is too little, too late. The reasons could be related to developments some of which he has control over, and others which he doesn&apos;t. First, there is his refusal to accept Obama&apos;s nuclear swap offer. This has made it more difficult to defend Iran&apos;s position in the international community. So has the recent exposure about a secret nuclear site in Qom. There is also the fact that Khamenei may be mistaken about the importance of his country to the Chinese. Iran is important, but not important enough for China to lose out in other areas, which are more vital for its national interests. Taiwan is one example. So far, it seems that by backing Iran, the Chinese have provoked America into concluding a massive $6.4bn arms deal with Taiwan. This undermines China&apos;s security and reduces its military superiority in south-east Asia. Then there is the question of North Korea and China&apos;s relations \u2013 something Khamenei has no influence over. However, events there have an impact on China&apos;s priorities, and the way the Iranian question fits into it them. North Korea may be an economic basket case; nevertheless, China&apos;s influence and relations with Pyongyang play an important part in its regional balance of power competition with the US. There is also the fact that China and North Korea share a border. What happens there could have direct consequences on China&apos;s national security interests. The recent mysterious sinking of the South Korean navy ship, which some believe was caused by a North Korean mine, has created new tensions with South Korea and its backers in the west. The Chinese will be needing their political capital to defuse a situation that is developing right on their doorstep. This could mean that at this very moment picking yet another fight against the west over Iran, a country thousands of miles away in the Middle East, may well be counterproductive for them and their need to resolve more pressing issues on their doorstep. Therefore the best China may be able to do for now is to warn Tehran that it should take the option of negotiations seriously. Attending talks about new sanctions and even backing them is a powerful way of doing that. The next question is: with China on board, is Khamenei likely to take notice of a new round of sanctions? That depends. If Iran is less than two years away from crossing the technological threshold which would enable it to assemble a bomb, then it&apos;s unlikely any amount of sanctions would stop Khamenei in his tracks. He may well decide that as Iran is close to making the bomb, it would be worth absorbing the pain. However, if Iran is five years away from reaching its goal, then sanctions \u2013 especially those targeting the regime and key parts of the economy under its ownership \u2013 may force the leadership to change its mind. For now, sanctions, especially targeted ones, are a necessity \u2013 not just for the nuclear programme, but also for the question of human rights in Iran. In its quest to survive, the Iranian government relies on human rights abuses more than the nuclear programme. To make Tehran take notice of the west&apos;s objections towards human rights abuses, the west needs to have leverage. Sanctions \u2013 especially those backed by the UN \u2013 provide the leverage needed to force the Iranian government to sit down and discuss this issue. Otherwise, there is no reason why Tehran would even bother to turn up to talk."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/01/us-china-extend-thaw-relations", "publicationDate": "2010-04-01T19:37:16Z", "tags": ["US news", "China", "Barack Obama", "Nuclear weapons", "World news", "Hu Jintao", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["A thaw in relations between the US and China appears to be under way after months of strain between the superpowers over arms sales to Taiwan, cybersecurity, the Dalai Lama and the trade imbalance.", "The visit by Hu was regarded as a litmus test for the state of relations by Washington, which feared he might boycott the summit in protest over arms sales to Taiwan and other causes of tension.", "Beijing tested Obama for weakness earlier this year, complaining more vociferously than normal about US arms sales to Taiwan and over the visit to the White House by the Dalai Lama."], "title": "China and US extend thaw as Hu Jintao confirms nuclear summit visit", "article": "A thaw in relations between the US and China appears to be under way after months of strain between the superpowers over arms sales to Taiwan, cybersecurity, the Dalai Lama and the trade imbalance. The Chinese foreign ministry said today that President Hu Jintao is to visit Washington on 12-13 April for a nuclear proliferation summit. The decision came less than 24 hours after it emerged that China, after months of stalling, had agreed to engage in negotiations on drafting UN sanctions against Iran. The visit by Hu was regarded as a litmus test for the state of relations by Washington, which feared he might boycott the summit in protest over arms sales to Taiwan and other causes of tension. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, hinted at a thaw today when he told reporters: &quot;I&apos;d like to reiterate that the undue disruption which China-US relations endured not long ago is in the interest of neither country and is not what we would like to see.&quot; Obama had kind words, too, for China when he met the Chinese ambassador to the US this week, and which were reported by the Chinese media as reflecting a positive change on the part of Washington. A White House spokesman, Bill Burton, welcomed Hu&apos;s attendance: &quot;We have an important relationship with China, one in which there are many issues of mutual concern that we work on together. But there also will be times where we disagree. I think this proves the point that despite those disagreements, we can work together on issues like nuclear proliferation.&quot; But there are potential problems looming, the biggest of which is whether the US treasury will cite China for manipulating its currency in its annual report on 15 April, days after Hu&apos;s visit. Asked if the visit would influence the treasury&apos;s decision whether to cite China for currency manipulation, Burton referred questions to the treasury. Analysts in Washington said today that China may have secured a promise from the US that it would not be cited as a quid pro quo for attending the summit and the deal on Iran. The apparent thaw marks another success for Obama, who has seen his fortunes improve on the domestic and foreign policy fronts since winning the protracted struggle to secure health reform in the US. Kenneth Lieberthal, a China specialist at the Washington-based Brookings Institution and a former special adviser on Asia in the Clinton White House, said the rough patch looked to be over. &quot;I have been expecting an uptick in relations and I think that is what we are seeing. I would give Obama credit,&quot; he said. He saw the move on Iran as a positive step, showing that China was prepared to engage in serious negotiations. &quot;They are making it clear they are now in the game,&quot; he said. &quot;They are very concerned about proliferation in the Middle East. The question is what they are going to do about it.&quot; As well as the visit in less than a fortnight, discussions are under way between Beijing and Washington about a state visit to the US by Hu, possibly in June. Obama, the most Pacific-orientated president yet, regards US relations with China as having the potential to define the 21st century, and reached out to Beijing last year, bringing accusations from Republicans that he was being too soft. Beijing tested Obama for weakness earlier this year, complaining more vociferously than normal about US arms sales to Taiwan and over the visit to the White House by the Dalai Lama. The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, embarrassed Beijing with a speech opposing Chinese internet censorship, an issue highlighted last week by Google&apos;s decision to in effect shut down its mainland China operation. The US, Britain, France and Germany have been trying since late last year to put together a package of sanctions against Iran, which they claim is intent on securing a nuclear weapons capability. But China, which has economic ties to Tehran, has proved reluctant to take punitive action. The shift took place during a telephone conference between the five countries, plus Russia, on Tuesday. Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the UN, told CNN: &quot;China has agreed to sit down and begin serious negotiations here in New York \u2026 as a first step toward getting the entire UN security council on board with a tough sanctions regime against Iran.&quot; But Qin today refused to confirm the move, saying only that &quot;all parties agreed to continue to maintain contact through various channels&quot;. Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations and director of the centre on American studies at Renmin University of China, said Beijing had made two major concessions to the US. &quot;This proves that the perception in the west that China is pursuing an aggressive foreign policy is wrong,&quot; he said. &quot;China&apos;s leaders are willing to give Obama the benefit of the doubt as they respect him, but whether Obama will reciprocate we have to wait and see.&quot; Victor Gao, director of the China National Association of International Studies, said: &quot;When Obama met the new Chinese ambassador to Washington, Zhang Yesui, this week he made remarks that made China more comfortable and they have put the US-China relationship back on track \u2026 but we are not out of the woods yet. If Congress takes protectionist action that stalls China&apos;s economy, it will be devastating not just for China, but for America and the rest of the world.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/apr/02/philips-chief-executive-kleisterlee-interview", "publicationDate": "2010-04-01T23:05:06Z", "tags": ["Manufacturing sector", "Global recession", "Business", "Europe"], "sentences": ["Working for a large corporation, he says, gives you ample opportunities \u2013 he has worked in manufacturing, sales and run the business in Taiwan and China.", "But I am hopeful we are getting there.&quot; The CV Born 1946, Germany Education Eindhoven Technical University, electronic engineering Career 1974-81, Philips Medical Systems, manufacturing management; 1981-86, Philips Professional Audio, general manager; 1986-94, Philips Components, industrial director; 1994-96, Philips Display Components, managing director; 1996-98, Philips Taiwan &amp; China, president; 1999-2000, Philips Components, chief executive; 2000\u201101, Philips, chief operations officer; 2001\u2013, Philips, chief executive Family Married with three children Other posts Daimler supervisory board"], "title": "Hard-wired: Kleisterlee is reinventing the inventive Dutch firm Philips", "article": "The year that Gerard Kleisterlee took over as chief executive of Philips, the company abruptly sank into the largest loss in its history. The Dutch firm, still best known for consumer electronics, had skirted around bankruptcy in the mid-1990s after a series of strategic blunders but recovered ground later in the decade. Then the dotcom bubble burst and the business, which was a leading player in semiconductors, went back into a downwards spiral. &quot;From a number of dimensions, 2000 had been a record year,&quot; Kleisterlee recalls, in heavily Dutch-inflected English. &quot;2001 and 2002 were also record years but in reverse order,&quot; he says with a quiet laugh. &quot;Then of course with the impairments and the write-downs on acquisitions we had done, we reported two years in a row, the biggest net income loss in the history of the company. That was my start. But from there on, it can only get better.&quot; Philips, which began as a lightbulb manufacturer in Eindhoven in 1891, has an illustrious past and has been behind some of the most significant advances in consumer technology. It brought to market the first rotary-head shaver in the 1930s and is still widely known for its Philishave brand. It introduced the first cassette tape; in 1972 launched the first video recorder, and in 1982 introduced the compact disc with Sony. The firm also played a pivotal role in developing the DVD and still gets a royalty for each disc and DVD player sold. But in recent decades, the unwieldy company has struggled to increase its revenues, along the way exiting markets including computers and recorded music with the sale of Polygram. It has also often failed to translate its world-beating technology into a commanding position in the market. &quot;We initially had a good share of the CD market, but then we moved down the path of CD interactive for example, which was basically a precursor to CD rewriteable or Playstation,&quot; Kleisterlee offers. &quot;Great technology, maybe too early, or not well positioned. So CD interactive never really made it into the marketplace as a successful application, even if the interactivity was a breakthrough in technology. That is an example of where we had the greatest technology but we were not able necessarily to turn it into the greatest market success,&quot; he says. When Kleisterlee, who trained as an engineer, began running the business, he embarked on the latest of many overhauls. Investors had become so used to Philips reshaping itself that it had become a &quot;restructuring play&quot;, he says. In a phrase that might ring familiar to workers at the BBC, he told the management board in his first big meeting as chief executive that they were &quot;too old, too male, too Dutch&quot;. Today, he says, &quot;I am the only Dutchman on the management board. I have a French chief financial officer, a German who does innovation and countries for me, an Italian is running lifestyle, an American is running healthcare and a Belgian is running lighting.&quot; The most significant decision was to sell the semiconductors business. The disposal met two aims. Kleisterlee, 63, wanted to unlock Philips from the highly cyclical semiconductors business and also to move further from components to finished products. He also quickly got out of making mobile phones, a disastrous foray by his predecessor, and now licenses the brand. BattlesAt the time, Kleisterlee says the business still regarded itself as a high-volume consumer electronics company. But much of that space has now been ceded to manufacturers from Asia and emerging markets, while margins have shrunk. &quot;We are picking our battles more and more.&quot; The company, he says, had hardly made a profit in televisions in the United States for 50 years, and now licenses its brand there, focusing instead on Europe and Latin America. The company has been refocused around three areas: consumer lifestyle, which includes televisions, shavers and electric toothbrushes; lighting, where it remains a world leader and sees growth in LED energy-saving bulbs; and healthcare, where it makes products such as CT scanners and home defibrillators. After nearly a decade of restructuring, the company has gone from 189,000 people and sales of \u20ac32bn, to 116,000 and sales of \u20ac23bn. Consumer remains the biggest part of the business but is also the part of the group that has struggled the most during the recession. It is healthcare, competing against Siemens and General Electric, where the company clearly sees the biggest potential for growth, with an ageing population in most developed markets and relatively high margins. Philips has spent \u20ac10bn on acquisitions in the past few years, much in healthcare, including its largest to date, the $5bn takeover of Respironics in 2007, a firm that treats sleep apnoea (a condition that causes people to stop breathing during the night). Kleisterlee struggles to make sense of the three divisions, talking broadly about how they all touch the consumer, and about health and wellbeing, before admitting that one can spend too much in &quot;intellectual rationalisation&quot;, and that he might be happy with what is &quot;just a nice portfolio&quot;. Among other changes, he also placed a stronger emphasis on marketing, appointing a chief marketing officer, in the hope that the business might strengthen its branding and better translate its technology into market share. The slogan \u2013 sense and simplicity, which surely owes something to Jane Austen \u2013 was introduced in 2005. Kleisterlee, an imposing business-like presence with ice-blue eyes, has much invested in making a success of the company. Not only did he join straight from national service, but his father had spent his entire career at Philips before him. Working for a large corporation, he says, gives you ample opportunities \u2013 he has worked in manufacturing, sales and run the business in Taiwan and China. But in interviews, he also points out that in post-war Europe, the emphasis was on getting a steady job for life. Doubling profits  The headquarters of the business moved from Eindhoven in 2001, and remains in a small cluster of towers in Amstel, a quiet suburb of Amsterdam. It is not yet clear whether the latest reinvention of Philips has paid off. After getting the portfolio into the shape he wanted, Kleisterlee set targets to get the business growing again. Then came the global recession, and the target of doubling profits by 2010 was abandoned. In 2009, sales were down 11% year on year \u2013 its lighting division depends heavily on the construction market, while consumer electronics was hit by the slump in consumer demand. Kleisterlee talks perhaps less with exasperation than as someone used to things not going as planned. &quot;We set a few goals for ourselves, and then comes the crisis, and we said, God, we were getting in shape and now comes the crisis and we can&apos;t show [the improvement].&quot; The share price in the past year has risen from \u20ac15.59 to \u20ac25.33, but still trades below the level when he started. But he compares Philips&apos; performance in this recession with the years after he joined and finds grounds for optimism. While Philips plunged into the red after the tech bubble burst, it still achieved profit of \u20ac424m last year in a far harsher environment. Could the firm be ready to grow after decades of stagnation? &quot;I definitely have that feeling; of course, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. You have to unlearn a lot of things in a company that has been focused on risk containment, because so many things went wrong over past decades that almost the institutional instinct, the Pavlovian reaction, is always to focus on the downside. You have to create a culture where people are motivated to go for the upside. But I am hopeful we are getting there.&quot; The CV Born 1946, Germany Education Eindhoven Technical University, electronic engineering Career 1974-81, Philips Medical Systems, manufacturing management; 1981-86, Philips Professional Audio, general manager; 1986-94, Philips Components, industrial director; 1994-96, Philips Display Components, managing director; 1996-98, Philips Taiwan &amp; China, president; 1999-2000, Philips Components, chief executive; 2000\u201101, Philips, chief operations officer; 2001\u2013, Philips, chief executive Family Married with three children Other posts Daimler supervisory board"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/04/china-blocks-bob-dylan-gigs", "publicationDate": "2010-04-04T10:41:47Z", "tags": ["Bob Dylan", "China", "Music", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["China&apos;s ministry of culture, which vets planned concerts by overseas artists, appeared wary of Dylan&apos;s past as an icon of the counterculture movement, said Jeffrey Wu, of the Taiwan-based promoters Brokers Brothers Herald.", "The singer, who plays around 100 concerts a year on his Never Ending Tour, had hoped to extend a multi-city Japanese leg with concerts in Beijing, Shanghai, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong.", "&quot;With Beijing and China ruled out, it was not possible for him just to play concerts in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan,&quot; he said."], "title": "China blocks Bob Dylan gigs", "article": "Aged 68 and almost half a century past the zenith of his angry, protest-song youth, Bob Dylan must almost have forgotten what it was like to be deemed a threat to society.

The pioneer in developing hi-tech handheld organisers has called in Goldman Sachs and San Francisco-based Qatalyst Partners to look for a buyer and is seeking bids this week, according to a report by Bloomberg News that sent the company&apos;s much maligned shares up by 17%. The move follows disappointing sales of Palm&apos;s latest range of Pre and Pixi smartphones, which reached shops last year. Events are likely to be closely watched by the U2 rock star Bono, whose investment firm Elevation Partners pumped $460m (\u00a3300m) into Palm in 2007 and 2008, giving it a stake of roughly 30%. Founded in 1992 by neurologist Jeff Hawkins, Palm shot to prominence with its Palm Pilot devices, which allowed users to write on a screen using an electronic pen using a simplified graffiti language. Initially simply electronic diaries and address books, Palm&apos;s products evolved to incorporate phones and web browsers. On its flotation in 2000, Palm&apos;s market value rocketed to an astonishing $53bn, exceeding the likes of McDonald&apos;s and General Motors. In recent years, Palm has struggled to find the marketing punch to land blows on bigger players such as Apple and Research in Motion. Experts say US mobile phone partners failed to push Palm products particularly heavily to the public, despite decent reviews in the technology press. &quot;The problem is they just don&apos;t have enough in the way of resources,&quot; said Charles Wolf, a technology analyst at stockbroker Needham &amp; Co. &quot;It&apos;s unfortunate because the company has reasonably good products.&quot; Palm&apos;s WebOS operating system is considered the company&apos;s most valuable asset. Rumoured buyers include hardware firms such as Taiwan&apos;s HTC and the China&apos;s Lenovo. Wolf suggested interest could also come from Nokia or RIM, who could view Palm&apos;s easy-to-use software as attractive in competing with the iPhone and with Android, which powers Google&apos;s phones: &quot;Palm&apos;s software is in the same class as the iPhone and Android.&quot; Palm declined to comment. Its chief executive, Jon Rubinstein, acknowledged last month that its performance had been &quot;very disappointing&quot; following a net loss of $18.5m for the three months to February. Palm&apos;s shares, which were changing hands for $13 in January, perked up by 87 cents to $6.03 during early trading today, giving it a market capitalisation of just over $1bn. The company has proved a disappointment for Elevation Partners, co-founded by Bono, which specialises in new media and entertainment and bet on a revival of Palm&apos;s fortunes. Elevation began investing when Palm&apos;s stock was at $8.50, though the firm&apos;s injection of funds into Palm has been largely in return for convertible preference shares with a degree of protection against losses."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/apr/15/scotch-whisky-global-recession-exports", "publicationDate": "2010-04-15T11:24:50Z", "tags": ["Food & drink industry", "Food & drink", "Scotland", "Whisky", "Business", "Life and style"], "sentences": ["Emrys Inker, director of corporate affairs at the Edrington Group, the privately owned distillers that make Macallan and Highland Park malt whiskies and the Famous Grouse blend, said the firm had focused heavily on the US, Taiwan and South Korea."], "title": "Global recession fails to quench thirst for Scotch whisky", "article": "Exports of Scotch whisky reached record levels last year despite the global recession, with worldwide sales breaking through the \u00a33bn barrier for the second successive year. The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) said sales volumes of both blended and malt whiskies had increased by 4% in 2009, with sales buoyant in France, the United States, Brazil, Venezuela and South Africa, despite a slow start to the year blamed on weak consumer confidence and &quot;destocking&quot; by retailers. The sales increase, which saw the cash value of those exports rise by 3% to \u00a33.13bn, have buoyed Scotland&apos;s most significant export after poor UK sales last year. The SWA said domestic sales \u2013 based on the release of whisky from bonded warehouses \u2013 fell 11% to 92m bottles. Last year&apos;s whisky exports also contrast strongly with gloomy figures for overall export figures for Scottish industries, which fell by 10% last year despite rallying in the last quarter of 2009 by 2.9%. Metals and textiles, furs and leathers were the heaviest hit, falling by 24% and 17.4%. Scottish businesses also appear to be slower to emerge from the recession, which began later than in other parts of the UK, making them heavily dependent on the slow increase in exports. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said that a sustained recovery was still eluding many industries, partly due to the intense winter, VAT returning to 17.5%, and a fall in public sector capital projects spending by the Scottish government. The SWA used the contrast in overseas and domestic sales to repeat their demand for a significant and &quot;long overdue&quot; reform in the UK&apos;s excise duty system after the election. Duty on whisky has grown by nearly 22% since the beginning of 2008, it said, and suffers discrimination compared to beers and wine. It is pressing for all drinks to be taxed on the basis of their alcohol content. Paul Walsh, its chairman, said: &quot;Scotch whisky distillers have delivered record exports in the face of a global economic downturn. It is an impressive performance, underscoring the importance of Scotch whisky to the UK economy. The industry is continuing to invest and sustain its efforts to secure fair access to export markets. We look to the next UK government to work with us to build on Scotch whisky&apos;s success in the future.&quot; The US remains the biggest single importer of whisky, up 13% to \u00a3419m, while southern America, particularly Brazil, had seen 17% growth chiefly due to intensive sales efforts by global firms such as Diageo. Europe and Asia were more troubled, however, with total sales falling 1% on the continent to \u00a31.26bn and falling by 9% to Asia, down to \u00a3543m. There were signs that in South Korea sales would grow this year, while exports to Japan rose by 1% in 2009, for the first time since 2001. Emrys Inker, director of corporate affairs at the Edrington Group, the privately owned distillers that make Macallan and Highland Park malt whiskies and the Famous Grouse blend, said the firm had focused heavily on the US, Taiwan and South Korea. It had appointed its own sales and distribution teams in Asia and the US, where it sponsored whisky nosing and tasting events, and had a joint promotions initiative with Jim Beam bourbon in 24 markets. It has particularly pushed more expensive &quot;expressions&quot; of its premium Macallan malt. &quot;The European market has been very difficult for us and all other whisky companies,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ve probably been making more progress in the Asian markets and also the US has proven to be robust, probably at the premium end of the malt whisky market.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/apr/27/notebooks-netbooks-suppliers-intel-atom", "publicationDate": "2010-04-27T13:25:40Z", "tags": ["Intel", "Computing", "Technology", "Acer"], "sentences": ["In this case, the Taiwan-based DigiTimes has covered the disagreement about which company shipped the most portables in Market watchers differ with the leader of notebook brands for 1Q10 (a story that will soon be available to subscribers only)."], "title": "The top notebook suppliers and the future of netbooks", "article": "Either HP or Acer led the market in notebook shipments in the first quarter of this year, but the main two market trackers -- Gartner and IDC -- appear to differ about which company took the top spot. IDC apparently thinks Hewlett-Packard did it by shipping 9.5 million units against Acer&apos;s 8.65m, while Gartner has Acer pipping HP by 9.5m to 9.47m. Neither Gartner nor IDC makes a habit of revealing numbers for specific types of product (PC shipments includes desktops, laptops, netbooks etc, but not servers) or of listing firms outside the top five. They have the numbers, of course, but they charge for them. However, a certain amount of bragging goes on, which can make some of them available, though they&apos;re not guaranteed to be reliable. In this case, the Taiwan-based DigiTimes has covered the disagreement about which company shipped the most portables in Market watchers differ with the leader of notebook brands for 1Q10 (a story that will soon be available to subscribers only).

Apple -- 1.85m8. Samsung -- 1.72m9. Sony -- 1.68m All but one of those companies ships netbooks as well as notebooks, and three companies seem to have done particularly well out of them: Acer, Asus and Samsung. They could therefore be hit if the netbook market declines. At the moment, it seems the netbook market may have reached a plateau. In discussing its latest quarterly results, earlier this month, Intel noted that Atom sales dipped by 19% to $355m over the previous (Christmas) quarter, though they were up by 62% year-on-year. But as I commented at the time, the netbook market could be boosted by the arrival of dual-core Atom chips that remove many of the performance limitations (Dual-core Atoms coming as Intel aims for the first &quot;netbook refresh cycle&quot;), and some PC manufacturers could also have hits with tablet versions and other form factors -- Samsung, for example, has done OK with its Q1. The new system-on-a-chip Atom design codenamed Tunnel Creek could also have an impact: it&apos;s cheaper and uses less power, which should encourage more innovative form factors. Note: I expect that tablets running Windows 7 will count in the rankings but Apple&apos;s iPad tablet will not. The iPad is a media consumption device like the iPod Touch or Sony PlayStation Portable. There are now lots of devices -- including smart phones and games consoles -- that are not personal computers, even though they are personal, and compute."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/apr/29/boobquake-earthquake-immodest-dress-iran", "publicationDate": "2010-04-29T13:08:33Z", "tags": ["Religion", "Islam", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "US news", "World news", "Iran"], "sentences": ["&quot;Aha!&quot; you counter, &quot;but wasn&apos;t there a 6.5 magnitude earthquake in Taiwan that day?&quot; Yes, you&apos;re absolutely correct.", "So my apologies to the Daily Mail, The View, and everyone else who dozed off while learning about probabilities in school \u2013 the Taiwan earthquake was good for headlines, but not statistically significant."], "title": "What I learned from Boobquake | Jennifer McCreight", "article": "What turned into a viral media extravaganza began as a humorous science experiment. On Monday 19 April, I had just read Iranian cleric Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi&apos;s assertion that &quot;Many women who do not dress modestly ... lead young men astray, corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society, which (consequently) increases earthquakes.&quot; Amused and annoyed by his ludicrous statement, I suggested on my blog that women dress immodestly on 26 April to test his claims. Tongue-in-cheek, I dubbed the project &quot;Boobquake&quot;. When I first published that fateful blogpost, I thought it would only be enjoyed by my friends and thousand readers. It ended in almost a million unique visits to my blog, thousands of emails, and coverage by CNN, the BBC, and (more importantly to a liberal nerdy college student) the Colbert Report. People around the world engaged in intense debate about how it affected women&apos;s rights, Muslims, and Iranians. To be honest, global discussion and awareness were not my original goal \u2013 that wasn&apos;t even feasible in my mind. Though I&apos;m glad it happened, I also want to stress the original message behind Boobquake. As a scientist and a sceptic, I firmly believe that we should test claims people make, especially when they&apos;re ridiculous. And as an atheist, I don&apos;t think supernatural beliefs are exempt from this questioning. Because Sedighi&apos;s hypothesis was testable, how could we not investigate further? Wouldn&apos;t it have been fascinating if we did find out tight pants and cleavage controlled natural disasters? That would surely be worthy of Nature or Science, a great thing for a young scientist like myself to have on her resume. I quickly went to work. After recruiting over a 100,000 women somewhat accidentally thanks to Facebook and Twitter, we dressed in our most immodest outfits on the 26 April. And on the 27th, I crunched the numbers.     Figure two \u2013 the overall distribution of the magnitudes of earthquakes on Boobquake.    Each data point (from the USGS Earthquake website) represents the total number of earthquakes per day (measured in GMT) going back to 5 February (figure one). That red square is Boobquake. As you can see qualitatively, our provocative dress didn&apos;t really seem to affect the frequency of earthquakes. There were 47 earthquakes on the 26th, which falls well within the 95% confidence interval for number of earthquakes (about 0 to 148). &quot;Aha!&quot; you counter, &quot;but wasn&apos;t there a 6.5 magnitude earthquake in Taiwan that day?&quot; Yes, you&apos;re absolutely correct. Except that earthquakes between 6.0 and 6.9 magnitude happen, on average, 134 times a year. That means we had about a 37% probability of an earthquake of that magnitude happening on Boobquake just due to chance alone \u2013 hardly an improbable event that needs to be attributed to an angry deity. So my apologies to the Daily Mail, The View, and everyone else who dozed off while learning about probabilities in school \u2013 the Taiwan earthquake was good for headlines, but not statistically significant. But just to be safe, I also looked at the overall distribution of the magnitudes of earthquakes on Boobquake (figure two). These samples span from the entirety of the event \u2013 midnight at the earliest time zone to midnight at the last time. The box indicates the first and third quartiles (within which 50% of the data points fall). Not only did all of the earthquakes on Boobquake fall within the normal range of magnitudes, but the mean magnitude actually decreased slightly! Maybe God actually approves of hot pants. Obviously this study had its flaws. To really be scientifically rigorous, we&apos;d have to increase our sample size by repeating Boobquake on other days. We didn&apos;t have a control planet of women covered head to toe, and we didn&apos;t have a good way to quantify how much we increased immodesty (what&apos;s the unit of immodesty anyway? Intensity of red on blushing nuns?) Maybe we didn&apos;t lead men astray enough, or maybe God is just biding his time before crumbling my apartment in a freak Indiana earthquake. Even though Boobquake wasn&apos;t perfect, it still was a success. Some people created counter-protests like Brainquake,&quot; thinking that my idea lacked real substance because of indecent male detractors. But the vast majority of people \u2013 including earthquake researchers, feminists, and many Iranians \u2013 thanked me for this exercise in scepticism. The boob joke probably made it popular, but hopefully the smarts will make it memorable."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/apr/30/nikita-mikhalkov-vladimir-putin", "publicationDate": "2010-04-30T10:58:47Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "World cinema", "Cannes film festival", "Russia", "World news", "Vladimir Putin", "Europe"], "sentences": ["Hou Hsiao-hsien, for years, flew the flag for Taiwan at international festivals: a state-sanctioned film-maker in all but name.", "But Hou was a perennial outsider, a working-class kid in the mostly privileged world of Taiwanese cinema, and his historicism was as subtle as his technique was sophisticated; you could hardly accuse films such as A City of Sadness or Good Men, Good Women (which deal, respectively, with the 28 February 1947 massacre and the White Terror) of nationalist breast-beating; on the contrary, they are gravely beautiful, quietly profound works of art."], "title": "Nikita Mikhalkov has been Burnt By the Sun of state patronage | Shane Danielsen", "article": "To be truly effective, James Joyce observed, the artist requires three things: silence, exile and cunning. But James Joyce never made movies. And while cunning is almost a genetic necessity in the world of film-making, the pursuit of exile will see you consigned, like Ovid, to the farthest reaches of empire. But there&apos;s also a danger in being too clubby. Case in point: Russian director Nikita Mikhalkov, who has long enjoyed a seat at the big table, thanks in no small part to his reportedly close friendship with Vladimir Putin. Unsurprising, then, that much of his recent work has been prone to grandiloquent celebrations of Russian nationalism; most notoriously, there was the queasy moment in 1998&apos;s The Barber of Siberia when he halted the film for a few minutes to depict a lavish military parade overseen by Tsar Alexander III \u2013 a role essayed, with characteristic modesty, by the film-maker himself. When I lectured at Moscow&apos;s VGIK film school in late 2006, I was startled to find that the first question the students asked me was what I thought of Mikhalkov. Was he a good film-maker? Was he respected outside Russia? The same question was repeated, with identical urgency, at subsequent lectures in St Petersburg and Rostov-on-Don. Finally, talking with a group of students after a lecture, I asked why this matter was of such pressing concern: &quot;Because we hate him,&quot; they hissed \u2013 though quietly, so as not to attract the attention of their professor. But now &quot;the Russian Spielberg&quot; (as his IMDb biography claims) has come a cropper. His latest film, Burnt By the Sun 2 \u2013 a sequel to the 1994 best foreign-language film Oscar-winner, soon to make its international premiere at Cannes \u2013 has flopped at the Russian box office. As Luke Harding noted this week, there appears to be a perception in Russia that Mikhalkov, these days, is less a film-maker than an apparatchik, an instrument of the state. And his film&apos;s vision of the great patriotic war, with its noble, heroic Soviets and swinish Germans, will hardly be remembered for its even-handedness. This has hardly hurt other productions: from Fyodor Bondarchuk&apos;s 2006 blockbuster 9th Company, to Vladimir Khotinenko&apos;s 2007 costume epic 1612: A Chronicle of the Time of Troubles (financed by the oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, who also bankrolls the Moscow-based Foundation for the Support of Patriotic Cinema), there has been an ugly, triumphalist strain in Russian mainstream cinema for much of the past decade. And some of these films have fared very well at the domestic box office. But something about Mikhalkov&apos;s chummy proximity to power, combined with the pomposity of his methods, has clearly failed to strike the desired chord with the public. Worryingly, even Putin didn&apos;t attend the premiere at the Kremlin. Back in the day, it was so much easier. Under the communists, a fortunate few eastern bloc film-makers enjoyed the privileges of state support: big budgets (by the standard of the day), ready resources. For some, like Hungary&apos;s Miklos Jancso, it was instrumental in shaping their aesthetic: the film-maker today admits that his &quot;high style&quot; of the 1960s and 70s \u2013 those intricate tracking shots across the Hungarian plains, replete with dozens and, in the case of 1967&apos;s The Red and the White, hundreds of extras \u2013 would not have been possible with anything but the full co-operation of the state&apos;s film department. Yet Jancso&apos;s reputation has endured, because notwithstanding their provenance, his communist-era films were remarkable enough to outlast the regimes that sponsored them. They are elusive, ambiguous, open to many possible readings \u2013 and therefore, cannot be dismissed simply as products of their time. Their politics runs second to their art. Meanwhile, other film-makers \u2013 in lockstep with power, flattering power&apos;s vision of itself \u2013 have been forgotten. Consider, too, the case of Giuseppe Tornatore&apos;s $35m (\u00a323m) Baar\u00eca, which opened last September&apos;s Venice film festival \u2013 but remains, so far, without UK distribution. Set in Sicily, and packed with Italian stars (Michele Placido, Monica Bellucci, Enrico Lo Verso), it proved an expensive, lavishly-staged disaster. Vulgar, buffoonish, grotesquely sentimental, Baar\u00eca managed to be simultaneously salt-of-the-earth \u2013 a &quot;people&apos;s epic&quot; \u2013 and an encapsulation of the very aesthetic that Silvio Berlusconi has brought, for over two decades, to the nation&apos;s television screens, the mirror he has held to his country. It&apos;s a film absolutely of its time and place \u2013 and so one should not have been altogether surprised when Silvio himself proclaimed it &quot;a masterpiece&quot;, and declared that it was the duty of every Italian to go see it, a recommendation that makes even more sense when you realise it was made by Medusa Film, his own production company. Good film-making and politics are hardly irreconcilable. But the question of the film-maker&apos;s own relationship to authority is more problematic. Hou Hsiao-hsien, for years, flew the flag for Taiwan at international festivals: a state-sanctioned film-maker in all but name. But Hou was a perennial outsider, a working-class kid in the mostly privileged world of Taiwanese cinema, and his historicism was as subtle as his technique was sophisticated; you could hardly accuse films such as A City of Sadness or Good Men, Good Women (which deal, respectively, with the 28 February 1947 massacre and the White Terror) of nationalist breast-beating; on the contrary, they are gravely beautiful, quietly profound works of art. You can, or could, live very nicely as the flag-bearer for your country. (As Derek Malcolm once observed, in this newspaper: &quot;As the outstanding Greek director, [Theo Angelopoulos] has had his every whim granted over the last half of his career by the cultural wing of the country&apos;s government.&quot;) And I have no doubt that Mikhalkov (and Angelopoulos, for that matter) dine very well, and among notable, if not exactly distinguished company. But they are also a handy illustration of the danger of cosying up to authority, their early talent dissolving into pomposity and self-indulgence. It&apos;s hard to keep in mind, when you&apos;re being flattered by the rich and powerful, but your true place, as an artist, is not at the table; it&apos;s outside the window, looking in."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/30/shanghai-world-expo-2010-launch", "publicationDate": "2010-04-30T13:01:33Z", "tags": ["China", "Human rights", "Freedom of speech", "Art and design", "Culture", "Architecture", "World news", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["&quot;Shanghai&apos;s hosting of the World Expo is the pride of all Chinese people,&quot; Hu told a delegation from Taiwan, according to China&apos;s state media."], "title": "Shanghai Expo 2010: Tight security as city prepares for opening", "article": "After eight years preparing, Shanghai is launching the biggest Expo so far with a lavish show of lights and fireworks.

Celebrities expected to perform at the opening include actor Jackie Chan \u2013 ubiquitous at big Chinese events \u2013 as well as pianist Lang Lang and tenor Andrea Bocelli, who also sang at the opening for the Beijing Olympics. The tradition of Expos and World Fairs began with Great Exhibition of 1851 in London, but has lost much of its lustre in recent years. China is hoping to breathe new life into it. It is spending $4.2bn (\u00a32.7bn) to host the Expo. A reported $45bn has been spent overhauling Shanghai for the event \u2013 more than Beijing spent for the Olympics \u2013 with new airport terminals, hundreds of miles of subway line and a revamp of its historic waterfront, the Bund. With security precautions at their height tonight, thousands of police are on duty, guards have been stationed at thousands of bus stops and 8,000 firefighters are on alert. But campaigners say the event has also brought a crackdown on dissent. The Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) network said officials have detained, harassed or placed under surveillance activists, intellectuals and petitioners across Shanghai and surrounding areas. One target has been those who have protested over the forced demolition of their homes to make way for the Expo site. According to official estimates, 18,000 households have been knocked down. In a statement the CHRD urged: &quot;The government must stop the practice of placing &apos;troublemaking&apos; individuals under surveillance and restricting their movements on &apos;sensitive&apos; occasions. These individuals should not be punished for exercising their freedom of expression or their right to defend human rights.&quot; Similar pressure was put on activists ahead of the Olympics. Last month 6,000 people were detained in Shanghai in what officials described as a drive against &quot;theft, gambling, prostitution and selling pornographic materials&quot;. In the runup to the event officials have also cleared many vendors off the streets and even ordered residents not to wear their pyjamas outside their homes, as some have become used to doing. The Expo site, which spans both banks of the Huangpu river, is more than twice the size of Monaco at 5.3 sq km (1,310 acres).

The impact of the bill signed into law in Arizona last Friday is not limited to the players on one team. The international players on the [Arizona] Diamondbacks work and, with their families, reside in Arizona from April through September or October. In addition, during the season, hundreds of international players on opposing major league teams travel to Arizona to play the Diamondbacks. And, the spring training homes of half of the 30 major league teams are now in Arizona. All of these players, as well as their families, could be adversely affected, even though their presence in the United States is legal. Each of them must be ready to prove, at any time, his identity and the legality of his being in Arizona to any state or local official with suspicion of his immigration status. This law also may affect players who are US citizens but are suspected by law enforcement of being of foreign descent. The Major League Baseball Players Association opposes this law as written. We hope that the law is repealed or modified promptly. If the current law goes into effect, the MLBPA will consider additional steps necessary to protect the rights and interests of our members.  In response, the Diamondbacks&apos; Ken Kendricks issued his own statement:  We ... share the same concerns of the impact Arizona&apos;s immigration law will have on major league players. However, we believe the federal government should act swiftly to address the immigration issue once and for all. We certainly are well aware of the struggles our state has due to federal inaction on illegal immigration. The fallout of recent state legislation has a direct impact on many of our players, employees and fans in Arizona, not to mention our local businesses, many of which are corporate partners of ours. Unfortunately, this whole situation is sad and disappointing for all of us who are associated with the Arizona Diamondbacks.  With public fallout like this, the time may soon be ripe for the US government to have another attempt at major immigration reform."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/02/liverpool-chelsea-premier-league-live", "publicationDate": "2010-05-02T10:22:56Z", "tags": ["Premier League", "Liverpool", "Chelsea", "Football", "Sport"], "sentences": ["&quot;I&apos;m watching from Taiwan with my Taiwanese girlfriend and asked her to translate the words, thinking they&apos;d be the Carlsberg brand name in Chinese,&quot; writes James Whyte."], "title": "Liverpool v Chelsea - as it happened | Scott Murray", "article": " Tick, tock, tick tock. What&apos;s the time? It&apos;s Dignity O&apos;Clock!  And what better hour to retrieve a couple of slivers of the stuff? After a dismal week of idle speculation, God knows we need some. So fans of Liverpool who want their team to lose, and managers of Manchester United who feel the need to lecture other clubs about putting in a shift when there&apos;s nothing left to play for, are invited to pipe down. Have some self-respect, will you, for Christ&apos;s sake.  Dignity scrap #1: If Liverpool don&apos;t want United to have won the English league more times than them, they&apos;d do well to win another title themselves sometime.  Dignity scrap #2: Alex Ferguson may like to check Liverpool&apos;s &quot;history&quot; once again, and note that United would already have their 19th title thanks to the Anfield club&apos;s kind efforts, had they bothered to take advantage of John Barnes and Jamie Redknapp&apos;s largesse back in 1995. And it&apos;s not Liverpool who&apos;ve been fielding half-arsed end-of-season selections that have in recent years piqued the Uniteds of Sheffield and Newcastle, now, is it.  Everyone can shut up talking at: 1.30pm.  Having said that, it&apos;s slightly disappointing that Rafael Benitez hasn&apos;t fielded 11 kids, with a view to spending the entire 90 minutes sauntering up and down the touchline with one hand in his pocket, the other flicking nonchalant V signs, just to see how it all came down in a press conference up in Sunderland later on: Reina, Mascherano, Kyrgiakos, Carragher, Agger, Gerrard, Lucas, Maxi, Aquilani, Benayoun, Kuyt.Subs: Cavalieri, Babel, Ngog, Degen, El Zhar, Ayala, Pacheco.  Anyone remember the potential champions in all of this? Cech, Ivanovic, Terry, Alex, Ashley Cole, Lampard, Ballack, Malouda, Kalou, Drogba, Anelka.Subs: Hilario, Joe Cole, Zhirkov, Paulo Ferreira, Deco, Sturridge, Belletti.  Referee: Alan Wiley (Staffordshire)  Fair Points, Well Made dept. (1) &quot;As a Liverpool fan,&quot; begins Patrick McGovern, &quot;I am finding that a studied indifference is the most dignified attitude I can muster. Evidently this is not quite working, since I am following your MBM and actually participating in it. However, I would definitely NOT celebrate a last-minute winner from Chelsea, despite what that pr*ck in the Betfair front room may say.&quot; Just to be clear, do you mean &quot;prick in the Betfair front room&quot;? There certainly are pricks in that Betfair front room, so I&apos;m assuming you mean &quot;prick in the Betfair front room&quot;. (2) &quot;Actually I&apos;m pretty sure Sheffield Utd were annoyed when Liverpool put out a reserve team and lost 1-0 to Fulham in 2007,&quot; writes Liam Ellis, doing his level best to jigger my whole introduction. &quot;Isn&apos;t that why Neil Warnock said he hoped Benitez lost the Champions League final in Athens? Or was he just being his usual lovely self when he said that?&quot; (3) &quot;Fergie is going to be furious when he sees the Liverpool team sheet and realizes that those are Liverpool&apos;s best players,&quot; quips Ben Bamford, who&apos;ll be here all week showcasing his gentle pint-and-a-pie stand-up style, unless he gets the call from Michael McIntyre&apos;s roadshow people.  The teams are out ... and they&apos;re running about. It&apos;s Dignity O&apos;Clock! Chelsea kick off, aiming for the Kop in the first half. This match, therefore, is set up just how Liverpool like it. [Disclaimer: this match is not really set up just how Liverpool like it]  41 sec: Lampard has a pop for the top-right corner from 25 yards. It&apos;s wide right, but full of Chelsea&apos;s intent.  1 min: John Terry is getting pelters, even more so than usual.  3 min: Maxi has a lash from distance, the ball deflected out for a corner. Then Mascherano sends in a daisycutter; that&apos;s also deflected out for a corner. Kuyt flings in a couple of crosses from the left. Why isn&apos;t he in the area? Maybe it&apos;s not Kuyt. Anyway, Liverpool are up for this too. A really lively start.  6 min: Liverpool are wearing attention-seeking shirts, by the way, with their outgoing sponsor Carlsberg&apos;s logo rendered in Chinese script. Didn&apos;t Chelsea come to Anfield in the John Hollins era with Chinese sponsors, causing Jimmy Greaves to almost self-combust with excitement? I could possibly be dreaming that. Nothing much is happening.  7 min: Malouda goes on an insouciant sashay down the centre, Carragher and Kurgiakos backing off. Eventually the Chelsea man takes a low shot towards the bottom-right corner, but Reina has it covered and lets it fly wide.  9 min: Maxi is this close to sending Gerrard free down the right with a cheeky backheel. The ball&apos;s intercepted, Chelsea flooding upfield and feeding the ball to Anelka, who whaps in a firm low effort from 20-odd yards. Reina smothers it before it gets anywhere near the bottom-left corner. This game is very open.  11 min: Gerrard picks up a throw-in from the right and feeds the ball inside to the increasingly impressive Aquilani, who hits a rising screamer which clips the top of the crossbar. Not sure whether Cech would have got to that had it found the top-left corner. A cracking effort.  14 min: Liverpool pass it around a lot, getting absolutely nowhere, an ersatz Arsenal. &quot;For all English football&apos;s faults,&quot; begins Justin Kavanagh, puffing his chest out and holding onto his lapels, &quot;at least most people still believe in the possibility of a result for Liverpool today, however slim. I wonder how many Italians really believe that Lazio are going to bother against Inter today, to do their city rivals Roma a similar favour?&quot;  18 min: You know how I hinted this was free-flowing? Well. Sorry. &quot;I don&apos;t think Liverpool&apos;s shirts do say Carlsberg in Chinese,&quot; writes Alison MacPherson. &quot;I think it says &apos;Eff Off United&apos;.&quot; You&apos;re not totally fluent in Mandarin, are you? I&apos;d like to see you hail a taxi in Beijing.  21 min: Malouda lumps a long ball forward for Anelka, but he&apos;s offside. Chelsea can&apos;t get anything together. Like Liverpool earlier, they&apos;re seeing a fair bit of the ball, but not managing to do much with it. &quot;Typical of the lefty Guardian is the the unique Stalinist scores service you provide,&quot; moans Colin Flint, who may not have noticed that the paper has thrown in its lot with centre-right toff Nick Clegg. &quot;Refreshing the page often leads to some or all of the scores disappearing; effectively air-brushing bad news out of history. The idea has potential. Gulags for goalies, purges for players, etc.&quot; There&apos;s nothing like a pogrom to spice up a bit of jovial football-based banter on the day of the Lord, is there.  24 min: Chelsea win a free kick out on the left. Lampard ever-so-kindly swings it straight into Reina&apos;s hands. There really is not much happening here, though Anfield is remaining lively despite it all, especially the away section.  25 min: Benayoun has a lash from 30 yards. It&apos;s 30 yards wide right at best.  27 min: Malouda is booked for crumping his studs onto the business end of Mascherano&apos;s tig. Ooyah, oof, that&apos;s gotta hurt.  29 min: What a chance for Aquilani, who is set free straight into the area, just to the left of goal, by a beautifully dinked pass down the inside-left channel by Maxi. He should whack it first time, with only Cech to beat, but hesitates, and is bustled off the ball by Ivanovic. Chelsea&apos;s hearts were in their mouths then.  32 min: Gerrard bustles down the right, but his cross is too high for Maxi in the centre. Chelsea have retreated into their shell a bit since that Aquilani chance, perhaps feared of pushing their luck at the back. Problem is, they still need to win. &quot;Is Ray Wilkins getting fatter, and does this have a negative effect on the players?&quot; wonders John Martin. He probably is carrying a bit more timber, but it&apos;ll only become a problem for the players if one is idly standing nearby and gets drawn into his gravitational orbit and effectively become satellites.  33 min: ALEX FERGUSON ISN&apos;T GOING TO APPRECIATE THIS ABJECT FARCE, NOT ONE BIT. Liverpool 0-1 Chelsea. Steven Gerrard, captain of Liverpool Football Club, plays a suicidal blind backpass down his own inside-left channel. Drogba, lolling around in the centre, pounces, rounds the advancing Reina on the outside, and strokes the ball into the gaping net. Oh me, oh my, you couldn&apos;t have scripted that. You may possibly hear about it again.  36 min:  Gerrard tries to make amends by swinging in a free kick from the right, but it&apos;s just over the lurking Kuyt&apos;s head and nestles in Cech&apos;s arms.  38 min:  Liverpool are all over the shop now. First Cole rampages down the left and feeds Lampard in the centre; his shot is just wide of goal (and maybe took a flick off Kyrgiakos). Then, seconds later, Chelsea are at a frazzled Liverpool back line again, the Greek defender sliding in at the very last second to deny Anelka, cocking his leg to shoot eight yards from goal after a free-flowing move down the left involving Cole, Lampard and Drogba.  40 min:  Ballack is booked for a cynical bodycheck and shirt tug on Gerrard as the Liverpool player sweeps past. &quot;I suspect the real reason for the disappearing scores is the Guardian&apos;s desperate attempts to be eco-friendly,&quot; muses Les Brown. &quot;Every time a pigeon flies in with a goal update all the hamsters stop pedaling to watch it.&quot;  42 min:  Ivanovic is allowed to play keepie-uppie headers on the Liverpool penalty spot. What on earth is the home defence up to? This time the referee&apos;s whistle saves them, before Drogba can finally barge in on Ivanovic&apos;s game and hammer a scissor kick goalward.  43 min:  Babel is on for Maxi, who hobbles off the field with a slight limp.  45 min:  Kalou nicks the ball off Mascherano down the left and races clear into the area. He&apos;s about to shoot when Lucas brushes his right thigh, then his left ankle. He stumbles, tries to stay up, and then goes down. The penalty&apos;s not given - which is absolutely amazing, really. Liverpool are particularly fortunate, as Lucas would have been sent off there.  HALF TIME: Liverpool 0-1 Chelsea. Football, eh? Bloody hell. The Chelsea players surround Alan Wiley on the way to the changing rooms, and no wonder. Kalou did go down in an exaggerated fashion, but then he was knocked off his stride by Lucas. That was a surefire penalty. The Brazilian nips off the pitch whistling nervously. Gerrard, meanwhile, simply looks confused, bless him.  STEVEN GERRARD: THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE. &quot;I seem to recall that Gerrard has previous in the suicidal back pass department,&quot; begins Jamie Arrowsmith, &quot;I think having twice put Henry through (once for France at the Euros, the other at Arsenal) for one-on-ones from a similar position as this latest travesty. So when Fergie starts exploding with rage and muttering about conspiracies, he should be reminded of the truth: our captain and talisman can just be a bit of a idiot.&quot;  STEVEN GERRARD: THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION. A lot of emails mentioning lucrative summer transfers to Chelsea, and John Higgins. Do you really expect us to go there? &quot;It was a great defence splitting pass from Gerrard, the best one he&apos;s done all season,&quot; notes Aidan Gibson.  Now then, that&apos;s enough nonsense about poor Stevie. We&apos;re off again, with Liverpool kicking towards the Kop. Cole threads a pass down the inside-left channel for Kalou, who nearly breaks into the box but is eventually bustled off the ball by the impressive Kyrgiakos.  48 min: Liverpool are enjoying a lot of the ball, passing it around their own back line. Chelsea are showing little inclination to press them high upfield.  49 min: Kalou and Malouda combine brilliantly down the left. The cross is cleared to the edge of the area but Drogba strokes it down from the air with a wonderful touch. Benayoun&apos;s upper arm gets involved; free kick to Chelsea, just to the left of goal, outside the area. It&apos;s wasted, two huge hoofs, first from Drogba, then Alex, straight into the wall.  51 min: Chelsea aren&apos;t so shy up front now, Kalou dancing past Mascherano to the byline, where he fizzes a low ball right across the face of goal. Anelka sticks out a leg, two yards out, but can&apos;t time the jab correctly and misses the ball completely. That was so close to the second goal.  54 min: GOAL!!! Liverpool 0-2 Chelsea. This was so simple. From the edge of the area, Drogba pings a ball down the inside-right channel for Anelka, who crosses low into the centre. From two yards out, Lampard slides home, Reina having no chance. An initial question of offside, but Carragher and Mascherano were dawdling and played Anelka on. &quot;At least we can say Steven Gerrard has won a league title now,&quot; notes Callum Hamilton.  56 min: Carragher - who to be fair was limping, rather than dawdling, for the second goal - is replaced by Ayala. &quot;I think I&apos;ve deciphered the squiggly logo on Liverpool&apos;s shirts,&quot; writes Simon Hoyle. &quot;It appears to be Benitez&apos;s instructions to his players. And I think they&apos;ve followed the plan quite well so far.&quot;  59 min: Terry is going to be a real liability for England this summer. His poor form continues, coming across to clear a bouncing ball on the edge of the area, but missing it completely, allowing Babel to attempt an elaborate lob towards goal. It costs Chelsea nothing, but dear me.  62 min: Anfield bristled after Chelsea&apos;s first goal, but the home fans seem more subdued now. No wonder in a way, as the away support are understandably chuntering at length and at some volume, but the second goal has caused Liverpool&apos;s season-long malaise to snap into sharp focus. In the stand, Fernando Torres looks thoroughly miserable, bordering on distraught.  65 min: Chelsea are looking extremely comfortable, barring one moment when Benayoun skinned Cole (but shanked the cross). &quot;Poor old Stevie. He wasn&apos;t trying to get himself a lucrative transfer to Chelsea. I just think that, for once in his career, he wanted to have a say in where the title went.&quot; Ladies and gentlemen, variations on a theme, courtesy of Mac Millings.  66 min: Aquilani has just done something I&apos;ve never seen before. Coming in from the right, ready to volley a dropping ball goalwards, he sliced it at an exact right angle, the ball wheeching across the face of the Chelsea area. That was geometrically perfect.  67 min: Anelka sends a delicious screamer towards the bottom-right corner. Reina is down to tip it away brilliantly. Give or take the odd mistake, he&apos;s the best keeper in the league, isn&apos;t he? Only Heurelho Gomes or Edwin Van der Sar could argue. Or Craig Gordon, obviously.  70 min: Liverpool are showing nothing up front whatsoever. &quot;Maybe Alex Ferguson will vocally lend his support for the 39th international game to be introduced THIS season,&quot; suggests Calin.  72 min: This game has kind of stopped, really. Liverpool were playing well for a while, but now, nothing. They&apos;ve done this a lot this season, a poor, poor show. Anyway, Carlsberg are getting their money&apos;s worth from that shirt. &quot;I&apos;m watching from Taiwan with my Taiwanese girlfriend and asked her to translate the words, thinking they&apos;d be the Carlsberg brand name in Chinese,&quot; writes James Whyte. &quot;She said it roughly translated as &apos;top four no more, stop supporting&apos;, possibly in a nod to all the Asian fans who pick teams solely based on their success.&quot;  74 min: Liverpool attempt a complex training-ground move from a free kick. It involves Aquilani and Kuyt running around at angles, then Gerrard hoofing it straight into the face of the first man. Dear Lord.  76 min: This has a real air of fin de si\u00e8cle for Liverpool, this.  77 min: Aquilani is replaced by Ngog. &quot;How come Gerrard has found the keeper every time with his free-kicks and corners but not with his backpass?&quot; wonders Adam Hirst. &quot;It&apos;s a fix.&quot;  79 min: From 25 yards out, Drogba swings a free kick straight down the throat of Reina, who punches clear. The home fans aren&apos;t making a sound, a depression having settled over Anfield, one that&apos;s not helped by the sheer delight eminating from the away section. &quot;Is Peter Cech really not one of the top four keepers in the Premier League?&quot; wonders Carl Smith. Oh yeah, Cech. I forgot about him, on account of him having nothing to do all day.  81 min: Chelsea manage to cock up a five-on-three. Anelka has a whack at goal, Reina saving at his bottom-right corner, then again as Kalou tries to slot home the rebound. Liverpool, so impressive for much of the first half, are now abject.  84 min: Anelka nearly breaks clear into the Liverpool half from a Liverpool corner. Lucas brilliantly to nick the ball away from him, just as real danger beckoned. &quot;Is Aquilani doing a Tommy Cooper impression in that pic?&quot; wonders Simon Bagwell. &quot;He&apos;s very good.&quot;  87 min: Chelsea are just stroking this around now, to cheers from the away end. Mascherano gets irritated, leaves a foot in, and gets himself booked.  88 min: Kalou is replaced by Zhirkov.  90 min: Liverpool win three corners in a row. A triptych of futility.  90 min +1: In the first of the three minutes to be added on, Kuyt slaps a low shot in from wide left, Cech smothering easily. This is a terrible end to the season at Anfield for Liverpool, likely silver lining to this result for their supporters or no. &quot;I must say that the change in the language of the logo on the Liverpool shirt is a brilliant marketing move,&quot; writes Aniket Chowdhury, &quot;considering that only time anyone will watch their matches in Asia is when the result has any bearing on Man Utd&apos;s title challenge. Having lived in Asia for 20 years, I am yet to come across a fan who supports Liverpool and does not listen to Beatles music.&quot;  90 min +2: &quot;If we get enough corners can we cash them in for a goal?&quot; begs Simon Hoyle.  AND THAT&apos;S IT! CHELSEA CLOSE IN ON THE TITLE. Liverpool 0-2 Chelsea. Manchester United have to avoid defeat at Sunderland in order to keep the title race going, and even then they&apos;ll have to hope Wigan do something at Stamford Bridge next weekend. Chelsea aren&apos;t celebrating like they&apos;ve won the title, but they&apos;re looking as happy as you can get without explicitly doing just that. Liverpool, meanwhile, slink off looking vaguely embarrassed after an ultimately woeful performace, dignity far from salvaged."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/may/05/intel-atom-lincroft", "publicationDate": "2010-05-05T10:18:35Z", "tags": ["Intel", "Mobile phones", "Technology", "Smartphones"], "sentences": ["Intel, in contrast, has traditionally made all its own chips, but it has an SoC deal with TSC (Taiwan Semiconductor Company)."], "title": "New Intel Atom is aimed at tablets and smartphones", "article": "Intel has launched a new version of its Atom processor that uses far less power and &quot;prepares the company to target a range of computing devices, including high-end smartphones, tablets and other mobile handheld products,&quot; said Intel. Belli Kuttanna, chief Intel Atom processor architect, said: &quot;After we delivered the first-generation Intel Atom processor with 10x thermal power reduction, we challenged ourselves to achieve 50x power reduction at the platform level.&quot; The Z6xx system-on-chip (SoC), formerly codenamed Lincroft, includes 3-D graphics, video encoding/decoding and memory and display controllers. Intel says it can support &quot;HD 1080p high-profile video decoding and 720p HD video recording&quot;, bringing &quot;a rich, PC-like visual experience to powerful handheld computers&quot;. The mobile phone and smartphone markets are dominated by ARM designs, and it is expanding into tablets (such as the Apple iPad) and netbooks. ARM doesn&apos;t make chips: it designs processor cores that can be used to create system-on-a-chip designs such as Tegra and Snapdragon. This allows for lots of innovation and customisation. Intel, in contrast, has traditionally made all its own chips, but it has an SoC deal with TSC (Taiwan Semiconductor Company). I asked Jose Maiz, Intel&apos;s director of Logic Technology Quality and Reliability, about the scope for non-Intel sourcing and he told me: &quot;We will give them as much flexibility as they like.&quot; It still seems unlikely that the new Z6xx Atom chip will have much impact on the ARM chip&apos;s dominance. However, Intel has made extraordinary progress in moving its x86 architecture from large power-hungry Pentium-type chips to very small low-power Atoms. It has narrowed the gap to ARM, and it&apos;s not stopping. Christian Morales, director of Intel Europe, says: &quot;My view is that next year we will really see a breakthrough in the [smartphone] market.&quot; Today&apos;s Atom chips are more suitable for netbooks and media tablets than smartphones.

Quick-growing tropical cobia could replace dwindling species", "article": "A new fast-growing tropical fish that could provide an alternative to popular species for environmentally-conscious fish-lovers is being imported to the UK. With recent studies revealing that UK&apos;s fish stocks have fallen by 94% in the past 100 years, Marine Farms argues that cobia, which has white flesh and a high oil content, could be the next big farmed fish species. The fish grows three times faster than Atlantic salmon and has good taste and consistency according to Bj\u00f8rn Myrseth, the chief executive of Marine Farms, based in Norway. &quot;For us it is a very attractive fish because of the rate of growth. It can grow from about 1g to 5kg -6kg in a year, when it takes salmon around 30 to 36 months to reach the same size. It also has good eating qualities with very firm flesh and high oil content. It is easy to prepare and has a nice mild flavour,&quot; he said. In the wild, cobia can grow up to 60kg, but it is very uncommon for the fish to be caught commercially, he said. Marine Farms expects to produce 1,500 tonnes of the fish this year for export. There are plans to expand the site, which has the capacity to produce up to 6,000 tonnes a year, depending on demand. &quot;The challenge will be to introduce the fish and convince people to eat it \u2013 we have to make it known to people,&quot; he said. The fish could also provide a viable alternative for other fish species that are under strain. Said Myrseth: &quot;With a high oil content, it is also great raw for sushi or sashimi. It can also be used as a replacement for fish such as tuna, if people are looking for an environmentally sustainable alternative, as the texture and flavour are quite similar.&quot; The fish is currently placed at the more expensive end of the market and costs slightly more than Atlantic salmon, said Myrseth. &quot;But we hope that as demand grows the cost of the fish will go down, and if demand is high enough it could become a relatively inexpensive fish in the future,&quot; he said. Cobia has been commercially produced in Asia, particularly in Taiwan where it is stocked in about 80% of ocean cages, according to the Marine Farms website. It has operated a cobia farm in Florida since 2002 and has opened operations in Belize and Vietnam. The Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch, which publishes guides for sustainable seafood purchasing, recommends US-farmed cobia as it is farmed inland with closed recirculating systems that help prevent diseases and pollutants. However, it advises against buying cobia from outside the US as it is often farmed in floating or submerged cages and pens in nearshore and open ocean waters. &quot;This creates a risk of disease transfer, escapes and pollution impacts on surrounding ecosystems and species,&quot; according to the Seafood Watch website. Myrseth said all Marine Farm cobia was sustainably farmed in low-density ocean cages with site rotation to prevent disease and damage to the environment. &quot;This is very important to us, because if the environment is impacted we are the first to feel that,&quot; he said. The company&apos;s cobia is fed on fish oil, fishmeal and vegetable protein but it aims to feed the fish on vegetable protein in the future, he added. Dawn Purchase, aquaculture officer at the Marine Conservation Society, said: &quot;With 50% of global seafood now being farmed it is essential that all current and new farmed species coming into the UK market is produced in the most environmentally sustainable way possible, which ensures the health and diversity of the environment on which it depends.&quot; Charles Clover, creator of The End of the Line \u2013 an expos\u00e9 of the fishing industry \u2013 declined to comment on cobia specifically but said the farming of carnivorous fish posed significant environmental problems because of the shortage of smaller fish to provide food. &quot;Without that it is difficult to see how the aquaculture industry is going to continue to grow, unless they find some way of creating synthetic fish food,&quot; he said. &quot;And as fish have been eating other fish for millions of years, that is not going to be easy.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/may/07/1", "publicationDate": "2010-05-07T05:55:00Z", "tags": ["Technology"], "sentences": ["The Web is fundamentally a distracted experience.&quot; China players aggressively entering tablet PC market - Digitimes&quot;China-based PC players including first-tier notebook brand Lenovo, e-book reader brand Hanwang and white-box brand Malata, have all expressed their interest in entering the tablet PC market, according to sources from notebook makers,&quot; says Taiwan&apos;s Digitimes."], "title": "The Technology newsbucket: Google videos and translating Goggles, Twitter apps, Facebook, HTML5 and more", "article": "     Google Chrome Speed Tests - YouTubeAll sorts of crazy stuff as the Chrome browser is compared with fast things in real life, from a potato to lightning.

But halfway round the globe from the company&apos;s California headquarters, a young worker who has spent months in an eastern Chinese hospital wants consumers to look beyond the shiny exterior of such gadgets. &quot;People should know what we do to create these products and what cost we pay,&quot; said Bai Bing as she perched on a bed in her ward. She is one of scores of young workers in the city of Suzhou who were poisoned by the chemical n-hexane, which they say was used to clean Apple components including iPhone touch screens. Wu Mei \u2013 who, like the others, asked the Guardian to use her nickname \u2013 recalled her fear as her health suddenly deteriorated last spring. At first, she thought she was simply tired from the long working hours at Wintek, a Taiwan-owned electronics giant supplying several well-known brands. She was weaker than before and noticed she could not walk so fast. &quot;Then it became more and more serious. I found it very hard to go upstairs and if I squatted down I didn&apos;t have the strength to get up. Later my hands became numb and I lost my balance \u2013 I would fall over if someone touched me,&quot; she said. By summer, she was admitted to hospital, where doctors struggled to diagnose the cause. &quot;I was terrified. I feared I might be paralysed and spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair,&quot; she said. Because she was using n-hexane directly, she was one of the first and worst affected. But more and more workers from the same room were suffering headaches, dizziness and weakness, and pains in their limbs. An occupational diseases hospital which saw several victims diagnosed the problem in August and Wintek stopped using the chemical. But thanks to the previous months of exposure, at least 62 workers would require medical care. Many spent months in hospital. Some believe more employees left Wintek after being taken ill, before they realised what was wrong. Prolonged over-exposure to n-hexane can cause extensive damage to the peripheral nervous system and ultimately the spinal cord, leading to muscular weakness and atrophy and even paralysis, said Paul Whitehead, a toxicology consultant and member of the UK&apos;s Royal Society of Chemistry. It can also affect male fertility. Recovery can take a year or more. The chemical&apos;s potential risks are well-known in industry, as are safe exposure limits. But the Wintek manager who decided to switch from alcohol to n-hexane for cleaning \u2013 apparently because it dried more quickly \u2013 did not assess the dangers. It was used without proper ventilation. The change was obvious; workers disliked the pungent smell of n-hexane. But they had no idea it might affect their health. &quot;We hadn&apos;t even heard of occupational illnesses before,&quot; said Wintek worker Xiao Ling. &quot;I&apos;m very, very angry,&quot; added Wu. &quot;I thought they behaved too badly.&quot; Asked if they knew what products they were working on, three of the affected Wintek employees said team leaders told them they were working for Apple. They instantly recognised pictures of an iPhone and said they were cleaning touch screens, adding that items for other brands were not affected because Apple had isolated its production line. A lawyer acting for 44 of the poisoning victims also said several had named Apple. Wintek, which does not discuss its clients, said it had replaced the factory&apos;s general manager. It now notifies workers whose jobs may involve risk in advance, has tightened procedures for the introduction of new chemicals, and carries out medical checks. It has paid medical fees for those affected and says it will pay compensation according to the law. Given that the assessment and appeals process for compensation can take as long as a decade, lawyers hope the firm will pay quickly as well as fairly. Other patients at the hospital say they too became sick while using n-hexane on Apple products. Bai Bing said she and her colleagues were cleaning components including Apple logos \u2013 the kind that appear at the bottom of desktop screens \u2013 when she fell ill. Her employer, Yunheng, could not be reached, but work safety officials in Suzhou have said eight employees were poisoned there as they carried out work sub-contracted by another firm, Surtec. A Surtec employee confirmed that it made Apple logos, but a spokesman said it knew nothing about Yunheng or the poisoning. Wintek has previously faced questions about its treatment of workers, with disputes in Taiwan and at another plant on the mainland. The Suzhou case only grabbed public attention when lingering concern over the poisoning and anger over unpaid bonuses sparked a mass protest. Wintek blamed a misunderstanding and said bonuses had been paid and the dispute \u2013 like the other conflicts \u2013 resolved. It added that it had worked to improve communications with workers. There is no suggestion that Apple was responsible for the use of n-hexane. Apple declined to answer questions about the poisonings or about the firms involved, saying it does not reveal who it works with, although its spokeswoman added that Wintek had been &quot;quite proactive&quot; in discussing the issue. Instead it pointed to its code of conduct, which sets strict requirements for working and environmental practices, adding that many suppliers say they are the only customer carrying out such checks. But the 2010 audit shows that manufacturers are routinely breaching the code. The majority \u2013 54% \u2013 broke the 60-hour weekly work limit more than half the time. Another 39% failed to meet occupational injury prevention requirements; 17% failed on chemical exposure standards; and 35% did not meet wage and benefits requirements, with 24 of the 102 factories audited paying less than minimum wage for regular hours. Three facilities used underage workers and three had falsified records. Apple said it terminated the contract in one of the latter cases, and required suppliers to make improvements and submit to reviews following other breaches. It has also trained more workers about their rights. The firm argues that publishing the audits provides a level of transparency. But until it identifies its manufacturers, outsiders have no way of assessing how well its policies are working and what action it is taking to deal with problems such as the n-hexane poisoning. &quot;Apple is the most paranoid about commercial and product secrecy. That&apos;s getting in the way of ensuring workers&apos; rights are protected,&quot; says Geoff Crothall of China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based organisation campaigning for workers&apos; rights. The US giant \u2013 which last month reported quarterly profits of more than $3bn \u2013 could afford to monitor factories with serious issues &quot;day in, day out&quot; if it wished, he added. &quot;Apple products are not cheap and most Apple customers are willing to pay a premium \u2013 so why not add a tiny little bit extra to ensure working and environmental standards are met, as well as product quality?&quot; he asked. In the meantime, while Wintek says most of the poisoned employees have returned to work, at least some are opting to protect themselves by leaving factory life. &quot;I want to be as far as possible away from chemicals and the electronics plants,&quot; said Bai Bing. &quot;I want some job, safe.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/may/08/laura-munson-interview", "publicationDate": "2010-05-07T23:10:10Z", "tags": ["Marriage", "Relationships", "Life and style", "Books", "Culture", "Women"], "sentences": ["The offers are pouring in \u2013 China and Taiwan have bought the rights, the German contract is being negotiated."], "title": "Laura Munson: How I kept my husband", "article": "One fine June day, in the mountains of Montana, Laura Munson&apos;s husband said to her, &quot;I don&apos;t love you any more. I&apos;m not sure I ever did. I&apos;m moving out. The kids will understand. They&apos;ll want me to be\u00a0happy.&quot; What is the normal reaction to this kind of announcement? You can sob and wail and get down on your knees and beg. Alternatively, you can pick up the meat cleaver and, when the car skids off down the driveway, cut the crotch out of\u00a0all his suits. But Munson did none of these things. She wasn&apos;t going to let him get away with\u00a0this. She said, &quot;I don&apos;t buy it.&quot;     Guardian Imaging Department    He apparently looked most surprised. Then he\u00a0probably narrowed his eyes \u2013 for the next thing he said was, &quot;I don&apos;t like what you&apos;ve\u00a0become.&quot; At this point, Munson says, &quot;a shroud of calm enveloped me&quot;. She thought, &quot;It&apos;s just words.&quot; Sticks and stones. Again she said, &quot;I don&apos;t buy it.&quot; Then she added, &quot;It&apos;s not age-appropriate to expect children to be concerned with their parents&apos; happiness\u2026 There are times in every relationship when the parties involved need a\u00a0break. What can we do to give you the distance you need, without hurting the family?&quot; He said, &quot;Huh?&quot; She said, &quot;Go trekking in Nepal. Build a yurt in the back meadow. Turn the garage studio into a man-cave. Get that drum set you&apos;ve always wanted. Anything but hurting the children and me with a reckless move like the one you&apos;re talking about.&quot; Then she said again, &quot;How can we have a\u00a0responsible distance?&quot; He said, &quot;I don&apos;t want distance. I want to move\u00a0out.&quot;     Guardian Imaging Department    She Googled &quot;responsible separation&quot; on the computer, and printed off a list of FAQs about the sharing of keys, credit card access, pets, etcetera. Appalled, he snarled, &quot;I see what you&apos;re doing. You&apos;re going to make me go into therapy!&quot; She said, &quot;I just asked: what can we do to give you the distance you need?&quot; Do you want to know what happened next? Are you gripped? America certainly is. Munson&apos;s book, This Is Not The Story You Think It Is\u2026 A Season Of Unlikely Happiness, is now a publishing phenomenon in the US. She has been interviewed by ABC News on Good Morning America and you can see her on YouTube: a picture of all-American wholesomeness \u2013 pretty, round face, perfectly aligned teeth, long, glossy brown hair. She claims to be handy with a chainsaw and is used to hauling 1,500lb horses into trailers. You don&apos;t doubt it. When we talk, it&apos;s 9am in Montana and Munson is sitting with a cup of tea and a view of pines and firs and mountains in the distance. She has got the kids off to school and needs the rest: she is just back from a three-week book tour. The offers are pouring in \u2013 China and Taiwan have bought the rights, the German contract is being negotiated. Things haven&apos;t always been so professionally rosy. Before this book, Munson wrote 14 novels that have never been published. Lesser mortals would have given up, but Munson just developed armadillo hide for skin. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she says. &quot;As a writer, you spill out your guts and care so much about it and you send it off and you get back [the letter saying], &apos;This does not meet our needs at this time.&apos; So when your husband says, &apos;You do not meet my needs at\u00a0this time&apos;, you say, &apos;OK, those are just words. I\u00a0know how to deal with that.&apos;&quot; We return to that fateful morning. It seems pretty simple. She said, &quot;No, you can&apos;t go, but I\u00a0can give you a long lead&quot; and eventually he said, &quot;Oh, all right then.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s not like I handcuffed him to a chair,&quot; Munson says. &quot;I just didn&apos;t take it personally. People in crisis say all sorts of things.&quot; Surely it must have been incredibly annoying, having someone staying completely calm and saying, &quot;Do you need a bit of distance?&quot; Munson replies, &quot;Well, then he can&apos;t play victim. He has to be responsible for his own wellbeing. When you don&apos;t engage in the drama, it bounces back to the person who flung it in the first place.&quot; In her writing, Munson uses the analogy of a child having a tantrum. The child shouts that they hate you. Do you join in? Do you answer back? Of course you don&apos;t. It&apos;s their problem, not yours. You ignore the tantrum and walk away, even if the toddler&apos;s teeth are still clamped around your arm. She says carefully, &quot;I&apos;m not saying my husband was being a child.&quot; His spiritual malaise was profound \u2013 a personal crisis triggered by the failure of his business \u2013 and he wasn&apos;t merely throwing a tantrum. Of course, nobody would dream of saying thwarted middle-aged men behave like toddlers \u2013 perish the thought \u2013 but when a toddler is out of sorts, you give them &quot;time out&quot;. And that is precisely what Munson offered her husband. So that summer, instead of moving out \u2013 the credit card list seemed to have frightened him \u2013 Munson&apos;s husband did what he was told and took &quot;time out&quot;. Effectively he went awol. He came home late, if at all. He wouldn&apos;t call. When he was at home, he was distant, making zero eye contact except for occasional, discombobulating moments when he desired intimacy. He forgot her birthday and went to someone else&apos;s 4th of July party. And he went walkabout. Like an old bear, he retreated into the forest. &quot;He spent a lot of time at a friend&apos;s fishing lodge. He&apos;d take three or four days away.&quot; And what did she do? &quot;We live in such a beautiful part of the world and it was summertime, so the kids were out of school [Munson&apos;s daughter was then 12 and her son eight] and there was a lot of being with them in nature. There was more writing, more getting on my horse. I\u00a0did grounded stuff: cooking, gardening. I\u00a0was incredibly calm. That was a summer of unlikely happiness. I don&apos;t mean &apos;blissed-out&apos; happiness, but sometimes happiness is just one little step outside of suffering. For me, that summer was a very calm, grounded time full of deep breathing.&quot; But here there is a little pause, and she adds: &quot;And inner tantrums. Believe me. When I was out alone in the woods, I was screaming at trees and crying and galloping my horse as fast as I could and diving into freezing mountain lakes. &quot;Of course you think, &apos;Is there another woman?&apos;, &apos;What sort of role model am I being?&apos;, &apos;How much longer can I put up with this?&apos; This is\u00a0a man I love and is a great father\u2026 and suddenly he is being a\u00a0completely different person. We all have these destructive thoughts in\u00a0our head. In the book I\u00a0name them &apos;my evil twin sister Sheila&apos;. I\u00a0have no idea where I came up with that \u2013 probably a soap opera from the 80s.&quot; Yet in front of her husband and children, Munson remained composed. Indeed, it is her unusual composure in the face of marital crisis that seems to have caught the public imagination, provoking a flurry of debate. Some see her as a Gandhi-like figure, others as a\u00a0doormat, still others as &quot;passive aggressive&quot;. Time ran a story on How To Save Your Marriage By Not Doing Anything, while the Newsweek headline read When Divorce Isn&apos;t The Only Choice. Munson is being held up as a role model for a radical new relationship dynamic, but can anyone else learn from her experience? Marriage gurus point out that there are different kinds of relationship breakdown \u2013 long, corrosive ones \u2013 that might be\u00a0beyond repair, and sudden crises that could benefit from a Munson-style stonewalling. For all her slightly new age references and talk of deep breathing and eternal wisdom, Munson is, in fact, advocating rather old-fashioned values: stoicism, loyalty, self-control, reticence, discretion. To her credit, her children remained more or less unaware of what was happening that summer (though they can&apos;t be now). She was also careful in whom she confided: &quot;I didn&apos;t share it with many people. I chose friends who loved my husband and believed in us, not friends who&apos;d say, &apos;Kick him out!&apos; People love a drama, and a drama doesn&apos;t necessarily serve anyone or anything.&quot; What Munson believes helped her cope and see what was happening to her husband was the fact that, two years earlier, she had undergone her own personal crisis. In a short space of time, her first big publishing deal had folded, her father died suddenly and her dog was shot. &quot;I was miserable. Suffering had become my norm. And that&apos;s when I hired a\u00a0good therapist.&quot; The therapist helped her revaluate her priorities, learn to embrace the present and not judge herself by worldly success. Armed with this wider perspective \u2013 and the 14\u00a0novel-thick armadillo skin \u2013 she was prepared for anything. In\u00a0fact, she says, the marital crisis was grist to the\u00a0mill: &quot;I\u00a0like to say I had the map and he gave me the territory.&quot; It was, for all the suffering, an oddly exhilarating experience. Munson had set herself a six-month limit for her husband&apos;s &quot;time out&quot;. But a family tragedy made him start to sort himself out a little sooner. &quot;His sister got cancer and her husband had just left her and she had five children and she actually died last 4 July. Midway through that summer, he\u00a0went to live with her and help her, and I think it was that experience of seeing somebody he loved so dearly lose their life at such a young age. He began to understand what was really important wasn&apos;t his job. It was his relationships.&quot; The day he came home from that visit to his sister, &quot;I was in the hot tub, and he came out and got in and he said, &apos;I just have to apologise for everything I have put you through this summer, and I can never repay you. I am a 40-year-old trying to be a 20-year-old, and I realise my career is done with and I have to find something else.&quot; Other encouraging signs followed: he started fixing broken doorknobs, and murmuring about repainting the porch, and getting logs in for the winter. Then came the clincher: &quot;One day I came home and there was a satellite truck in our driveway. I thought, &apos;Huh! This guy is getting the satellite upgraded. He might mow the lawn and not come back. But a guy that has ordered more sports channels \u2013 he is not going anywhere!&quot; And he stayed. By Thanksgiving 2008, the crisis was over. Now they are back together and he has found a job. &quot;Of course,&quot; she adds, a little tartly, &quot;at the end it is not all tied up in a perfect pink bow.&quot; And the moral of it all? Her book is not, she insists, a guide on How To Keep Your Man. On the contrary: &quot;It&apos;s all about letting go. Suddenly, the minute I let go of ever getting published, and of my marital outcome, that is when everything turns round.

It has been a whirlwind spring for the singer, who shot to international fame with his performance on the Taiwanese karaoke show Avenue to Stardom. The video went viral, and almost 10 million people have watched Yu Chun warble through the Bodyguard soundtrack hit I Will Always Love You. The shy and portly singer, with an unfashionable bowl haircut, was instantly compared to dowdy Scottish star Susan Boyle. Boyle, now 49, stunned viewers of Britain&apos;s Got Talent \u2013 and went on to release the best-selling album of 2009. Like Boyle, Yu Chun did not win his televised talent contest, but he soon became a minor US sensation, performing on The Ellen Degeneres Show, and on George Lopez, where he sang Total Eclipse of the Heart with, er, William Shatner. &quot;I now have more confidence in pursuing a singing career,&quot; Yu Chun told the Associated Press. &quot;You don&apos;t have to be a good-looking man or woman to succeed. Just be yourself and try your best.&quot; Nicknamed &quot;Little Fatty&quot;, Yu Chun said he has been mocked throughout his life for his round figure and high-pitched voice. Now, those same attributes have attracted Sony Music, which promises to release a collection of Chinese and English songs performed by Yu Chun. They haven&apos;t said whether I Will Always Love You, written by Dolly Parton but made even more famous by Whitney Houston, will appear on the album. Yu Chun learned the song during his loneliest days, sequestered in his room. &quot;I played it again and again even though my parents couldn&apos;t stand it any more and asked me to stop,&quot; he said. Certainly, his version sounds better than Houston&apos;s most recent attempts. Yu Chun, who is Taiwanese, should not be mistaken for &quot;the Chinese Susan Boyle&quot;, 79-year-old Wu Baiwei. Unfortunately, the former university lecturer is still waiting for her record deal. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 May 2010.

But such investment doesn&apos;t automatically guarantee a hi-tech approach: the solar panels will be tilted towards the sun each day by hand and a roaming gaggle of geese will be used to keep the surrounding grass at a manageable length. A consortium of local companies calling itself &quot;Silicon Vineyards&quot; says the proposed 2MW facility at Benbole Farm \u2013 which would be the first utility-scale solar farm in the UK - would generate enough electricity to power 600 homes. It will also grow biomass crops and house an anaerobic digester as an alternative source of power generation. The consortium, which includes the commercial arm of the University of Exeter and a Penzance-based renewables specialist called Renewable Energy Cooperative (R-ECO), says construction could begin in October if planning is approved. The solar farm could start generating electricity commercially by April 2011. The new coalition government has pledged to &quot;seek to increase the target for renewable energy subject to the advice of the Climate Change Committee&quot;. In 2008, 2.25% of energy was produced from renewable sources in the UK, according the Department of Energy and Climate Change. The previous government had set a target of producing 15% of energy from renewables by 2020. The Benbole Farm business plan estimates that by utilising the recently introduced feed-in tariff which pays generators on this scale 29.3p/kWh, the farm could have an annual turnover of \u00a3700,000 within seven years. By year 25, the business plan says the farm will have generated a total revenue of \u00a313m. The consortium says it is now speaking to the National Union of Farmers in the hope it will urge its members to consider this technology as a lucrative source of income. Solar farms are increasingly popular in dry and sunny regions in the US and southern Spain, but the consortium is confident that rain-blessed Cornwall is the logical next frontier for solar technology. &quot;The panels will still be generating, albeit reduced, when there is cloud cover,&quot; said Abraham Cambridge, R-ECO&apos;s technical and commercial manager. &quot;The optimum months will be May, June, September and October, which are Cornwall&apos;s best months for sun.&quot; To reduce costs, R-ECO says it is cheaper to employ five staff to manually adjust the panels so they face towards the sun as it moves across the sky than install automated tilting mechanisms. If all 10 farms get the go-ahead, the scheme is expected to create 300 jobs. All the components, such as the steel cradles, would be made in Cornwall. Only the silicon PV cells themselves would be sourced from outside the county, in this case Taiwan. Cornwall has been at the vanguard of the renewable energy industry in the UK since the country&apos;s first wind farm was built in the early 1990s. This summer, a \u00a342m electrical &quot;socket&quot; will be laid on the seabed 10 miles off St Ives in anticipation of the installation of four wave energy machines. Earlier this month, Cornwall council signalled its intention to build its own \u00a315m &quot;solar park&quot; on council-owned land next to Newquay airport. The Silicon Vineyards consortium is confident its proposed solar farms will face far less public resistance than compared to wind turbine applications. &quot;The visual interference will be negligible. It&apos;s very low to the ground and the surface of the panels are matt rather than reflective. No planning concerns have been raised by the local planning authority after initial inspections,&quot; said Cambridge. But the solar farm at Benbole Farm could still face some local resistance. Richard Gooden, vice-chair of St Kew Parish Council, said parishioners were only informed of the proposal last week. &quot;I can see there being some objections as the proposed site is adjacent to an area of outstanding beauty. You&apos;ve got to be careful you don&apos;t destroy the one thing that brings people to Cornwall \u2013 its natural beauty.&quot; The Campaign to Protect Rural England, which has opposed the construction of many wind farms, says it &quot;awaits to see the plans with interest&quot;, but adds it would prefer that &quot;car parks and factory roofs&quot; were considered first when siting these sorts of projects."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/may/19/self-assembly-restaurant-food", "publicationDate": "2010-05-19T12:00:00Z", "tags": ["Restaurants", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "sentences": ["I&apos;ve even been forced to experience an awful thing called a &apos;Mongolian Barbecue&apos; apparently invented in Taiwan but popular in South Africa, which involves not only selecting your own ingredients but stir-frying them yourself in a sort of wok arrangement."], "title": "Self-assembly restaurant food", "article": "Life&apos;s all about decisions. Which bunch of dead-eyed weasels do you trust to run the country? Should I start watching Glee or put the telly on Freebay? Should I be using a comma or a semi-colon? It&apos;s a relief, therefore, at the end of the day to be able to make a pleasurable one. What am I having for tea? Sometimes, even better, we can decide not to decide by going out to eat and have all the work and most of the choosing done for us. Except that restaurateurs seem increasingly unwilling to take responsibility for their side of the bargain. Some of them seem to want us to do far too much of the work.I&apos;d like to make a confession. I went skiing earlier this year. I don&apos;t want you to form the impression that this is something I enjoy - in fact given the combination of heights, cold, wet, sport and French people, I find it hard to imagine something I&apos;d loathe more. That said, the alternative was to sit alone in dreich Camden and I could at least, wiser counsels advised, enjoy the food.  Food in ski resorts is special. It must, by some local law, involve equipment and ritual and you have to get involved. Fondue is the obvious starting point with forks and spirit lamps, not dropping your breadcube and myths about huge balls of cheese forming in your gut. Raclette involves a cheese strapped into an appliance that looks like a Victorian sun-lamp or something you might find in a suburban S&amp;M dungeon. There&apos;s a thing called Pierre Chaud which, although it sounds like the name of a superannuated French Pop star is actually a hot rock on which you&apos;re supposed to enjoy cooking your own steak, and this time I discovered an entirely new species, a kind of wrought-iron top hat filled with hot coals. No idea what the damn thing was called but it was mounded with potatoes, cheese and salty pork products, so hey, as they say, what&apos;s not to like? Although the French are masters of comedy DIY stunt cuisine, they are by no means alone. Mexican food, though it has a dignified history and draws from an awesome range of ingredients and techniques, usually manifests itself in the UK as some form of self-assembly operation - pots of doings and hot bits on cast iron sizzling plates arrive for the diners to pile up and wrap in a tortilla. Chinese restaurants offer the crispy duck pancake, a similar concept - though my local Chinese has obviously been learning from IKEA as there&apos;s invariably a vital part missing when it arrives at the table and trying to get them to rectify the situation is rarely worth the effort. I&apos;ve even been forced to experience an awful thing called a &apos;Mongolian Barbecue&apos; apparently invented in Taiwan but popular in South Africa, which involves not only selecting your own ingredients but stir-frying them yourself in a sort of wok arrangement. Some of the better restaurants let you hand your ingredients to a professional for the actual cooking bit. Heston Blumenthal would argue that there&apos;s a place for theatre at the dinner table and certainly, now there&apos;s no-one left who&apos;ll do crepes suzette on a gu\u00e9ridon, the tableside performances of his specialist liquid nitrogen cooks are an excellent substitute. Teppanyaki restaurants have been a great family tradition in the States since the 70s and we can now experience the spatula juggling and blistering knife skills ourselves as they&apos;ve spread to the UK. At sushi restaurants I can&apos;t afford, people seem to like watching the chef do his work. At the ones I can afford, there&apos;s something meditative about watching the stuff go round on a conveyor and waiting for your favourites to come round again. On balance though, I prefer choosing my dinner from a limited list and then having it made for me. If I found doing it myself so all-fired thrilling, I&apos;d have stayed at home and cooked - but I can see how large groups of people who don&apos;t cook much might find the entertainment of assembling their dinner engaging. Most of us don&apos;t object to a little spectacle with dinner but it&apos;s a delicate line to tread between &apos;delighting the eye as well as the palate&apos; and what is invariably described on the website as a &apos;dining experience&apos; - a little piece of marketing speak that can drain all the joy from a meal in microseconds. Where do you draw the line? How heavily do you want to be involved in the selection and preparation of your restaurant meal? Are you happy to do all the work while the waiters watch and at what point does the presentation of the meal become an obtrusive performance that detracts from the food?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/may/20/nvidia-android-tablet-ipad-rival", "publicationDate": "2010-05-20T10:53:24Z", "tags": ["Android", "Google", "Tablet computers", "Apple", "iPad", "Computing", "Technology"], "sentences": ["Real products should appear at the Computex trade show in Taiwan (June 1-5), with up to 50 companies targeting the market.", "Most of these tablets will probably disappear leaving little trace, but Taiwanese companies such as MSI and Asus have the distribution networks and advertising money to reach a wide audience."], "title": "Nvidia shows new iPad-topping Tegra 2 tablet prototype", "article": "     Nvidia has been showing off a new Android touch-screen tablet powered by its Tegra 2 processor, albeit only running an American football game (BackBreaker by Natural Motion), rather than showing the full user interface.

(I prefer 4:3 myself but the market has gone widescreen.) Unlike the iPad, Google Android tablets will be able to access most web sites and play games such as FarmVille, because they can run Adobe Flash. At Netbook News, Nicole Scott says: &quot;The unit measured around 1cm in thickness, but talking to Andrew Edelsten from Nvidia he did remind me that it is a prototype and there are much thinner and lighter versions behind closed doors.&quot; Nvidia&apos;s tablet has reportedly been made by Foxconn (Hon Hai), which also makes the Apple iPad. However, bear in mind this is not a product launch. Real products should appear at the Computex trade show in Taiwan (June 1-5), with up to 50 companies targeting the market.

US and German government bonds also rallied as traders sought safety from the eurozone crisis. There were losses across Europe&apos;s major stock markets, with Germany&apos;s Dax down 1.8% and France&apos;s CAC 40 losing 1.2%. Indices in Spain, Portugal and Italy also fell into the red, following a sell-off in Asia overnight. Will Hedden, sales trader at IG Index, said investors were braced for further losses later today. &quot;With markets still a little punch-drunk following the German decision earlier this week to restrict short-selling, investors may be wary of any other government announcements over the coming weekend and may choose to sit on cash until the situation becomes clearer.&quot; Financial stocks were among the biggest fallers in London, with Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered both losing more than 4%. Analysts said that the banking sector was suffering from the US Senate&apos;s approval last night of sweeping changes to the way Wall Street is regulated. The sell-off came despite news this morning that Germany&apos;s parliament had approved a bill that allows Germany to contribute to the \u20ac750bn (\u00a3650bn) rescue package for the eurozone drawn up with the International Monetary Fund a fortnight ago. Bank of Japan governor Masaaki Shirakawa added to the tension by warning that financial markets &quot;remain unstable&quot; due to the Greek debt crisis. Asian markets tumbled after stocks on Wall Street took their deepest dive in more than a year yesterday. Japan&apos;s Nikkei 225 stock average lost 245.77 points, or 2.45%, to 9,784.54, while Taiwan was down 2.5%. Indonesia&apos;s benchmark stock index plunged 4%, Singapore dropped nearly 2% and India slid 1.3%. Only shares in Shanghai recovered in late trading, rising 0.24%. David Cameron met German chancellor Angela Merkel today while Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, will present his proposals to overhaul the eurozone at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels, the second this week. Berlin has tabled a nine-point plan rewriting the euro regime to include legally enshrined budget deficit ceilings in all 16 member countries. The German demands, in a finance ministry paper obtained by the Guardian, could require the EU&apos;s Lisbon treaty to be renegotiated. In what appeared to be a concession to her centre-left opposition, Merkel vowed yesterday to fight for a global tax on bank transactions at the G20 summit next month. Berlin has also proposed a radical shift in the rules governing the single currency by insisting struggling eurozone countries be allowed to restructure their debt. Sch\u00e4uble argues that that if the G20 effort fails Europe, or at least the eurozone, should go it alone. The wave of selling came amid growing fears that the Greek debt crisis could spread to other countries in Europe and trigger a spiral of losses for banks, endangering the still fragile global economic recovery. An unexpected increase in US unemployment yesterday added to the gloom. The crisis in the eurozone and Germany&apos;s shock decision to impose a unilateral ban on naked short-selling \u2013 a strategy designed to profit from falling markets \u2013 drove shares in London down to 5,000 yesterday for the first time since November. Sch\u00e4uble defended Germany&apos;s actions yesterday, saying: &quot;If you want to drain a swamp, you don&apos;t ask the frogs for an objective assessment of the situation.&quot; Gary Jenkins at Evolution Securities said: &quot;True. But if the frogs are an integral part of your financial and economic system you may want to consider the implications of your actions before you act. And if the pond is partly owned by your neighbours you might want to have a chat with them before you start your unilateral action.

Washington and Tokyo have yet to reach agreement on the planned relocation of Futenma, a sprawling airbase located in a heavily populated city on Okinawa, an island 1,000 miles south of the capital which hosts more than half the 47,000 US troops based in Japan. &quot;We both seek an arrangement that is operationally viable and politically sustainable,&quot; Clinton told reporters in Tokyo at the start of a three-nation tour of Asia. &quot;The goal of our governments remains unchanged: we want to maintain the security of Japan and the stability of the region.&quot; Yukio Hatoyama, Japan&apos;s prime minister, who has given himself until the end of the month to devise a solution, angered the Obama White House by suggesting he would ditch an earlier agreement to build a replacement for the base off the island&apos;s remote north coast. The same deal would see 8,000 US marines and their families move to the US Pacific territory of Guam by 2014. Hatoyama had hoped to move the base off the island altogether, but has been unable to reach agreement with potential host communities in other parts of Japan. Clinton said the two countries would continue to seek agreement by the 31 May deadline. &quot;We have committed to redoubling our efforts to meet the deadline that has been announced by the Japanese government,&quot; she said after meeting Japan&apos;s foreign minister, Katsuya Okada. Bilateral talks over the future of Futenma, home to 2,000 marines, were sparked by public outrage following the abduction and rape of a 12-year-old girl by three US servicemen in 1995. While many Okinawans oppose the military presence, Washington insists that the island is ideally located should the US need to intervene in conflicts on the Korean peninsula or between China and Taiwan. Japan has been diplomatically wrongfooted by the sinking in March of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy ship, in which 46 sailors died, and evidence that a North Korean torpedo was to blame. Mounting tensions on the Korean peninsula have lent weight to the US-Japan security alliance and made it more likely that Hatoyama will bow to the White House&apos;s wishes over Futenma. Okada appeared to concede as much: &quot;I want to explain frankly to the Japanese people that the presence of US troops in Japan is indispensable to Japan&apos;s security and to the peace and stability of the region in the current security environment.&quot; Referring to the Cheonan sinking, he added: &quot;We need to be aware this could happen to us. There is no guarantee it won&apos;t happen to Japan.&quot; Hatoyama, meanwhile, has seen support for his administration plummet amid mounting criticism of his handling of the Futenma relocation. Having vowed during last summer&apos;s general election to move the base off Okinawa, he recently angered local people when he conceded it would be impossible to fulfil his promise. Media reports this week suggested that Hatoyama was preparing to accept a tweaked version of the 2006 plan, which would require building a new offshore runway, a move opposed by locals and environmentalists. Some analysts believe his Democratic party could lose the support of a leftwing coalition partner over the issue and risk losing control of the upper house before elections for the chamber in July. Even if he survives until then, a very poor performance at the polls could force Hatoyama&apos;s resignation, less than a year after his party swept into power after a landslide defeat of the once-dominant Liberal Democratic party."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/may/22/taiwan-taipei-direct-flights", "publicationDate": "2010-05-21T23:06:21Z", "tags": ["Taiwan holidays", "Hotels", "Cultural trips", "Luxury travel", "Restaurants", "China holidays", "Wildlife holidays", "Walking holidays", "Food and drink", "Travel"], "sentences": ["Floating on the outer edge of Asia, looking west towards Red China and east into the blue Pacific, Taiwan has many ways of lifting the spirits.", "Beyond its shores, the island is known for its unresolved, peaceful stand-off with Beijing, which regards Taiwan as a &quot;renegade province&quot; \u2013 the dispute dates back to the Communist victory in the Chinese civil war.", "It boasts a democratically elected government, a robust devotion to capitalism, and a cutting-edge, hi-tech export-led economy that has rendered &quot;Made in Taiwan&quot; a globally recognisable marque.", "Today, a gradual improvement in relations between Taiwan and its giant neighbour is producing beneficial spin-offs, direct and indirect.", "Chinese tourism to Taiwan is booming.", "And in March, Taiwan-based China Airlines launched the first non-stop flight to Taiwan from the UK, with a new thrice-weekly service from Heathrow.", "There is the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, a truly monumental, permanent tribute to the founding father of the Republic of China (Taiwan&apos;s official name).", "The National Palace Museum is home to the crown jewels of imperial China, brought to Taiwan from the mainland by Chiang&apos;s fleeing nationalists.", "But when city life begins to pall, Taiwan offers something else, something more that is sometimes amazing.", "Mile after mile of narrow, twisting road tracks the tumbling, aquamarine waters of the Liwu river as it descends from a host of snow-capped mountains, including one of Taiwan&apos;s highest, Mount Nanhu, at 3,742m.", "It follows a route developed by the Japanese imperial army during its pre-1945 occupation of Taiwan.", "Like Taiwan&apos;s other aboriginal tribes, they have mostly lost their birthright.", "One hour on the high-speed train to Taichung, then an hour&apos;s drive into the mountains, away from the industrialised, built-up coastal strip, brought me, round a final bend, to a memorable sight: the shimmering waters of famous Sun Moon Lake, a small, hidden sea in the heart of Taiwan, a secret Xanadu encircled by mountains.", "As ever, Taiwan is more than it seems."], "title": "Taiwan: tea and tranquillity", "article": "High above the noisy concrete and aluminium boulevards of Taipei, way beyond the city&apos;s vertiginous skyscrapers, neon lights and elevated high-speed railway tracks, almost floating in the clouds, distinct and apart, as if in another world, lies a garden of heavenly peace. Its name is the Hongmuwu (Red Wood) Tea House, and it sits in the wooded hills above Taipei, its sudden tranquillity contrasting with the earnest urban bustle below. A soothing tonic for the worn of mind and spirit. Seated on a shaded wooden chair beside a tinkling fountain that fed pools flickering with orange and silver carp, I watched Hongmuwu&apos;s jolly proprietress initiate afternoon tea with smiles and signs. First, she poured boiling water into a large, brown, earthenware teapot with a bamboo handle. The pot was already primed with the famous, locally grown tie guan yin tea. This first infusion was poured off and more water was added. Then a second teapot came into play, round china cups were warmed and, after the requisite brewing period, the contents were transferred again, this time into a small jug. All this was done swiftly and deftly. Small bowls of sugared cashews, dried mango and sweet tea plums appeared on the table. As at last the dark, light-tasting liquid was poured out, great beams of sunshine lanced down into the valleys below. The city&apos;s glass and steel glistened from afar. Tea was served. Tie guan yin, the best known Chinese oolong tea, can be translated as &quot;iron goddess of mercy&quot;, an appropriate name given that the most-fun way to reach the Hongmuwu Tea House high in the wooded hills above Taipei, is via a 4km cable-car ride that tops 300m at its highest point. Gondolas carrying up to eight people climb from the Jingmei river basin near Taipei Zoo station in a half-hour ride over treetops and gulleys to Maokong station. Numerous tea houses, temples, gardens and walking trails are then within easy reach. Floating on the outer edge of Asia, looking west towards Red China and east into the blue Pacific, Taiwan has many ways of lifting the spirits. Beyond its shores, the island is known for its unresolved, peaceful stand-off with Beijing, which regards Taiwan as a &quot;renegade province&quot; \u2013 the dispute dates back to the Communist victory in the Chinese civil war. It boasts a democratically elected government, a robust devotion to capitalism, and a cutting-edge, hi-tech export-led economy that has rendered &quot;Made in Taiwan&quot; a globally recognisable marque. It has world-class healthcare, an impressive high-speed rail network, and ambitions to become an Asian transport hub. Today, a gradual improvement in relations between Taiwan and its giant neighbour is producing beneficial spin-offs, direct and indirect. Chinese tourism to Taiwan is booming. Bilateral trade and investment are growing. And in March, Taiwan-based China Airlines launched the first non-stop flight to Taiwan from the UK, with a new thrice-weekly service from Heathrow. Downtown Taipei is a busy, modern-looking city that combines the energetic feel of Tokyo with an American-style grid system. But there is a lot more beneath the glitz. There is the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, a truly monumental, permanent tribute to the founding father of the Republic of China (Taiwan&apos;s official name). Among the displays are photographs of the great man with Churchill, Roosevelt, Eisenhower and Nixon. His 50s armoured Cadillac is preserved in all its glory, as is the Order of the Bath, presented to him by British admirers. The National Palace Museum is home to the crown jewels of imperial China, brought to Taiwan from the mainland by Chiang&apos;s fleeing nationalists. I found it a place of great beauty, art and abounding treasure \u2013 a bit like the Tower of London, the National Gallery and the V&amp;A rolled into one. Taipei 101, until recently the world&apos;s tallest building, should not be missed: its elevators, travelling at about 60km/h are the fastest in the world, according to the Guinness Book of Records. At the top is a giant, suspended damper, designed to compensate for unwanted movement caused by earthquakes (the last big one was in 1999). And a walk on Taipei&apos;s wild side is incomplete without a visit to the Night Market in Shinlin district. Pig blood cakes, stinking tofu, coconut dough rolls, oyster omelettes, meat and spring onion steamed dumplings, and bitter melon juice drinks are some of the myriad delicacies (and staples) on sale amid much noisy chatter and startlingly low prices. Once sated, the itinerant gaijin (foreign) gourmet can try his luck at fairground shooting ranges or lose her shirt at mah jong. But when city life begins to pall, Taiwan offers something else, something more that is sometimes amazing. A cheap, 35-minute domestic flight south and east to Hualien county, then a short drive into the Taroko national park, brought me into the heart of the spectacular Taroko gorge. Mile after mile of narrow, twisting road tracks the tumbling, aquamarine waters of the Liwu river as it descends from a host of snow-capped mountains, including one of Taiwan&apos;s highest, Mount Nanhu, at 3,742m. The rock here is sheer marble, massive, glistening and immovable \u2013 until an imperceptible tremor sends sharp shards crashing to the road. Signs warn, with good reason, &quot;Do Not Linger&quot;. Hard hats are de rigueur. The national park offers numerous walking trails, and the gorge is home to a wide range of plants, mammals, over-sized butterflies and birds, including tiny swallows that have colonised the many caves along the trail. The road runs through tunnels cut at great human cost by Chiang&apos;s demobilised soldiers. It follows a route developed by the Japanese imperial army during its pre-1945 occupation of Taiwan. But the Japanese were interlopers here, too. Historically speaking, this land belonged to the indigenous Taroko (Truku) people, a Pacific islander race, now dispossessed like so many of their kind. At the Buluowan recreation area, roughly half-way up the gorge, their cultural heritage, or what&apos;s left of it, can be seen in reception area displays and for sale in handicraft shops. Buluowan, meaning &quot;echo&quot;, is a magical place, a natural river terrace surrounded by the almost vertical heavily wooded cliffs that the Taroko made their home. Like Taiwan&apos;s other aboriginal tribes, they have mostly lost their birthright. But high in this enchanted gorge, their spirits linger, defying the signs. The magical feel of the region was continued in the serene environs of the Silks Place hotel, high in the Taroko gorge, a haven of inimitable calm, soft carpets, luxurious massage, hushed dining and elegantly minimalist Japanese-style rooms. As I lay there with the screen doors drawn back, listening to the susurrating rush of the mountain stream, thinking randomly of the day&apos;s Buddhist temples and shaven monks, monkeys, hawks and incense, of lost dynasties of tattooed head-hunters chased out of their land, sleep came easily, an escape within an escape. South and west from Taipei the vistas are dramatically different. One hour on the high-speed train to Taichung, then an hour&apos;s drive into the mountains, away from the industrialised, built-up coastal strip, brought me, round a final bend, to a memorable sight: the shimmering waters of famous Sun Moon Lake, a small, hidden sea in the heart of Taiwan, a secret Xanadu encircled by mountains. This also is a place of trails and walking tours, cycle rides and boat trips, hotels and souvenir shops. But in aboriginal lore it is a holy place, too. This is where Chiang Kai-shek, by then an old man and dun dictatin&apos;, sat and contemplated all his works, like a latter-day Kubla Khan, listening for ancestral voices prophesying war. Sun Moon Lake is where Chiang&apos;s personal stately pleasure dome, now transformed into the ultra-luxurious Lalu hotel, is situated. The hotel is worth the journey by itself. Its exquisite three-room suites with their shuttered balconies, its unbroken views across the lake to far-off pagodas and misted hills, its polished Burmese teak floors, its fishponds, lilies, and Japanese bonsai, its terraced restaurants and spas and, most of all, its modest, self-effacing architectural style combine to produce an almost transformative experience (at a price). Lapping gently in the early morning air, shaded by newly greening frangipani trees and red hibiscus blossom, the blue-green, over-spilling waters of the Lalu&apos;s long outdoor pool seem to merge seamlessly with lake and sky. For a moment, it was as if I was floating free, man and nature made one. Of course, it is a trick of the eye, a conceit of the heart. Or is it? As ever, Taiwan is more than it seems."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2010/apr/10/worlds-worst-air-disasters-timeline", "publicationDate": "2010-05-22T12:11:00Z", "tags": ["Plane crashes", "Air transport", "World news"], "sentences": ["February 1998: A China Airlines Airbus A300 crashes on landing at the airport in Taipei, Taiwan, leaving 203 dead.", "May 2002: A China Airlines Boeing 747 breaks apart in mid-air and crashes into the Taiwan Strait, killing 225 people."], "title": "Timeline: The world's worst air disasters", "article": "March 1974: A Turkish Airlines flight crashes near Paris after a rear cargo door that had not been closed properly blows out.

Hatoyama said he would honour a 2006 agreement with the US to move Futenma base from its current location in an overcrowded city to an offshore site in a less populated part of Okinawa, despite strong local opposition. After six months of searching for a new site in other parts of Japan, Hatoyama conceded that the Korean crisis, sparked by the March sinking of a South Korean naval vessel blamed on a North Korean torpedo, had underlined the importance of the US military presence. &quot;I decided that it is of utmost importance that we place the Japan-US relationship on a solid footing of mutual trust, considering the situation on the Korean peninsula and in Asia,&quot; he said. &quot;I apologise from the bottom of my heart for the confusion I have caused the people of Okinawa.&quot; The US had refused to budge from its insistence that the base, home to 2,000 marines, should stay on Okinawa, which it regards as the best location for troops who could be sent to intervene in a conflict on the Korean peninsula or between China and Taiwan. Under the agreement, 8,000 US troops on Okinawa will be moved to the US Pacific territory of Guam by 2014. The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, commended Hatoyama and described his change of heart as difficult but correct. In an attempt to calm the anger among Okinawan residents, Hatoyama said attempts would be made to lessen the environmental impact of the offshore base. But local leaders described his volte-face as a betrayal. The mayor of Nago, the coastal town that will host the new base, described the plan as &quot;absolutely unacceptable&quot;. &quot;I cannot help feeling angry as this is a betrayal of the people of Nago and Okinawa,&quot; Susumu Inamine told Hatoyama in a meeting yesterday. Despite the agreement between Tokyo and Washington, some analysts believe the plan could still fail amid growing opposition on the island, which hosts about half of the 50,000 US troops in Japan. Minoru Morita, a veteran political commentator, said Hatoyama&apos;s mishandling of the relocation had exposed his Democratic party as naive. &quot;The Okinawan people are outraged,&quot; he said. &quot;They feel Hatoyama betrayed them. The Democrats didn&apos;t think through what they could change and what they couldn&apos;t change. The base issue is an international agreement. They are ignorant and irrational.&quot; Hatoyama could pay a heavy political price for his perceived lack of leadership.

The list is compiled to help governments and multi-national companies compensate employees fairly when placing them on international assignments.

An honourable 2-2 draw, although I am not sure if Greece had any assistance from the rest of the EU.&quot; The OECD&apos;s chief economist told Reuters that a return to recession is unlikely in Europe. He argued that the euro&apos;s recent slide, which makes eurozone exports cheaper, should help offset the impact of governments&apos; austerity measures on economic growth. The euro has lost about 14% against the dollar this year, and more than 10% against a trade-weighted basket of currencies. Pier Carlo Padoan argued that governments need to get a grip on bulging deficits while also reforming pension systems, labour and other markets, and show they are working in unison to convince sceptical financial markets that their strategy is credible. &quot;Is there going to be a double-dip [recession] in Europe? I don&apos;t think so,&quot; said Padoan, who added that massive debts following the deepest global downturn in decades were &quot;not just a European story&quot;, but one that Europe was about to tackle faster than others. Eurozone exporters should benefit from rising foreign demand, especially in Asia, helped by the euro&apos;s weakening, he said. &quot;If you combine the two \u2013 high growth in Asia and a weaker euro \u2013 that could add quite a boost to European exports,&quot; said Padoan. &quot;The weak euro, in the short- to medium-term, is a welcome development. &quot;In any case it would be good for the global economy if ... nominal exchange rates changed a little bit. The euro certainly has been overvalued for some time and the renminbi has certainly been undervalued for some time.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/28/foxconn-plant-china-deaths-suicides", "publicationDate": "2010-05-28T18:35:37Z", "tags": ["China", "Manufacturing sector", "Business", "Taiwan", "Technology", "Apple", "Dell", "Sony", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Foxconn"], "sentences": ["To stem an epidemic of workers leaping to their deaths, the Taiwanese electronics company Foxconn \u2013 which works with Apple, Dell and Sony \u2013 has also pledged to raise salaries by 20% and offered counselling to its 420,000 employees here.", "On Wednesday, the billionaire president of Foxconn, Terry Gou \u2013 Taiwan&apos;s richest man \u2013 said the problem was so bad that he had trouble sleeping because he feared the phone would ring with news of another death."], "title": "Foxconn offers pay rises and suicide nets as fears grow over wave of deaths", "article": "Construction workers began erecting anti-suicide nets today at an industrial plant in southern China that makes millions of the world&apos;s mobile phones and computers. Five-metre long steel poles were bolted into the walls below the roofs to support webbing that will eventually cover 1.5m square metres. To stem an epidemic of workers leaping to their deaths, the Taiwanese electronics company Foxconn \u2013 which works with Apple, Dell and Sony \u2013 has also pledged to raise salaries by 20% and offered counselling to its 420,000 employees here. Though far less well known than the brands it assembles, Foxconn is the world&apos;s biggest contract maker of IT goods, including iPhones and Motorola displays. Its mega-facility at Longhua, Guangdong province, so dominates the local economy that officials pay little heed to complaints by labour groups of secrecy, military discipline and low wages. But a harsh new light has been cast on these problems in recent months by a spate of suicides and allegations of murder. After the death of a worker in January, at least a dozen employees have jumped from buildings in and around the complex. The problem appears to be growing worse. There were two cases in March, three in April and six in May. On Wednesday, the billionaire president of Foxconn, Terry Gou \u2013 Taiwan&apos;s richest man \u2013 said the problem was so bad that he had trouble sleeping because he feared the phone would ring with news of another death. Hours later that is exactly what happened. A day later, another worker reportedly slashed his wrists. Psychologists note that suicides often come in clusters. Given its size, the rate of self-killing at Foxconn is not necessarily far from China&apos;s relatively high average. But the current outbreak has several disturbing characteristics. The first death, that of Ma Xiangqian, occurred on 23 January and still remains shrouded in mystery. The battered body of the 19-year-old migrant from Henan was found outside a company building in the wake of a dispute with his manager. Ma&apos;s family allege that he was murdered. After being forced to clean toilets for a week, they claim Ma was held by Foxconn guards for two days, beaten to death and his body thrown off a roof. &quot;There was a bruise on his arms and injuries on his wrist. Foxconn have never given us a proper explanation, nor even shown us where he is supposed to have jumped from,&quot; said his sister, Ma Hui. &quot;He told me he was unhappy because of the manager, and he was planning to quit.&quot; Foxconn rejects these allegations and police say there is no evidence of murder. Whatever the cause of Ma&apos;s death though, the damage to Foxconn&apos;s reputation was enormous. Perhaps for this reason, when a second employee plunged to his death in March, word quickly spread that the company had paid extra compensation to keep the family quiet. Foxconn has not confirmed this, but other cases followed. The motives are unknown, but a statistical analysis suggests the difficulty of adjusting to a new city and new job may well have been a factor. The 12 known deaths since June were all of migrant employees in the 19-24 age range. Most of the eight men and four women were in their first job since leaving school. Half had been there for less than four months. Most leapt from Foxconn buildings. Some employees blame the spirit-sapping work at the plant. &quot;It&apos;s very tough,&quot; said Liu Jichang, a 19-year-old migrant from Guangxi province, who earns 2,000 yuan (\u00a3200) a month polishing the cases of Apple computers 10 hours a day, 6 days a week. &quot;We are not allowed to talk while we are working. In any case, it is too noisy to have a conversation.&quot; Heading to their crowded dormitory after a night shift, several workers said pressure and the frequent scolding by management might be factors. But opinion was divided. The majority said the pay and conditions were better than elsewhere in Guangdong. Foxconn is proud of the fact that it provides a swimming pool and other facilities to its staff, as well as organising chess, calligraphy, mountain climbing and fishing. Labour activists, however, said few workers have time to indulge. &quot;It&apos;s certainly not the worst place to work in China, but it&apos;s far from being the best,&quot; said Geoff Crothall, of Hong Kong-based campaign group China Labour Bulletin. &quot;They pay on time according to legal rates, but apart from that, it&apos;s the same old story of workers having to put in excessively long hours to make a living wage. At Foxconn, there is also a quasi-military style of management that seeks to isolate individual workers. They actively discourage social interaction.&quot; Others believe that motives included not just misery and revenge, but also a grim pragmatism. &quot;Many people believe they did it for the money,&quot; said Li, a doctor at the clinic outside the factory gates. &quot;The families of the victims have been promised more than 400,000 yuan. That&apos;s more than the workers could expect to earn over their entire lives so they might have thought that by jumping, they could solve all of their family&apos;s financial problems.&quot; This may have been the case for Liang Chao \u2013 a 21-year-old migrant from Anhui province, who had been at Foxconn for six months before his body was found outside his dormitory. His family said they had no inkling he might be depressed. Liang appeared to be satisfied with his job as a line manager \u2013 a position recommended by his brother, also an employee. A few hours before his death, Liang called to say he was returning home from a night drinking with friends. He sounded normal. His uncle, Wu Senyan said there was no suspicion of foul play. &quot;We think it was suicide,&quot; he said. &quot;But we cannot understand why he killed himself.&quot; He added: &quot;Foxconn have taken good care of us. According to the law we should get compensation of 10,000 yuan, but they have paid extra.&quot; Though it is far from certain that the wave of suicides at Foxconn was economically motivated, the company&apos;s recent actions suggest they consider this a real possibility. Earlier this week, managers tried to make staff sign a declaration that the company would not be liable for extra compensation beyond the legal requirement. And this morning the firm raised the base salary by 20%, which labour activists say will keep it narrowly ahead or in line with a rise in the minimum wage. These two measures appear designed to persuade employees that they are worth more alive than dead, at least compared with the start of the week. But even as suicide nets were being erected, newly arrived migrants from the countryside were queueing up outside the factory to apply for jobs. &quot;I&apos;ve been waiting for three days,&quot; said Wu Zongying, 20, from Henan. &quot;I really want a job here. It&apos;s better pay than the shoe factory where I used to work. I&apos;ve heard about the suicides but I&apos;m not worried. Nobody made those people jump. They were unhappy. They should have just left. I don&apos;t really understand it.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/may/31/iped-ipad-android-tablet-computers", "publicationDate": "2010-05-31T22:07:29Z", "tags": ["Mobile phones", "Tablet computers", "Apple", "iPad", "Google", "Technology"], "sentences": ["However, I expect some rather more expensive devices will be shown at this week&apos;s Computex trade show in Taiwan, starting with MSI&apos;s Wind Pad 110, which has an ARM processor running Google&apos;s Android mobile phone operating system."], "title": "iPed versus iPad: looking for Android tablets", "article": "     If anyone&apos;s coming back from China, I hope they&apos;re bringing back an iPed, as reported on Japanese TV news.

However, I expect some rather more expensive devices will be shown at this week&apos;s Computex trade show in Taiwan, starting with MSI&apos;s Wind Pad 110, which has an ARM processor running Google&apos;s Android mobile phone operating system. Acer, Dell and Lenovo are also tipped to enter the market at some point.According to The Wall Street Journal: &quot;Bob Morris, ARM&apos;s director of mobile computing, says his company is tracking about 40 tablet-style devices being designed with ARM-based chips, plus about 10 more e-reader devices for electronic books. He estimated that &apos;upwards of half&apos; are based on Android.&quot; Apple&apos;s iPad is basically an iPod Touch XL, so I don&apos;t see any reason why Google&apos;s mobile phone software should not be similarly upscaled for the mid-sized tablet format. It might not have the polish of Apple&apos;s software, but polish isn&apos;t everything. There are other things in life, including diversity and freedom of choice, as well as price. The point is that where Apple&apos;s system is proprietary and closed, Google&apos;s is based on open source Linux, and you can license it. Instead of users being limited to one basic tablet from one supplier, and a single censored marketplace for approved apps, Android will enable thousands of manufacturers and software developers to compete for sales. Some people find freedom of choice is just too hard for them to handle, of course, but the (relatively) more open system could eventually triumph, as Microsoft MS DOS (aka IBM PC DOS) and Windows did over Apple&apos;s Mac OS in the 1980s and 1990s. And while no one knows if this will actually happen, it already seems likely that Android phones will outsell Apple iPhones. Either way, as the FT&apos;s Tech blog says: &quot;Everyone&apos;s eager to capitalise on the iPad&apos;s technological shortcomings.&quot; Well, Apple has left lots of room for competition. For a start, there&apos;s the chance to provide cloud-based systems that don&apos;t demand to be attached to a personal computer running Apple&apos;s iTunes for synchronisation.  The first version of the iPad also has lots of hardware and software limitations, including the annoying lack of multi-tasking for third-party apps, lack of Adobe Flash (not even as a user-selected option), the mysteriously missing webcam for Skype, the lack of a USB port or an SD card slot, and so on. Apple has probably left out some of these useful features in order to create a market for an upgraded iPad to be released in 18-24 months, but it means rivals can easily offer these things first. There are, of course, lots of alternatives to Android in the slate market. Some manufacturers already sell, or might sell, tablets that run different versions of Linux (including Nokia and Intel&apos;s MeeGo), Windows CE Embedded or Windows 7, or even Palm&apos;s WebOS, now owned by HP. Also, some tablets will be based on ARM chips such as Snapdragon or Tegra, and some on Intel Atom chips, depending on whether they&apos;re small versions of laptop computers or big versions of mobile phones.  However, Google has already singled out Apple as the dictatorial 1984-style enemy of freedom in the smartphone market (an amusing twist on Apple&apos;s attack on IBM), and this war looks likely to be continued in the &quot;overgrown smartphone&quot; part of the tablet market. One key problem is that Google specified Android for screens up to about 7 inches, presumably thinking that the stripped-down web-oriented Chrome OS would be used on devices with bigger screens. But if Google isn&apos;t hammering out a new tablet &quot;device profile&quot; based on XGA (1024 x 768 pixel) screens, I&apos;ll be very disappointed. * Update: On Twitter, androidpads has pointed to the Moonse e7001 aka iRobot as an earlier example."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/01/lost-movies-edinburgh-film-festival", "publicationDate": "2010-06-01T18:24:32Z", "tags": ["Edinburgh film festival", "Film", "Edinburgh", "Scotland", "UK news", "Albert Finney"], "sentences": ["Also listed are films by Werner Herzog, Koji Wakamatsu, Juan Jos\u00e9 Campanella, Steven Soderbergh and Rafi Pitts, while films from France, Canada, Mexico, Taiwan and Japan are being featured."], "title": "Edinburgh film festival to screen 'lost and forgotten' British movies", "article": "A batch of &quot;lost and forgotten&quot; British films, made more than 30 years ago by many of the industry&apos;s leading figures, including Ken Russell, Stephen Frears and Albert Finney, is to be screened at this year&apos;s Edinburgh film festival. The retrospective of 16 rarely seen British-made and directed films from between 1967 and 1979, which have been rediscovered after more than a year&apos;s detective work by the event&apos;s staff, is expected to be a highlight of the festival, which opens in two weeks. Some are being shown for the first time in decades, as many of the films, including Savage Messiah made by Ken Russell in 1972 and starring Helen Mirren, the children&apos;s detective story What Next, and the original cut of Robert Fuest&apos;s The Final Programme, starring Jon Finch, have never been released on video or DVD. The mini-season, called Retrospective: After the Wave, also features three classic films from the publicly funded Children&apos;s Film Foundation, including The Boy Who Turned Yellow from 1972 by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, and Glitterball from 1977, starring a painted ping-pong ball as an alien silver orb from outer space, which has been likened to an early ET. Hannah Gill, the festival&apos;s artistic director, said: &quot;I think this is a fantastic retrospective. I think it&apos;s particularly interesting, at a time which is quite difficult for retrospectives because people have huge access to past movies, finding a set of films that people genuinely can&apos;t get hold of. &quot;We were interested in the fact there was a lag in iconic British cinema between the &quot;new wave&quot; [of the 1960s] and the art cinema of the 1980s. There&apos;s a mysterious period; people see it as a period which was largely about James Bond and Carry On films, which was slightly trashy, but there were directors interested in serious and important work.&quot; The strand makes up one of several themes in this year&apos;s 64th film festival. After watching 1,500 feature films and 2,500 short films, Gill and her colleagues have chosen a programme of 133 features from 34 countries which will include 22 world premieres, nine European premieres and 63 UK premieres. Among the highest-profile events will be the UK premiere of Sylvain Chomet&apos;s animation The Illusionist, based in Scotland from a script by Jacques Tati, a special gala screening of Sir Sean Connery&apos;s favourite movie, The Man Who Would Be King, and the closing night gala, Third Star, the first feature-length film by the Bafta-winning short film-maker Hattie Dalton. Also listed are films by Werner Herzog, Koji Wakamatsu, Juan Jos\u00e9 Campanella, Steven Soderbergh and Rafi Pitts, while films from France, Canada, Mexico, Taiwan and Japan are being featured. The Shakespearan actor turned Star Trek leading man Sir Patrick Stewart is chairing this year&apos;s Michael Powell award jury and is the focus of the Bafta Scotland interview. Gill said the lost and forgotten series dovetailed neatly with the festival&apos;s other goal of finding and promoting new and young British film-makers; an antidote to the focus on star-studded &quot;red carpet&quot; events which dominate many festivals. The festival will feature 21 new British films, most of which do not have distribution deals and are made by undiscovered directors. &quot;It will be really interesting to have these new young directors around with Mike [Hodges], Stephen [Frears] and Sean Connery. So it&apos;s different generations of British cinema. &quot;I&apos;m really pleased by our building up of the number of first and second-time film-makers, which was really important for us when we rebranded ourselves as the festival of discovery. &quot;We do find there are wee gems that no one has picked up on.&quot; Niall Greig Fulton, one of the curators of the retrospective, said there were numerous films of historical and critical importance. Pressure (1976), is the first British film made by a black director, Horace Ov\u00e9, while the early feature by Michael Apted, The Squeeze (1977), starring Stacy Keach, was &quot;the grittiest British thriller ever made&quot;, and Savage Messiah (1972) was Russell&apos;s &quot;most subtle and, to me, his best film,&quot; Fulton said. He added: &quot;They&apos;re all films that deserve to be seen by a new audience and hopefully included in that will be a new generation of film-makers.&quot; Tickets go on sale at noon on Thursday. www.edfilmfest.org.uk  Lost and forgotten Glitterball: Made by the Children&apos;s Film Foundation in 1977, this low-budget precursor to ET features an alien silver orb (a painted ping pong ball) befriended by two young boys. It can eat through anything and is coveted by a local thief The Hard Way: Directed by Michael Dryhurst in 1979, it stars Patrick McGoohan as a rural hitman hired by an American financier, Lee Van Cleef. A &quot;minimalist&quot; thriller, it has a soundtrack by Brian Eno. Gumshoe: The first feature by Stephen Frears, made in 1971, it stars Albert Finney as a Liverpool private eye in a &quot;postmodern dismantling of the American detective genre&quot;, with Billie Whitelaw and Frank Finlay co-starring. It has a score by Andrew Lloyd Webber.

But they all carried different, and obviously fake, addresses. Several regional papers in Britain published his letter, including the Derby Telegraph (where he claimed to live at Friar Gate), the Brighton Argus (Western Road), and the Grimsby Telegraph (Cleethorpes). No national title did so, as far as I can see. But &quot;Frank&quot; popped up all over the States - from the Baltimore Sun, to the Washington Times and on to the Colorado Springs Gazette. Then you can find his letter in Ireland&apos;s The Examiner, in theTimes of Malta and in several Canadian papers, such as Vancouver&apos;s The Province. This man certainly moves around because he manages also to have addresses in South Korea, the Virgin Islands and Taiwan. Google him and you&apos;ll see he has managed to get his letter into more than 100 papers around the globe.  Some papers carried outraged responses from readers. One published a comment from a health editor. One was moved enough to write a leading article. So what did &quot;Frank&quot; write? Here&apos;s the version from the Trenton Times in New Jersey (most are exactly the same):  Last month was the 50th anniversary of &quot;the pill.&quot; In the 1960s, the birth control pill was heralded as a development that would liberate women from male dominance and lead to fewer divorces, fewer unwanted pregnancies and fewer abortions. It is now clear, however, that things did not turn out that way. As the pill became more widespread, the number of divorces and abortions soared. We saw a lowering of moral standards and a rise in infidelity and promiscuity. In addition, the well-being of children declined by a variety of measures, from depression to diet to the number living in poverty and the number experiencing child abuse or neglect. Though women now have access to places and positions that once belonged only to men, they have never been seen more as sex objects than they are today. The major disconnect caused by the arrival of the pill has been a loss of the idea that men and women make babies. As technological advances in artificial reproduction are made, the idea that God plays a role in procreation has increasingly been lost. Sadly, the horizon does not look promising for the family. With the rapid increase in activist judges with a proclivity for elitist social engineering, we will soon be seeing countless forms of sexually bonded groups that are not only unstable but seriously harmful to children. May God help us.  So I guess &quot;Frank&quot; is representing himself as a conservative Christian and anti-feminist who hates the modern world.  As Danny Bloom (who discovered the scam) points out in his I see from the snailpapers blog, the letter was published &quot;without one editor checking to see if FH was a real name or where he really lived or where he really was writing from or if he REALLY was a reader of said newspaper.&quot;            And the mention of the wonderful Mr Bloom prompts me to post his snailpaper song. &quot;O life is just one long newspaper caper...&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/17/china-greece-power", "publicationDate": "2010-06-17T16:30:42Z", "tags": ["China", "Greece", "International trade", "Global economy", "Globalisation", "Economics", "World news", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["American commentators suggest this is already happening in relation to Taiwan and, increasingly, in Beijing&apos;s attempts to dominate the South China sea."], "title": "The Chinese behemoth awakes | Simon Tisdall", "article": "China&apos;s forceful intervention in the Greek debt crisis this week has given harassed European leaders meeting at today&apos;s EU summit a sharp reminder of the challenges posed by Beijing&apos;s relentless, expansive, and not always benign pursuit of global interest and influence. What was seen in Athens as a potential financial lifeline was, for others, a troubling sign of a future made in China. Chinese vice-premier Zhang Dejiang agreed shipping, tourism and telecommunications deals worth several billion euros during the second visit to Athens in four weeks by a high-ranking Beijing official. The investment package, reportedly the biggest ever by China in Europe, was a welcome shot in the arm for the beleaguered Greek government. But Radio Free Europe commentator Breffni O&apos;Rourke highlighted the intervention&apos;s wider significance for Europe as a whole. &quot;The Chinese are hard-headed realists and they recognise in Greece the ideal portal for exports to the Balkans. They have decided to establish a bridgehead there at a moment when the terms are most favourable,&quot; he said. Another example of China&apos;s lengthening reach was this week&apos;s report that state-controlled PetroChina might consider a takeover bid for BP, whose share price has plunged following the Gulf of Mexico spill. Such a takeover would create a giant company with 73% more oil reserves than ExxonMobil and 187% more than Shell. By way of counterbalance, China&apos;s firmly rooted reluctance to support policies inimical to its economic prospects and geopolitical influence has also been on display. Tough sanctions on Iran agreed by the EU this week specifically prohibit new energy sector investment and sales. But German manufacturers predict that Chinese firms that suffer no such official inhibitions and are already big investors in Iran will simply supplant European businesses. Beijing is nothing if not consistent. It successfully forced the Security Council to water down the latest UN sanctions against Tehran. It is pressing ahead with a deal to build two civilian nuclear reactors in Pakistan despite western proliferation concerns. And it has steadfastly refused to condemn its nuclear armed ally, North Korea, for the March sinking of a South Korean naval vessel. A report published this week by the independent London-based thinktank, the European Council on Foreign Relations, discerns an increasingly negative pattern in Chinese behaviour, which, it claims, poses a &quot;huge test&quot; for Europe. It&apos;s time EU leaders woke up to the scale and escalating seriousness of the global challenge posed by Beijing and took a tougher line, the report&apos;s author, Fran\u00e7ois Godement, said. &quot;Chinese foreign policy experts saw the collapse of Lehman Brothers not as a one-off crisis but as a structural change in the distribution of power. Since then, China has become assertive across a range of foreign policy issues,&quot; the report said. &quot;China has repeatedly snubbed Europeans [over] Tibet. It has become even less apologetic about its human rights violations, has deepened economic ties with North Korea \u2026 and slowed down progress on Iran. &quot;At the Copenhagen climate conference, China used tough tactics to [prevent] an agreement on a binding commitment for developing countries \u2026 In short, China has frustrated hopes for increased global responsibility-sharing while pursuing its own economic and strategic interests.&quot; Godement argued that European assumptions that China would adopt modern, western-style &quot;values and interests&quot; as it developed into a modern, global power were now daily exposed as flawed. If anything, he said, China was pursuing a &quot;normless&quot; or values-free foreign policy with &quot;minimal&quot; commitment to upholding the international order. It was not so much interested in multilateral agreements brokered through the UN or the global trading system as in subregional and bilateral deals furthering its national aims. One example is last week&apos;s gas pipeline agreement with Kazakhstan, part of Beijing&apos;s ambitious energy strategy in central Asia. But there are many others, including its deep-water port-building projects in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan, trade deals in south-east Asia, and numerous bilateral resource projects in African countries. The EU should adopt a hard-nosed, conditional and unified approach to China to have any chance of holding its own on the issues that matter most to Europeans, such as climate change, proliferation, human rights, and trade and investment, the report concluded. That said, it seems increasingly clear that Europe, like the US, must prepare for the day when China seeks physically to protect its burgeoning interests with &quot;hard power&quot;. American commentators suggest this is already happening in relation to Taiwan and, increasingly, in Beijing&apos;s attempts to dominate the South China sea. &quot;It is not that China has a masterplan for world domination. Rather, like all rising powers (19th-century America included), the logic of its growth requires it to play a greater international role,&quot; wrote Daniel Blumenthal on the Foreign Policy magazine website. Sooner or later, he predicted, China would develop expeditionary land forces to defend its interests in the region and in strategic areas like central Asia. Greece is probably safe for now. But it wouldn&apos;t do to be complacent."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/26/shanghai-china-superconsumer-big-business", "publicationDate": "2010-06-25T23:02:32Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Environment", "Society", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["In the cigar lounge, Emily introduces me to a French food and beverage manager, Julian Desmettre, who describes how the nouveau riche from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore have made the city their playground: &quot;Shanghai is like Paris during la belle \u00e9poque."], "title": "China: The next superconsumer?", "article": "The resident of 550 Huaihai Road in Shanghai is a rather unusual migrant. Born in Wisconsin on 9\u00a0March 1959, Barbara Millicent Roberts is the world&apos;s most famous supermodel. She drives a Corvette convertible, owns a dream home with a pool, parties with jocks and adores shopping. In the US,\u00a0she was a\u00a0prom queen and a role model. In\u00a0China, she is emerging as an ambassador for consumer culture. Better known as Barbie, this 30cm-tall icon was first sold in China in the early 1990s, but it was not until 2009 that she was given her own home in the retail heartland of Shanghai. Mattel,\u00a0the world&apos;s biggest toy company, marked her 50th\u00a0birthday by opening the planet&apos;s largest Barbie emporium. Covered in pink plastic, the six-storey doll&apos;s house on Huaihai Road became an instant landmark. Martial arts star Jet Li and the actor Christy Chung were among the celebrities at its launch. This was more than a party; it was the start of a marketing campaign aimed at prolonging and expanding the lifestyle championed by the toy firm. For the Barbie market to continue to grow for another 50 years, the doll would have to\u00a0make it big in China. When I lunch at Barbie&apos;s place, in the fantastically kitsch restaurant with a menu devised by chef David Laris, it doesn&apos;t seem to be hugely popular. Along with Barbie\u2122 burgers with Barbie\u2122 pink sauce, Ken burgers, pinktastic pasta, doll-icious desserts and Barbie\u2122 tini cocktails, the restaurant boasts generous promotional offers: those opting for the special meal receive a boxed set of Barbie plates and cutlery to take away. I ask Liu Yunting, who works for an advertising company, what she plans to do with her new tableware. &quot;I will use it myself,&quot; she says. Isn&apos;t it a little childish? &quot;Not at all. It is cute. This is much better than the stuff for children. We\u00a0know better how to appreciate it.&quot; Liu is a member of the fastest-growing consumer class: single women \u2013 or xiaobailing (white-collar princesses). They have high levels of disposable income and a craving for designer labels. For marketing moguls, they are the future face of consumer power. State\u00a0planners forecast that half the population will be middle class by 2020. Until recently, China was living within the planet&apos;s means. If everyone in the world consumed what the average Mr or Mrs Wang did in 2007, we&apos;d just about stay within the sustainable resources of our planet. Humanity would have a balanced ecological budget. But, understandably, Mr and Mrs Wang wanted to keep up with Mr and Mrs Jones on the other side of the Pacific. That was human nature. It was also bad news for the environment, because if we all ate, shopped and travelled like those average Americans, we&apos;d need 4.5 Earths.     A mall in Xujiahui, Shanghai. Photograph:  /Reuters    In recent years, the planet&apos;s largest corporations have become dependent on the Wangs catching up with the Joneses. The US had shopped until its economy dropped. Sinking in debt, plagued by obesity and increasingly dependent on military might to protect its lifestyle, the world&apos;s superconsumer was groaning with indigestion. Europe was too decrepit and conservative to take up the slack, so global manufacturers, retailers and restaurant chains were desperate to stimulate the Chinese appetite. Shanghai was their beachhead. While information firms and political lobbyists headed to Beijing and manufacturers flocked to Guangzhou, retail giants almost invariably chose Shanghai for their China headquarters and their first showrooms. From Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald&apos;s and Starbucks to Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Chanel, international brands made the city a giant shopping mall. Shanghai became the biggest, richest, most globalised mass of modernity in China, home to the most luxurious boutiques, the tallest buildings, the nation&apos;s first formula one track, the biggest auto companies, the second busiest port in the world and a gathering horde of international salesmen trying to sell the American consumer lifestyle. Chinese consumers have never had more options. America&apos;s Wal-Mart, France&apos;s Carrefour, Britain&apos;s Tesco and Japan&apos;s Ito Yokado are expanding in China faster than in any other country. Each year, they open hundreds of new stores in the expectation that demand will surge as more rural migrants move into cities and work their way into the middle class. Young urbanites are becoming as enthusiastic about french fries, burgers and fried chicken as their counterparts in New York or London. When the first KFC opened near Tiananmen Square in 1987, it was seen as a novel western dining experience; 20 years later, the company has 2,000 outlets in 400 cities, employing 200,000 people, making it easily the biggest restaurant chain in China. In roughly the same period, McDonald&apos;s had grown from one restaurant to 800. Along with the changing diet came a surge in obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Obese children used to be rare in China; now nearly 15% of the population is overweight. Shanghai is often cited as the worst affected city. Barbie\u2122 burgers and the like are part of an increasingly carnivorous diet. To\u00a0feed its growing livestock, China imports huge quantities of soya, much of it from Brazil, which has resulted in accelerated clearance of Amazonian forest and Cerrado savanna. Like many other wealthy cities, the high-protein, high-octane, jet-set lifestyle is being paid for elsewhere. I meet my guide, Emily Zhang Huijia, a connoisseur of consumption, outside number 18 the Bund. Once the China HQ of Standard Chartered Bank, the Bund is now a centre for shopping, eating and clubbing. Emily is its PR manager. A fashionista since her teens, she has worked for Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel, and says she was brought up on Vogue, Glamour and OK! magazines. By western standards, her childhood was not privileged. In 1985, when she was three, her family got its first colour television. In 1992, around the time the first Barbies went on sale in China, they bought their first air-conditioner; so did everyone in the neighbourhood. The Zhangs had their first fixed phone line installed when Emily was six. By the time she was 16, they were connected to the internet. My family in the UK had a phone three generations before Emily&apos;s, but her parents went online four years earlier than mine. By 2006, the average person in Shanghai owned two mobile phones, 1.7 air-conditioners, 1.7 colour television sets, more than one fridge and spent 14,761 yuan a year (around \u00a31,455), some 70% more than the rest of the country. They use almost twice as much toilet paper as the average in developed nations and have a bigger carbon footprint than people in the UK. The city is consuming beyond the planet&apos;s means, and its appetite is growing by the day. By the time Emily&apos;s generation were earning a salary, they could afford more than the essentials; they could buy style. &quot;I&apos;m a Shanghai girl,&quot; she says. &quot;We don&apos;t earn so much, but we see luxury brands every day. We don&apos;t want to buy anything else.&quot; Most of her friends are in the industry and\u00a0they share information about discounts and sample sales. At her first sale, she blew a third of her salary on Fendi sunglasses. &quot;It is like a fever,&quot; she says. &quot;The price is so low, you cannot refuse.&quot; Like many a proud shopper, Emily lists how much she saved rather than how much she spent. She is wearing a half-price Dior watch reduced by 2,900 yuan (\u00a3286). In her 40 sq m flat near Fuxing Park, she has dozens of other bags, accessories and clothes, including an Armani coat for 999 yuan (\u00a398), discounted from 9,900 (\u00a3976). Compared with friends, she says, she is restrained. In the last three years, Emily&apos;s monthly salary has increased from 3,000 yuan to just under 20,000, putting her firmly in the middle-class bracket. She eats at restaurants at weekends, has a French boyfriend, plays poker every Thursday. Business and pleasure are mixed. Her favourite after-hours hangout, she says, is the building where she works. &quot;Bund 18 has the coolest nightclub in Shanghai, so it&apos;s probably also the coolest in China.&quot; We agree to meet there again at midnight. After dark, the Bund&apos;s spotlit neoclassical pillars and low-rise architecture are reminiscent of London. On the other side of the Huangpu river, however, the futuristic Pudong skyline rises higher than almost anywhere on Earth, including one of the world&apos;s tallest buildings, the 492m bottle opener-shaped Shanghai World Financial Centre. Twenty years ago, most of Pudong was farmland. Today, it pulsates with light and colour. The crowd in the club is made up mostly of expat western men and their Chinese girlfriends. In the cigar lounge, Emily introduces me to a French food and beverage manager, Julian Desmettre, who describes how the nouveau riche from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore have made the city their playground: &quot;Shanghai is like Paris during la belle \u00e9poque. This is the city of wealth and style, where people must show their money, where they are judged by how they dress, where they look down on those with less than themselves.&quot; Julian arrived in Shanghai as a student eight years ago with 5,000 yuan in his pocket. Now, he has on his wrist an Omega watch worth six times that amount. &quot;My life here is better than in France. I have a big apartment, a cleaner, a compound with a pool and a gym. It is so comfortable, it is almost too much.&quot; Most revellers in the lounge are European. &quot;Where can I meet Chinese partygoers?&quot; I\u00a0ask Emily, but she is reluctant to recommend anywhere: &quot;There are clubs, but they are the type of place you&apos;d find in a second-tier city. The music and decor are not as good, but Chinese men prefer them because they don&apos;t want to be near foreigners. Chinese women are different. They are\u00a0more open. They go where the quality is.&quot; Wandering around local bars and restaurants, I\u00a0meet bar owners who organise prostitutes for customers and set up trips to karaoke parlours, where hostesses strip off to sing. Shanghai seems to be emulating the consumer sex industry of Tokyo; the hostess bar scene is reminiscent of Japan at the height of its &quot;bubble economy&quot;. The next day, Emily introduces me to Cindy Tai, the head of a marketing agency and former head of EMI Music in China, who helped organise the first Rolling Stones concert in Shanghai. As a child during the Cultural Revolution, Cindy and her academic parents were sent from Shanghai to a farm on the nearby island of Chongming. &quot;We had enough to eat, but nothing to spare. We were very happy if we got a little meat on the table once a week. My\u00a0parents suffered. I vowed that one day I\u00a0would buy them whatever they wanted.&quot; She has achieved that ambition; now, her dream is &quot;to create an organic farm. I&apos;d like to grow fruit, vegetables and rice, raise pigs and chickens. And to have a helicopter, because the traffic is so bad.&quot; But like many affluent consumers around the world, Cindy&apos;s environmentalism seems selective. She has blueberries delivered from an organic farm, baguettes from a French bakery in Xintiandi and olive oil from Italy. She eats out at least once a day, and at one point she and her French husband had four cars: a BMW, an MG and two Mercs. Now they have two; a sign, she says, of their increasing concern for the planet. Later, however, she reveals that her interest has switched to yachts. One is moored near their second home in Cannes. She may yet get another luxury car. Cindy is a member of the Shanghai Porsche club, mainly to\u00a0keep up with her friends, and has been invited to an awards ceremony hosted by Jaguar. I\u00a0shamelessly ask if I can come along. The venue for the Jaguar Gorgeous Award Party is a renovated mansion off Huaihai Road, a few minutes&apos; walk from the Barbie store. In cocktail dresses and designer suits, guests sip wine in the courtyard, where they are treated to a sales pitch for the new 5-litre XKR: &quot;It is a wow car!&quot; gushes a PR lady who introduces herself by her westernised name, Seraph. I am sceptical: &quot;But you can barely move in Shanghai&apos;s traffic. Why would anyone want such a\u00a0huge engine?&quot; &quot;Rich people never take the subway,&quot; Seraph replies. &quot;Even if the traffic is bad, they need a car. Jaguar is nothing but gorgeous and beautiful.&quot; In the five years to 2009, sales of luxury cars in China rose five-fold, de luxe villas seven-fold and luxury goods tripled. This was just the start of a spending splurge: the number of wealthy households is forecast to double again by 2015. Earthwatch Institute estimates that if China&apos;s 1.3 billion people were to consume at the same rate as Americans, global production of steel, paper and cars would have to double, oil output would need to rise by 20m barrels a day and miners would have to dig an extra 5bn tons of coal. If it followed the US appetite, China would chew its way through 80% of current meat production and two-thirds of the global grain harvest. &quot;China is telescoping history,&quot; says Lester Brown, president of Earthwatch. &quot;It forces us to focus on what happens when huge numbers of low-income people rise rapidly in affluence. Chinese consumption shows the need to reconstruct the world economy.&quot; Instead of relying on an ever greater consumption of resources to generate growth, Brown says mankind needs to move to a fairer, more sustainable model. Yet the opposite seems to be happening. Global corporations and the communist government are trying to make China the greatest shopper of them all. In Shanghai, that goal is already being realised. By one estimate, the average carbon dioxide emissions of its residents have already overtaken those in Tokyo, New York and London. If there is a glimmer of environmental hope, it is that even in Shanghai people have not yet fully embraced western levels of throwaway consumption. Many still prefer flasks of hot tea to cans of Coke, and in the supermarkets the average basket of goods is smaller than in the west and profit margins are lower. This thrift is not inspired by environmental concerns, but by a\u00a0traditional desire to live within one&apos;s means. Even so, the rest of the country has some way to go to catch up with Shanghai, which is what the government wants. This will require a great deal more energy and raw materials. To provide everyone with a Shanghai lifestyle, factories will\u00a0need to churn out an extra 159 million refrigerators, 213 million televisions, 233 million computers, 166 million microwave ovens, 260 million air-conditioners and 187 million cars. The retail market, meanwhile, is becoming less diverse the bigger it grows. Paul French, a Shanghai-based marketing consultant, says the problem is that the shopping malls designed to create the image of a good life do not reflect reality for most people: &quot;They are building more and more malls filled with luxury brands. Like the power stations in Soviet-era Russia, they are being built not because of demand but because of prestige. Every official in China wants one to show their city is on the international map.&quot; These emporiums are designed to generate desire, not meet needs. Many are dismissed by locals as gui gouwu zhongxin (ghost malls) because they attract so few customers. Yet in Shanghai they are everywhere. Xujiahui intersection, for example, is ringed by six department stores. Among them is the Orient Shopping Mall, boasting Est\u00e9e Lauder cosmetics, Rolex watches, Cartier pens and Dior lipstick. Passing through the revolving door one weekday morning, I\u00a0see not a single customer. Not even a window shopper.

Lu Yen-hsun, the world No 82 from Taiwan and son of a chicken catcher, had boasted a best performance at a major of reaching the third round at last year&apos;s Australian Open before he blew Roddick out of SW19 by winning the fifth set 9-7 to reach Wednesday&apos;s quarter-finals, where he faces Novak Djokovic. Lu&apos;s father died in 2000 and this victory was dedicated to him while leaving Roddick confessing he was &quot;pissed off&quot;. The American was seen throwing his racket in fury in the locker-room after the defeat and, in response to some less than sensitive questioning, said: &quot;Of course I&apos;m going to be pissed off when I wake up tomorrow. If you got fired from your job, you probably wouldn&apos;t wake up the next day in a great mood. We&apos;re better than those questions.&quot; Roddick, of course, came close to beating Roger Federer in last year&apos;s memorable final before suffering the heartbreak of losing 14-16 in the fifth set, the third time he had been runner-up for the Wimbledon singles title. Roddick was honest when appraising the need for victory over Lu. He said: &quot;If I want to consider myself a contender for this tournament, I&apos;ve got to get through that match. He [Lu] had a game plan, he stuck to it and he deserved to win more than I did. That&apos;s for sure.&quot; Roddick appeared to have revived his hopes against the 26-year-old Lu by taking a fourth-set tie-break 7-5 to level the match at two sets all. In a contest that featured the long baseline rallies that have replaced serve-and-volley as regulation fare on these lawns both men quickly became conscious that the victor would be whoever could make, and take, any glimmer of a chance. So it was that they marched through the fifth set holding serve until Lu, who knocked Andy Murray out in the opening round of the Beijing Olympics two years ago, prevailed 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 6-7, 9-7. &quot;I know he&apos;s very tough on grass becausehe has big serve,&quot; Lu said of Roddick, who had beaten him on two previous occasions. &quot;I don&apos;t think I [did] any different than last time. I just [concentrated on] my serve when I was in trouble or when I in tough situation [and] I didn&apos;t overplay. I have to stay with him because last two matches, sometimes in the pressure, I overplayed because I want to make a winner. Today I just take time, serve regular and stay with him, try to find a chance and to win the set, set by set, set by set, until the end, I shaking hand and I win.&quot; Asked his overriding emotion at the close of the contest, he said: &quot;For me I [was] really thankful for my family. Also I&apos;m really upset because my father&apos;s passed away I make this result [for him]. I&apos;m really proud to share this victory with him in the sky. I hope he sees this match. &quot;So in that moment, I just sit and tell myself, I done it. I did it for my father.. I did it for myself also. I did for all the people support me.&quot; Lu then revealed his humble beginnings in Taiwan&apos;s capital, Taipei. &quot;My father sold the chicken, not the meat, but the live chicken \u2013 they sell the chicken, to the farm or something [where] they kill it and it becomes the meat. I can catch a chicken \u2013 I can show you \u2013 serious. I tried few times. But I don&apos;t really like because smell really bad. But I know is very tough work.

Photo by hr.icio on Flickr. Some rights reserved Dell sold millions of computers between 2003 and 2005 that had faulty components - specifically, capacitors, according to documents unsealed in a case being heard in the federal court in North Carolina. In an article in the New York Times, Ashlee Vance writes about the problems that Dell faced - and how it tried to prevent them becoming more widely known:   &quot;Documents recently unsealed in a three-year-old lawsuit against Dell show that the company&apos;s employees were actually aware that the computers were likely to break. Still, the employees tried to play down the problem to customers and allowed customers to rely on trouble-prone machines, putting their businesses at risk. Even the firm defending Dell in the lawsuit was affected when Dell balked at fixing 1,000 suspect computers, according to e-mail messages revealed in the dispute.&quot;  The documents do sound fascinating - though so far the only one from the case that that has made it onto the wider web from the case is this one - which is simply a list of documents that are no longer sealed. (The case is being heard at the Federal District Court in North Carolina.) In 2005, Dell announced that it was taking a $300m charge to cover the cost of fixing and/or replacing the faulty machines. The NYT then argues that &quot;The documents chronicling the failure of the PCs also help explain the decline of one of America&apos;s most celebrated and admired companies. Perhaps more than any other company, Dell fought to lower the price of computers.&quot; That may be true - but it&apos;s not the whole story. Dell ran afoul, quite without realising it, of one of the most fascinating pieces of industrial espionage of recent times: the theft of a formula for making the electrolyte to go into capacitors from a Japanese company, which got taken to China, and then onto Taiwan - but somewhere, got messed up. How do I know? Because I wrote about it seven years ago:   &quot;A scientist steals a secret formula for an electrical product from his Japanese employer and takes it to China. Then it is stolen again and turns up in Taiwan. But something goes wrong - and thousands, perhaps millions, of computers and electrical goods in the West begin to burn out or explode.   &quot;It sounds like the plot of a thriller, but it&apos;s reality. Thousands of computers have failed and nobody is sure how many more products might go wrong because their capacitors - essential components to control the power supply - were made with faulty materials.&quot;  In 2001, a scientist - name still unknown - left Rubycon Corporation Japan to go and work for the Luminous Town Electric company in China. Both companies made (among other things) electrolytic capacitors, which are usually used in power circuits. At the LTE Company, the scientist made a copy of the electrolyte - the chemical that goes inside the capacitors and enhances its capacitative properties.  &quot;Later that year, the scientist&apos;s staff defected to Taiwan, taking with them a copy of the electrolyte formula so they could set up their own company. Taiwan supplies 30 per cent of the world&apos;s electrolytic capacitors and most of the big PC manufacturers get their machines assembled in Taiwan. But the defectors mis-copied the formula. After a few hours of operation, the electrolyte would leak hydrogen gas, before bursting the metal body of the capacitor. The electrolyte would then leak its brownish filling and could cause a fire.&quot;  IBM confessed to having a problem - and so too, privately, did Dell at the time. But that was before it began selling millions of machines which had a consistent problem: the capacitors weren&apos;t up to scratch. Because according to the NYT story, the problem that kept cropping up with those machines was, indeed, the capacitors. &quot;The problems affecting the Dell computers stemmed from an industrywide encounter with bad capacitors produced by Asian PC component suppliers. Capacitors are found on computer motherboards, playing a crucial role in the flow of current across the hardware. They are not meant to pop and leak fluid, but that is exactly what was happening earlier this decade, causing computers made by Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Apple and others to break.&quot; Passive Component Industry Magazine (passive components are things like capacitors and resistors) wrote about this in September 2002, though it didn&apos;t know then quite how bad things would get. As Dell&apos;s experience showed, it could get very bad indeed. Back in 2003, Dennis Zogbi, president of Paumanok Publications, an expert on the market for passive components, told me that the problem is that &quot;People want Western quality at Chinese prices,&quot; he said. &quot;Well, you can&apos;t have both.&quot; The story continued well after that, though, with sites such as Badcaps staying on the back of manufacturers including Apple which had had the faulty components. Wikipedia refers to the &quot;capacitor plague&quot; - and though it does seem to have gone into remittance now, Chris Passalacqua, owner of Badcaps, suggests, &quot;They didn&apos;t discover this until it was too late and they had manufactured and distributed literally MILLIONS of these flawed capacitors. However, it&apos;s been going on way too long to simply blame on an industrial espionage boo-boo in my humble opinion, as this problem is still extremely common, and hasn&apos;t slowed down. Personally, I think it all boils down to shoddy components that are manufactured by shoddy component makers.&quot; And that&apos;s where we circle back to Dell&apos;s problems. The NYT said that &quot;The documents chronicling the failure of the PCs also help explain the decline of one of America&apos;s most celebrated and admired companies. Perhaps more than any other company, Dell fought to lower the price of computers.&quot; And that&apos;s certainly true: for years, Dell led because it could undercut rivals, and kept pushing the price down. But price and quality control are always in conflict - and in the end that seems to have done for Dell. While other companies had the capacitor problem too, they didn&apos;t suffer it as long as Dell appears to have. So it was partly something Dell couldn&apos;t have expected to have control over, namely the electrolyte formula in the capacitors in the motherboards and/or power supplies - but also partly something Dell could have acted on, which was the repeated failure of those capacitors.

The deal promises short-term trade advantages for Taiwan. But there are fears that, in the longer term, it may ensnare the self-ruled island in China&apos;s smothering embrace \u2013 and further tip the east Asian balance of power away from the US and its regional allies. Ma Ying-jeou, Taiwan&apos;s president and leader of the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT), strongly backed the pact \u2013 known as the economic co-operation framework agreement \u2013 as part of his policy of improved ties with the mainland. Beijing views Taiwan as a &quot;renegade province&quot;. But since Ma&apos;s election in 2008, cross-strait links and tourism have boomed. Trade with China, Taiwan&apos;s largest export market, grew by almost 70% in the first four months of 2010. The initial &quot;early harvest&quot; agreement cutting tariffs on about 800 items does not cover many of Taiwan&apos;s hi-tech and plastics exports. Analysts predict China&apos;s insistence on protecting its own, less competitive manufacturers in these areas could stymie follow-on negotiations, leaving Taiwan at a disadvantage. But the deal is expected to help level the playing field after China implemented a free-trade deal with the 10-member Association of South-east Asian Nations. Optimists suggest it could also lead to a reduction in military tensions, although there is as yet no sign that China will withdraw its 1,400 missiles aimed at the island. Critics, including former president Lee Teng-hui, say an influx of cheap Chinese goods could hit Taiwanese jobs, undermine local industries and inextricably lock Taiwan into a &quot;one China&quot; market. Ominously, they say, the pact was modelled on the China-Hong Kong &quot;closer economic partnership arrangement&quot;, in which the former British colony was designated a &quot;territory&quot; of China. Pro-independence Taiwanese, roughly one-third of the population, see all this as a Beijing plot for eventual annexation. &quot;This agreement is not about free trade, it is about political control,&quot; said Bob Yang of the US-based Formosan Association for Public Affairs. &quot;[It] undermines Taiwan&apos;s sovereignty and the ability of Taiwanese to determine their own future \u2026 The net effect will be to push Taiwan closer to a still repressive China at the expense of freedom and democracy.&quot; Taiwan&apos;s main opposition parties strongly agree. Tens of thousands of protesters rallied at weekend demonstrations in Taipei. Outrage was also expressed at the blocking of a national referendum on the deal. A new referendum proposal has now been tabled. Whatever the outcome, the opposition is vowing Ma&apos;s KMT will pay a high price in local elections this autumn and in the 2012 presidential poll. The Taiwanese predilection for the status quo, after 60 years of uneasy but largely peaceful co-existence with the island&apos;s giant neighbour, is also evident amid the uproar. &quot;Depending on how one looks at it, today could either be the beginning of a new era of trade in the Taiwan strait or a day of infamy for Taiwan as an independent country,&quot; the Taipei Times said in an editorial. &quot;Many Taiwanese who voted for Ma did so because they believed he was the right man to revive the economy and improve strained relations with key allies. Never did they think he would propel the nation into a sea of uncertainty by adopting hurried and undemocratic means to shove paradigm-changing cross-strait agreements down people&apos;s throats,&quot; the paper said. Ma&apos;s presidency has improved relations with the US as well as China. The Beijing-baiting, pro-independence views of his Democratic Progressive party predecessor, Chen Shui-bian, alarmed the Bush administration, given that the US guarantees Taiwan&apos;s security. But those in Washington suspicious of China&apos;s growing reach may worry now that Ma is over-reaching \u2013 that Taiwan, like other countries in the region, is wandering unwittingly into the spider&apos;s web. Recent leadership changes in Japan and Australia, key US allies, have left plans for multilateral, regional political, economic and security structures in even greater flux than before. China, meanwhile, is steadily cutting Taiwan-style bilateral deals elsewhere, extending its influence and leverage, and pursuing what looks like a sort of self-serving neighbourhood-watch policy. The latest example: its objections to a planned joint military exercise in the Yellow Sea by the US and South Korea following North Korea&apos;s torpedoing in March of a South Korean naval vessel. China has done nothing to punish its North Korean ally. But following the US move, it announced a six-day, live ammunition military exercise in the adjoining East China Sea. The foreign ministry in Beijing says there is no connection between the two \u2013 but if warships and planes cross paths, there certainly could be."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/30/european-loan-refinancing-stock-markets-jittery", "publicationDate": "2010-06-30T08:16:00Z", "tags": ["Market turmoil", "European Central Bank", "European banks", "Business", "World news"], "sentences": ["Japan&apos;s Nikkei ended the day nearly 2% down at 9382.64 while Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng dropped 0.6% to 20,129.30 and the Taiwan stock market finished 1.3% lower at 7329.37."], "title": "Stock markets anxiously await European loan results", "article": "Stock markets remained jittery today amid fresh fears over the global economic recovery and ahead of a crucial repayment by European banks of a \u20ac442bn (\u00a3362bn) European Central Bank loan.

If it turns out that banks need to borrow more than \u20ac300bn, it will be taken as a sign that liquidity has once against dried up and that banks are refusing to lend to each other in a potential re-run of the 2008 banking crisis. The rates at which banks lend to each other have already risen to their highest levels in 10 months ahead of the ECB refinancing amid concerns that some banks would find it difficult to function without the support of the central bank. &quot;In the current climate to order the repayment of last year&apos;s one-year loan of \u20ac442bn [today], the ECB was taking a real chance, particularly as wholesale money markets are moribund,&quot; said David Buik at BGC Partners.

As a rash of new research has shown, such controls are legitimate tools to prevent and mitigate financial crises.  Yet if the pending South Korea-US free trade agreement that the US just agreed to expedite at the G20 meetings had been ratified by now, South Korea&apos;s actions would be deemed illegal.  As the Obama administration works to put Bush-era trade policy behind and forge a &quot;21st century trade policy&quot; it should fix this flaw that could be fatal to South Korea&apos;s financial stability. Like many other emerging markets, South Korea experienced highly volatile levels of capital both leading up to and in the wake of the global financial crisis. The most recent bout of capital inflows \u2013 that pushed up the value of the won \u2013 was largely due to the carry trade given the extremely low interest rates in the US and beyond. However, as the European debt crisis has caused a &quot;flight to safety&quot; where capital is again flocking to the US, the won has been pushed downward.  Starting today, South Korea will impose controls on capital to curtail on the amount of currency forward and derivatives trading that financial institutions can engage in. By putting caps on such leveraging, these measures should tame speculation on the currency and reduce volatility.  These policies are put in place after the nation already lowered interest rates to 2% so as to not attract speculative inflows. In addition to taming volatility then, the Economist adds that with &quot;the foreign-exchange limits in place it may be easier for the Bank of Korea to raise interest rates to a more appropriate level given the economy&apos;s rapid growth&quot;. South Korea joins Brazil, Taiwan, Indonesia, Russia, Brazil, and Venezuela on the list of nations that have deployed capital controls in the wake of the crisis. China has recently said that it may follow suit as well. While such moves would have been seen as blasphemous only a decade ago, they have recently been endorsed by the mainstream. Indeed, these measures follow a mountain of economic evidence in academia and by the international financial institutions, most notably the National Bureau of Economic Research in the US, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, and the Asian Development Bank. The IMF study found that those nations that deployed capital controls were among the least hard hit by the crisis.  Under the Bush administration, the US began outlawing capital controls in the investment chapters of its trade and investment treaties. Beginning with its treaty with Chile \u2013 a nation that has almost unanimously been seen as using capital controls effectively, the US barred capital controls in trade deals with Singapore, Peru, Central America, and Morocco. Such moves were highly controversial \u2013 then US trade representative Robert Zoellick had to go to Chile and personally grace the Chileans over this very issue in order to ink the deal. The pending treaty with South Korea was also negotiated by the Bush administration and remains marred in controversy on both sides of the Pacific. Like the other Bush deals, the South Korean deal shuns capital controls. Though it does provide cover for some of South Korea&apos;s prudential regulations, recent legal analyses suggest that many of the provisions would still be deemed illegal under the US treaty. The US treatment of capital controls is outdated, out of touch with contemporary economic analysis, and out of step with the treaties of its trading partners. Even Robert Zoellick (now president of the World Bank) has now cautiously lent support. On 16 June Zoellick had this to say about controls in Asia: &quot;In a time of policy turmoil like this, people are going to be experimenting with different things&quot;, and &quot;it&apos;s not a silver bullet but it doesn&apos;t surprise me that people are trying them and they may help at the margin&quot;. In terms of being out of step with the treaties of other major capital exporters, in a recent report for the United Nations, I find that almost every other multilateral, regional, or bilateral treaty either fully grants nations to deploy capital controls or at least provides a safeguard mechanism for times like these.  The Obama administration has pledged to do better and create 21st century trade agreements that are more in touch with today&apos;s realities. If the new plan doesn&apos;t give nations the room to manoeuver to prevent and mitigate financial crises it will stay stuck in the Bush era."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jul/01/emissions-recession", "publicationDate": "2010-07-01T15:02:47Z", "tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Pollution", "Recession", "Environment", "Business", "World news"], "sentences": ["Emissions rose in Iran, Indonesia and South Korea but fell in Brazil, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Taiwan."], "title": "Global carbon emissions steady for first time since 1992", "article": "Greenhouse gas emissions from rich countries fell a record 7% in 2009 because of the recession, but the cut was entirely nullified by steep increases from fast-growing China and India, according to one of Europe&apos;s leading scientific research groups. Overall, this meant annual global climate emissions remained steady for the first time since 1992, says the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency which drew on energy-use data from the US government, the EU, BP energy data, the cement industry, and elsewhere. But the Dutch government-funded agency, which in 2007 was the first to correctly identify that China had overtaken the US as the world&apos;s greatest greenhouse gas polluter, warned that the figures did not mean that rich countries had cleaned up their act. &quot;A large part of production capacity has been suspended, but this could be re-employed as soon as the economy improves. It is likely that a recovering economy would cause emission levels in industrialised countries to go up. Nevertheless, the economic downturn has meant that these countries can meet their reduction obligations with more ease,&quot; said NEAA spokeswoman Anneke Oosterhuis. &quot;Another consequence of this downturn is that some industrialised countries may need to purchase fewer emission rights from reduction projects in developing countries, which, in turn, means that there will be less money available for emission reductions in those developing countries,&quot; said Oosterhuis. The figures will come as a relief to the world&apos;s rich countries which \u2013 the US aside \u2013 are legally committed to reducing emissions by a collective 5.2% on 1990 figures by 2012. As it stands, says the Dutch agency, they are now 10% below 1990 levels, well below the Kyoto target level. The research also shows that China and India&apos;s average CO2 emissions per inhabitant are still well below those in industrialised countries. In India the emissions are now 1.4 tonnes per person and in China 6 tonnes, compared with 10 tonnes per person in the Netherlands and 17 tonnes in the United States. China&apos;s 9% growth in emissions came despite its doubling of wind and solar energy capacity for the fifth year in a row. The report highlights the rapid growth in global emissions in the past 40 years. They are now 25% higher than in 2000, almost 40% more than in 1990, and double 1970&apos;s figure of 15.5bn tonnes. The big growth in Chinese and Indian emissions has been relatively recent. China has doubled its emissions in nine years, and India&apos;s have risen by 50% in that time. But the recession has not hit all industrial countries uniformly. Russia (-11%) and Japan (-9%) have contracted their energy use the most, but the US \u2013 which is by far the most profligate power user in the world \u2013 reduced its emissions by nearly 500m tonnes in 2009. Other developing countries changed little in 2009. Emissions rose in Iran, Indonesia and South Korea but fell in Brazil, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Taiwan. 2009 was a good year for renewable energy. Global wind power capacity grew by nearly one third, with nearly one third of all new installations in China. Total solar electricity installed in 2009 was 46% up on 2008. China now leads the world in large-scale hydropower with 19% of global production, well ahead of Brazil and the USA with a 12% share each. The new figures supplement those of the International energy agency (IEA) which predicted in November 2009 that global CO2 emissions would decrease by 2.6% in 2009.

The fall suggests that a stronger pound, coupled with the European debt crisis and signs of a slowdown in China and the rest of Asia, are starting to damage British sales overseas. The Markit/CIPS manufacturing survey, a monthly snapshot of the sector, showed that a measure of export orders plunged to 50.7 last month from 56.7 in May, marking the weakest growth rate since last August. A reading of 50 indicates growth; below 50 signals an overall decline. Overall, manufacturing recorded strong growth in June, down slightly from a 15-year high in May. The headline index edged down to 57.5 from 58. &quot;Looking three to six months ahead, manufacturers don&apos;t have a high degree of confidence,&quot; said Jeegar Kakkad, senior economist at the manufacturers&apos; trade body EEF. &quot;What happened in the last quarter of 2008, when within weeks orders melted away and the market fell off a cliff, made them a lot more cautious than maybe the statistics suggest.&quot; He said that export growth earlier this year had been driven by shipments to Asia and the Middle East, while sales to Europe were also growing but not as fast. Manufacturers are worried about the volatility of the pound against the euro in the wake of the Greek debt crisis. Sterling has strengthened to about \u20ac1.20 from \u20ac1.16 at the time of the election. This is affecting British exports of mechanical parts, such as machine tools and components for machine tools, to Germany. A series of economic figures from China this week has sparked concern that its economic boom is running out of steam. Factory output in China is now falling, while Japan, South Korea, India and Taiwan have seen manufacturing growth slow. UK exports to the US, especially consumer electronics, are also lacklustre, with American consumer confidence still weak, said Kakkad. City economists said the recovery in British industry remained pretty robust \u2013 for now. Some were concerned that the European debt crisis was starting to affect trade. Peter Dixon at Commerzbank said it was having a &quot;significant impact on demand&quot;. Philip Shaw at Investec said: &quot;The headline index has held up very well, it&apos;s not far off a 15-year high and ostensibly implying very strong growth in the manufacturing sector. &quot;But we&apos;re a little bit sceptical. The one obviously negative point is the large decline in the export index, which may be the first indication that the European debt crisis is impacting negatively on trade. It could be a one-off or it could be something more fundamental. We&apos;ll have to gauge next month&apos;s survey and other evidence to determine if this is the case.&quot; Ross Walker at RBS concurred: &quot;The big worry, of course, is still the euro area sovereign debt crisis damaging credit conditions and derailing the recovery.&quot; But he added: &quot;It&apos;s still far too early to expect any of that to show up in the real economy.&quot; On a more positive note, the survey suggested that manufacturers are hiring again. The measure of employment grew at the sharpest rate since February 1995."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/jul/04/expedia-refund-delay", "publicationDate": "2010-07-03T23:05:00Z", "tags": ["Money", "Consumer affairs", "Business", "Travel"], "sentences": ["We booked flights to Taiwan in May 2008 but, when I checked our Expedia account online, I saw there was no confirmed booking."], "title": "Expedia charged for lost booking \u2013 then dragged its heels over refund", "article": "I am a board member for a small arts company.

It said this was correct, as the airline had cancelled the flight because it changed the schedule, which is something that airlines frequently do.

It now says the problem with your original booking was caused by a technical fault between Cathay Pacific&apos;s booking system and the company that processes the bookings.

Fifteen minutes later, she was taking part in industrial action for the first time in her life. &quot;I was worried, but everyone was excited and determined,&quot; recalls the 21-year-old migrant worker at the Denso car parts plant in China&apos;s southern province of Guangdong. &quot;We started our shift at the normal time, but instead of working we just walked around and around the workshop for eight hours. The managers asked us to return to our jobs, but nobody did.&quot; The next day she and the rest of the 1,000-strong workforce repeated the demonstration at the Japanese-owned factory, which makes parts for Toyota and Honda. This time, the corporate union begged them to go back to work. Again they refused. There was no chanting, no speeches, no violence. When the workers got tired, they sat down and chatted for a few minutes. Then they got up and carried on walking until the end of the shift, marked their time cards and went home. Industrial action does not get much lower key than this, nor does it get much more significant. The Denso strike was reported across the world because it took place on the frontline between global labour and global capital: workers in the workshop of the world had downed tools \u2013 and won. For almost three decades, the world&apos;s biggest corporations have outsourced an increasing share of their manufacturing operations to China, where they can benefit from cheap labour and lax regulation. In rich nations this has helped to keep consumer prices low and corporate profits high. In China it has meant workers having to endure a worsening environment, tough conditions and wage rises that have failed to keep pace with economic growth. But Zhang (not her real name) was part of a recent wave of strikes to have hit foreign companies, prompting speculation of a readjustment. In the past two months workers have walked off production lines at three Honda plants, a Toyota supplier, a Hyundai factory in Beijing, a Taiwanese rubber products manufacturer in Shanghai and a Carlsberg brewery in Chongqing. The latest action, last week, was at a Japanese electronics firm, Tianjin Mitsumi, where workers crippled output with a sit-in, complaining they were being asked to work extra hours for no extra pay. In almost every case the strikers have won at least a partial victory. Zhang and her colleagues at Denso went back to work last week after their Japanese bosses promised a rise in the monthly basic salary from 1,300 yuan (\u00a3125) to 1,700 yuan. In addition, they will get a bonus increase of 400 yuan per month. Such successes have created a new cast of heroes for the global labour movement. Business analysts are warning that consumer prices might rise if the era of cheap Chinese goods is over. The ruling Communist party \u2013 which has long since cast aside its revolutionary Marxist origins \u2013 faces a conundrum. Not wanting to stir up a Solidarity-like opposition, the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, has publicly called for improved working conditions. The People&apos;s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist party, has hailed a &quot;tipping point&quot; of relations between labour and capital. There are hopes that a newly aspirational class of migrant workers might drive the economy away from cheap labour and production, so that China could finally leave behind its reliance on low-cost, high-polluting manufacturing. Yet, off-stage, the authorities are terrified of instability and a fall in foreign investment. The governor of Guangdong has been called in to brief the politburo. Domestic reporters have been ordered to play down their coverage of the strikes to minimise the risk of copycat actions. Perhaps for this reason, the workers who have won pay rises in Guangdong are far from triumphant about their success. There is none of the assertive militancy that was seen at the Yorkshire collieries in the 1970s or the Gdansk shipyards in the 1980s. Nervous of repercussions and suspicious of potential management spies, many workers play down their actions. &quot;We don&apos;t call it a strike. We just say we stopped work,&quot; said Zhang. &quot;Nobody tells us who is leading the strike, because if everyone knew then the management might find out and punish them,&quot; said another 22-year-old migrant worker. &quot;Nobody told us there was going to be a strike until it happened.&quot; Off the record, workers said there had been a secret meeting the day before the strike started on 21 June. Rather than leave a digital record that could be traced back to their computers or mobile phones, the organisers handed out leaflets stating their demands to the management: an 800-yuan pay rise, the right to choose their own union representatives and a guarantee that nobody would be punished for striking. On the day of the strike, the organisers were so cautious about revealing themselves that the frustrated management encouraged the official union to organise a vote for representatives so that they had someone to negotiate with. It was not so much a Solidarity moment as a stealth movement. The Pearl River delta contains one of the world&apos;s densest clusters of industrial estates. Many factories sit amid palm trees and vegetable fields ringed by broad roads and power lines. Workers&apos; dormitories sit close by, easily identified by the workers&apos; uniforms on the washing lines and the many pairs of trainers left to air by the windows. The new communities are almost identical. The city of Foshan&apos;s &quot;Car Assembly Town&quot; is typical: a few broad low-rise factories, a thicket of six-storey dormitories, an internet cafe, a mobile phone shop, a bank and a small street of food kiosks selling noodles, fried rice, boiled eggs and spicy stew. Off-duty workers with dyed hair, jeans and trainers wander out from their new dormitory, carrying umbrellas in a rainy season squall that sets the palm trees blowing\u00a0wildly. The turnover of workers is spectacularly rapid. Few of the dozen or so employees at Denso in Foshan and Honda Lock in Zhongshan are older than 22. Many are in their teens. Most are women. Waiting in ragged lines for the factory buses to come to pick them up from their dormitories, they look like pupils on their way to school or teens queuing up for a rock concert. It hardly seems a hotbed of class war. &quot;I felt guilty leaving the production line. This has really hurt the company, and what hurts them will hurt us,&quot; was a typical response from one young worker. But they say rent, food and other living costs have risen faster than wages. After seeing Taiwan&apos;s Foxconn electronics group raise salaries by more than 60%, they pushed for similar benefits. The way they went about it suggests changes may be afoot, albeit slowly. Almost all of the employees at the affected firms in Guangdong attended vocational schools, meaning they had a relatively high level of education compared with the average in Guangdong. During the Honda Lock dispute, they hired a legal consultant, Chang Kai, a lecturer at Renmin University, to help them with negotiations. Thanks to school networks, mobile phones and internet bulletin boards, they are far better organised than the previous generation of migrant workers. Their expectations are also very different. While their parents were willing to &quot;eat bitterness&quot; so they could send money to their desperately poor rural families, many of today&apos;s young workers spend the bulk of their incomes on clothes and phones for themselves. Demographics are on the side of labour. A bulge in the working-age population has started to thin, which is changing the balance between supply and demand. In recent years the flood of new migrants into Guangdong has slowed. According to labour rights campaigners, this is putting upward pressure on salaries. &quot;Labour shortages only existed because companies refused to offer decent wages. As soon as a halfway decent salary and reasonable benefits were offered, recruiters had no problem finding new hires,&quot; wrote Geoff Crothall in a blog for China Labour Bulletin. Many workers are asking for independent collective representation. Unions in China are usually funded by companies, staffed by management and answerable to the Communist party. During an earlier strike at the Honda plant in Zhongshan, union representatives fought workers, injuring two of them. &quot;The union is basically useless,&quot; said Zhou, one of the workers who had been on the strike. &quot;It was wrong of them to beat us.&quot; Given this background, labour activists predict more unrest. &quot;I think there will be more and more strikes. Workers have started to be concerned about their rights as well as their incomes. They have begun to realise that their economic poverty is due to their political poverty,&quot; said Liu Kaiming at the Institute of Contemporary Observation. Employers still have the upper hand in many firms. Many locals believe Japanese companies have been targeted because they treat their workers better than most factories in Guangdong. Local academics and journalists say the pay and conditions at Honda and Toyota are better than average in the province. &quot;I don&apos;t know why the Honda workers went on strike, because their salaries and conditions are better than ours,&quot; said Chen Jian, a 24-year-old employee of the Yongtai Plastic factory, which is only a few miles from the Japanese firm. &quot;We are not satisfied but we will not go on strike. Some workers tried that last year and they were all fired. That is normal.&quot; Additional reporting by Cui Zheng"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/05/1", "publicationDate": "2010-07-05T08:01:04Z", "tags": ["Media"], "sentences": ["MediaGuardian, P6 The Independent Taiwan&apos;s Apple Daily spoofs big news with &apos;maybe journalism&apos;."], "title": "Today's media stories from the papers", "article": "Top stories on MediaGuardian.co.uk     Sir Michael Lyons, BBC Trust chairman.

But for many connoisseurs and concert performers, the pinnacle is the work of a craftsman from Cremona in Italy known as Guarneri del Ges\u00f9. One of the last violins to be created by the master, the Vieuxtemps Guarneri, made in 1741 three years before his death. Now it has been put up for sale in Chicago. If the violin achieves the asking price of $18m (\u00a312m), it would be by a wide margin the most expensive musical instrument on Earth. Dubbed the Mona Lisa of violins, it has been played in concert halls around the world by some of the greatest virtuosi of its 269-year existence. It is named after Henri Vieuxtemps, a 19th-century musician who composed solo pieces for violin which he performed using the instrument. More recently, it has passed through the hands of Yehudi Menuhin, Itzhak Perlman and Pinchas Zukerman. The instrument is owned by a retired British financier and music philanthropist, Ian Stoutzker, who bought it from Sir Isaac Wolfson, founder of Wolfson College, Oxford. It is being sold through one of the world&apos;s leading traders in rare violins, Bein &amp; Fushi of Chicago. Geoffrey Fushi said the instrument was one of the most unusual of Guarneri&apos;s output. It is larger than most, with enormous projection. &quot;I believe it is a living entity, a living being,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;Musicians say the same thing \u2013 that the instrument dictates to them how they play the music.&quot; Philippe Quint, a soloist, has performed on the Vieuxtemps several times with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. &quot;This instrument has the most unbelievable power, not just in loudness but in sound quality. It has a huge palate of colours that allow you to express a wider range of emotions.&quot; For years lovers of the violin have obsessed over the Vieuxtemps. In 1891 the London trader Arthur Hill, who was selling it, wrote in his diary: &quot;What a pity we are not rich enough to keep the violin ourselves as its tone and other merits are perfect.&quot; It is a favourite parlour game of violin aficionados to compare the creations of Antonio Stradivari with his younger rival, Guarneri. Stradivari lived to 93 and about 640 of his violins survive. Bartolomeo Giuseppe Guarneri, to give his proper name, by contrast, died in 1744 at 46, and only about 140 survive. Fushi said the consensus was that &quot;a Guarneri is like a rich chocolate, while a Strad is like strawberry or vanilla ice cream. The Guarneri is often deeper, darker in sound.&quot; Professor David Schoenbaum, of the University of Iowa, who is writing a book on the social history of the violin, said it was almost 100 years after Guarneri&apos;s death before his genius was recognised. In 1830 Niccol\u00f2 Paganini took the Cannone Guarneri to Paris where he astonished audiences with its richness and power. That violin is now regarded as a national treasure and kept in a museum in Genoa. Bein &amp; Fushi&apos;s sales price has raised eyebrows in the historic instrument market. The previous record price was almost half: last October another Guarneri, the Kochanski, sold for $10m. Most observers expect the Vieuxtemps to go to a museum or hedge fund or other institutional collector, as the days in which private individuals and players could afford any Guarneri, let alone a prime specimen, are long since past. Fushi said he had received expressions of interest from all over the world. One of the only collection of violins still in private hands is that of David Fulton, a retired Microsoft magnate, in Seattle but, as in fine art, the money is increasingly coming from the east. The biggest known collections are now at the Chi Mei Museum in Tainan, Taiwan and the Japan Foundation in Tokyo, both of which are potential resting places for the Vieuxtemps Guarneri. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 and 7 July 2010 to make clear in headlines that the Viextemps Guarneri has not yet become the most expensive instrument, and that (contrary to a heading) it is for sale not auction The original also located Chi Mei Museum in Taipei and referred to the soloist Peter Quint. These have been corrected."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/10/all-about-bike-metier-review", "publicationDate": "2010-07-09T23:05:15Z", "tags": ["Sport and leisure", "Books", "Culture", "Cycling"], "sentences": ["The rest was a tale of fat tyres, and fat bank accounts in Taiwan, where most of the world&apos;s bikes are made."], "title": "It's All About the Bike  by Robert Penn | Book review", "article": "My first bike was a Hetchins. For most people that has no resonance, but there are those who understand. It wasn&apos;t just a bike. It was handed down from my father, and it was made by one of a legion of small-scale, artisanal cycle builders who welded up frames in the back of a shop and sold them out the front. It was made to last, and it did. But more than that, it was made to be completely distinctive: slender tubes, joined by lugwork tooled into intricate, gold-plated filigree. Each bike type had a Latin name: &quot;Nulli Secundus&quot;, &quot;Magnum Bonum&quot;. It was a work of art and craftsmanship. Rob Penn&apos;s quest to build the perfect cycle, It&apos;s All About the Bike, takes a brief spin past Hetchins, but does so to make a valid point: small-scale cycle frame builders are now as endangered as trug and clog makers. That&apos;s down to our acceptance of built-in obsolescence, and our perception that what is mass-produced must be cheaper. But frames like a Hetchins \u2013 and the Brian Rourke that Penn opts for \u2013 last half a century, and as he points out, they can be repaired anywhere, by someone with a blowtorch and welding rod. Cyclists pore over the catalogues, websites and magazines known as &quot;bike porn&quot;, but Penn&apos;s book is the cycling equivalent of Ana\u00efs Nin&apos;s Delta of Venus. Or it could be seen as a stretched version of the tale that all cyclists tell when the credit card statements arrive: no matter how shiny and costly the item of bike bling, there is a back story, usually a good one. Artfully, Penn turns his quest for new hardware \u2013 an activity most of us indulge in furtively on the internet \u2013 into a worldwide spin around cycling and its culture. So a trip to a wheel builder deep in cycling&apos;s Californian hippy subculture leads him seamlessly to the birth of the mountain bike, conceived accidentally by a little group in Marin County who adapted city bikes to race down an insanely steep mountain fire trail. The course was nicknamed Repack, because each run would burn out their primitive brakes, meaning they had to be repacked with grease. The rest was a tale of fat tyres, and fat bank accounts in Taiwan, where most of the world&apos;s bikes are made. That is not a new story, but it&apos;s worth the retelling. So too is the diversion around makers of Italian gadgets such as the flamboyant artists of Cinelli, makers of mint-flavoured feeding bottles (&quot;smells better than plastic, yes?&quot;). And there is a timely excursion around the lost world of the British cycle industry, born in the West Midlands, once the home of the largest concentration of bike and component makers in the world, now down to one company, Brooks, manufacturer of the legendary B17 saddle, first made in 1896 and possibly the oldest extant cycle component. If Penn sings a paean to bike bits, Michael Barry&apos;s Le M\u00e9tier \u2013 &quot;the profession&quot; \u2013 (200pp, Rouleur, \u00a335) hymns a different kind of devotion. Barry, a Canadian pro of long standing, is a domestique, and is spending his July as wingman to the British Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins in Team Sky. The domestique concept is unique to cycling: he is the worker who trains and prepares every bit as meticulously and passionately as his leader, but whose role is to be a servant, not a winner. Barry will dedicate 20 days this July to Wiggins, shielding him from the wind, towing him back to the field if he punctures, pushing him if he wants to urinate while on the move. Briefly \u2013 for this is a book of relatively few words \u2013 Barry sprints through team politics, doping, pen-portraits of stars such as Mark Cavendish, and explains the rhythms of the cycling year. Professional cycling amounts to far more than the Tour de France \u2013 it includes the Belgian one-dayer where he has what seems like a career-ending fall, and the secondary American race where he lands a rare win when allowed to race for himself. As a profession it is all-consuming, with rare moments of respite. The physical effort and the battle with the elements \u2013 the heat of July, the winter rain \u2013 are a 12-month affair. A shot of a bus stop in Catalonia has this caption from photographer Camille J McMillan: &quot;I sheltered for a while, shattered, freezing cold and wet. Michael [and training partners] David and Dan battled on. It was a hard slog getting back to them. I was on a Vespa.&quot; It&apos;s not a cheap read, but in that Le M\u00e9tier is the equivalent of a Hetchins it will last, and it is well done. Integrated books about the nature, rather than the history, of professional cycling are rare, and much thought has gone into this one. McMillan&apos;s pictures are accompanied by ephemera such as race numbers, the profiles of stages on the tiny cards handed out to the riders for their reference during races, and \u2013 strictly for the cycling nerds \u2013 a few of Barry&apos;s power-cum-heartrate graphs for races and training rides. These are the stuff of pro cycling life, and so too is one picture in particular: dead-eyed cyclists finding their rooms in a lightless corridor in an anonymous hotel after a stage in the Tour of the Basque country.

Actually, that&apos;s not quite true. Apple designs beautiful kit, but the stuff is made by Foxconn, a huge oriental company. That&apos;s why, on the back of my iPad, it says: &quot;Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China.&quot; And therein lie a number of tales. The standard narrative is the ironic one about rich westerners with more money than sense enjoying luxury gadgets manufactured by poorly paid Chinese workers under commercial security so paranoid that it has allegedly led to suicides. But there are other narratives which receive less attention. The one that concerns me just now is what all this &quot;designed in California, made somewhere else&quot; syndrome means for us. This thought was prompted by a recent broadside from Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel, the world&apos;s leading chip-maker. In the real world, Mr Grove may not be exactly a household name, but in the computing business nobody sleeps at the back when he&apos;s talking. He&apos;s famous for the mantra: &quot;Only the paranoid survive&quot;, which summed up his attitude to competition when he ran Intel. But as well as being fanatically competitive, he&apos;s also far-sighted and perceptive. In 1999, for example, he became briefly notorious for predicting that &quot;in five years&apos; time, companies that aren&apos;t internet companies won&apos;t be companies at all&quot;. Grove was widely ridiculed for this statement. Was he saying, critics inquired sarcastically, that every fast-food joint and grocer would have to be into e-commerce by 2004? Not at all: what he meant was that the internet would become an everyday utility like electricity, something that every company uses, but very few generate, and none can do without. And he was right. In an essay entitled &quot;How to Make an American Job Before It&apos;s Too Late&quot;, Grove pointed out that whereas Apple has 25,000 employees in the US, Foxconn has 250,000 in southern China alone. &quot;The company,&quot; he points out, &quot;has grown at an astounding rate, first in Taiwan and later in China. Its revenue last year was $62bn, larger than Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Dell Inc or Intel. Foxconn employs more than 800,000 people, more than the combined worldwide head count of Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard Co, Intel and Sony Corp.&quot; Grove cited these figures to attack what he regards as a pernicious mindset that now afflicts government policymakers in most western countries \u2013 &quot;Our own misplaced faith in the power of start-ups to create US jobs. Americans love the idea of the guys in the garage inventing something that changes the world. New York Times columnist Thomas L Friedman recently encapsulated this view in a piece called &apos;Start-Ups, Not Bailouts&apos;. His argument: let tired old companies that do commodity manufacturing die if they have to. If Washington really wants to create jobs, he wrote, it should back start-ups.&quot; Grove thinks this is baloney and he&apos;s right. Start-ups are wonderful but \u2013 at least in technology \u2013 they generally don&apos;t create jobs on the scale that western economies need. What really matters is what comes after that eureka moment in the garage, as the new idea goes from prototype to mass production. &quot;This is the phase,&quot; Grove writes, &quot;where companies scale up. They work out design details, figure out how to make things affordably, build factories and hire people by the thousands. Scaling is hard work but necessary to make innovation matter.&quot; At the moment, any successful start-up engaged in scaling up will immediately plan to outsource production to China or Taiwan, because it&apos;s the economically rational thing to do. As a result, most of the jobs created by the new idea will not be in the US (or Britain) but somewhere in the far east. &quot;No problem,&quot; say the venture capitalists who are funding the process. &quot;The intellectual property \u2013 and the value \u2013 stay here while the grunt-work of mass production goes elsewhere.&quot; All of which is true. But consider the outcome: the new company has a smallish number of highly qualified (and well-paid) workers in its home base, oodles of incoming revenue (eventually) and a great deal of government and media approval. But the only other jobs it creates will be in low-paid service occupations \u2013 cleaning, warehousing, shipping and the like. And so the hollowing out of western economies continues, even as they continue to be powerhouses of innovation and technological ingenuity. Every time you buy the latest gizmo \u2013 smartphone, tablet, flat-screen TV, broadband router, camera \u2013 you&apos;re an unwitting participant in it. And it&apos;s all the product of our fanatical commitment to economic rationality. The Greeks used to say that those whom the gods wished to destroy, they first made mad. Now it seems that they just make them rational."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/22/serbia-battle-for-kosovo", "publicationDate": "2010-07-22T16:30:38Z", "tags": ["Kosovo", "Serbia", "Russia", "United Nations", "World news", "Law", "Europe"], "sentences": ["Separatists, secessionists and splittists from Taiwan, Xinjiang and Somaliland to Sri Lanka, Georgia and the West Country will welcome today&apos;s precedent-setting legal opinion from the UN&apos;s international court of justice effectively upholding Kosovo&apos;s unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia."], "title": "The end of the battle for Kosovo | Simon Tisdall", "article": "Separatists, secessionists and splittists from Taiwan, Xinjiang and Somaliland to Sri Lanka, Georgia and the West Country will welcome today&apos;s precedent-setting legal opinion from the UN&apos;s international court of justice effectively upholding Kosovo&apos;s unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia. With hindsight it seems clear the 1990 reunification of Germany ran contrary to modern history&apos;s tide, marking a sort of last stand for the old 19th-century model of the unitary nation state. Since the Berlin wall came down and the Soviet Union disintegrated two years later, things everywhere have been falling apart. Fractious minority movements seeking recognition, autonomous rights, or outright independence since the cold war&apos;s end loosened the global geostrategic straitjacket have become commonplace across Europe. Spain frets about its Basques and Catalans, the unifying impact of its World Cup success notwithstanding. Italy&apos;s Germans often give cause for concern. The United Kingdom may prospectively be obliged to change its name, should breakaway Scottish and Welsh nationalist parties have their way. Some speak passionately of independence for the ancient kingdom of Kernow, otherwise known as Cornwall. And if it&apos;s Kernow redux, then why not Northumbria, Mercia, and Wessex, too? In Wiltshire they await a new Arthur. The accelerating trend towards the assertion of minority national, basically tribal rights, usually defined in terms of sovereign territory, delineated borders, ethnicity, language and history, appears global in nature. Vuk Jeremic, Serbia&apos;s foreign minister, who led opposition to Kosovo&apos;s UDI, suggested the fracturing of the nation state paradigm, like cracks in glass plate, could spread widely and do great damage. Speaking before Kosovo&apos;s formal 2008 break with Serbia, Jeremic looked beyond the Balkans to countries such as Sudan, a country that is likely to break in half this winter. In Africa, he said, &quot;there are about 50 Kosovos waiting to happen&quot;. International acceptance of Kosovo&apos;s unilateral act &quot;would be a very dangerous signal, a signal that there are no rules. Serbia wants to play by the rules. You just can&apos;t come along and say they don&apos;t matter any more.&quot; Boris Tadic, Serbia&apos;s president, revisited this argument this week. A ruling favouring Kosovo &quot;would destabilise many regions of the world&quot;, he said. Now that Serbia&apos;s worst fears have been realised, it remains to be seen whether such dire predictions prove accurate. More prosaically, the world court&apos;s delayed advisory opinion hardly came as a surprise and must now be managed politically if new strife, most possibly in ethnically mixed northern Kosovo, is to be avoided. In the end the ruling was more a matter of hard-headed realpolitik than carefully appraised international law. The US, Kosovo&apos;s principal sponsor, was adamant all along the court&apos;s opinion would have little practical impact, a view echoed by Tony Blair, Kosovo&apos;s self-styled liberator, during a visit this week. Joe Biden, the US vice-president, also emphasised that independence was a done deal while affording Kosovan prime minister Hashim Thaci the Washington red carpet treatment on Wednesday. Independence was not primarily a matter of law, a White House spokesman said. &quot;We do not believe that declarations of independence are legal acts whose legality is affirmed or denied by this international court. They are political facts that have to be established through political realities.&quot; The US has its own experience in this department. In 1776, American independence came at the muzzle of a musket, not in the form of a lawsuit against George III. Despite their protestations, and they will be long and angry, Serbia and its main backer, Russia, half expected this outcome. Their best course now may be to turn it to their maximum advantage rather than play a spoiler&apos;s game at the UN general assembly (which must endorse the ruling). One obvious approach is to accept the EU&apos;s proposed technical talks on creating a pragmatic modus vivendi between Belgrade and Pristina while seeking support, as a tacit quid pro quo, for a renewed effort to advance Serbia&apos;s EU membership bid. The US may think it&apos;s got ahead. But Russia could win both ways, not least in terms of its Georgia intervention. The court&apos;s failure to oppose Kosovo&apos;s secession &quot;would automatically weaken the west&apos;s case against the recognition of [the independence of] Abkhazia and South Ossetia by Russia,&quot; said Petr Iskenderov of the Russian Academy of Science in International Affairs magazine. Moscow could also use the decision to push for an &quot;overhaul&quot; of the international community&apos;s approach to frozen disputes in the Balkan and Caspian regions that affect its interests, such as that between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the breakaway enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, he said. Serbia now faces the prospect of increased international recognition of Kosovo, the country&apos;s prospective membership of the UN, and the permanent loss of a territory its regards as a defining part of its sovereignty and history. At the same time, the gates to Europe swing open. It is a bitter pill to swallow. It could trigger domestic political upheavals. But when the dust settles, common sense and self-interest may dictate acceptance of the outcome. Like the Battle of Kosovo Field in 1389 that was so critical to Serbia&apos;s identity, the modern day battle for Kosovo is lost."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/23/kosovo-independence-serbia", "publicationDate": "2010-07-22T23:05:45Z", "tags": ["Kosovo", "Serbia", "Law", "World news", "Europe"], "sentences": ["China and Taiwan today and the Federal Republic of Germany and the GDR before reunification are examples of hostile states which established a modus vivendi."], "title": "Kosovo: A chip off the old bloc | Editorial", "article": "The ruling of the international court of justice yesterday that Kosovo did not violate international law by declaring its independence from Serbia over two years ago will do nothing to reassure other countries facing separatist disputes. Nor will it prevent territories as far-flung (with cases as diverse) as Northern Cyprus, Somaliland, Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Transnistria from seeking the same recognition. The judgment is non-binding, and the court did not say that Kosovo&apos;s independence was legal \u2013 merely that its declaration of independence was not illegal, which is not the same thing. China and Russia will continue to lead a bloc of countries who refuse to legitimise an act of secession; and in reality very little will change. However, as a precedent, this is not a good one. Other states that have had bits chipped off them, like Georgia or Moldova, would be right to be worried by this, because the practical effect of this ruling is that might is right. If you have America or Russia behind a part of your state that wants to break free, recognition will happen. Legitimacy is bestowed by force. Nor will the decision do anything to calm local tensions, at least in the short term. What all states that are mutually blind to each other need is to establish a working relationship. China and Taiwan today and the Federal Republic of Germany and the GDR before reunification are examples of hostile states which established a modus vivendi. That too is needed between Kosovo and Serbia over the Serb enclave north of the town of Mitrovica, a small area which has frequently erupted into violence. This ruling will reinforce Kosovo&apos;s resistance to any kind of negotiation over Mitrovica North&apos;s status, which Kosovo&apos;s foreign minister Skender Hyseni called inconceivable. Whatever they are called \u2013 negotiations or technical talks \u2013 a special status for this enclave will have to be hammered out if peace is to be restored. Serbia and Russia rejected yesterday&apos;s ruling from the ICJ. The former said it would continue to preserve its territorial integrity, while the latter insisted the decision did not provide a legal basis for independence. However, time has moved on for both countries. An entrenchment of Serbian claims on Kosovo would conflict with its ambitions for EU membership. Belgrade need not recognise Kosovo to do a deal on Mitrovica North in which it would act as a guarantor of the enclave&apos;s autonomy, but its leaders need to summon the political courage to do this. Similarly Russia \u2013 after the global financial crisis and with oil prices depressed \u2013 is no longer as interested as it was in pursuing a policy of divide and rule with western Europe. It has more to gain out of resetting relations with it."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/23/firefighter-motorbikes-liverpool", "publicationDate": "2010-07-23T16:30:42Z", "tags": ["Firefighters", "UK news", "Liverpool"], "sentences": ["Firefighter motorbikes are already used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Denmark."], "title": "Firefighter motorbikes scheme alarms union", "article": "The firefighters&apos; union today expressed concern about the deployment of specially adapted motorbikes to blazes in Liverpool.

Peter Rushton, a spokesman for Merseyside fire and rescue service, said: &quot;The bikes will be used to put out small fires and car fires, not fires that represent a danger to property or people. They can get to an incident pretty quickly, so they can turn back fire engines if it is a secondary fire or a false alarm. &quot;Fire engines carry four or five crew members and rescue equipment, so if there is a serious fire this will mean they are more likely to be available.&quot; The service&apos;s group manager, John McCormack, said: We have no intention of using them to replace fire engines.

The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predicts Britain&apos;s GDP will grow by 1.3% this year, which is slightly more optimistic than the 1.2% forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. But as consumer spending fails to rebound and the government&apos;s austerity plans bite, it expects growth next year to be only 1.7% and 2.2% in 2012, compared with OBR forecasts of 2.3% and 2.8%. The independent thinktank predicts that public sector spending cuts by the new coalition government will subtract from economic growth in every year from 2011 to 2015. The quarterly outlook for the UK is its first in-depth analysis of growth prospects since George Osborne&apos;s emergency budget in late June. After official data last week showed the economy growing almost twice as fast as most economists had expected in the second quarter, NIESR warned the path ahead would still be &quot;bumpy&quot;. While its outlook did not specifically mention the risk of a &quot;double-dip recession&quot; it did say there were risks of growth disappearing in some quarters. For the third quarter it expects growth of 0.1%, followed by 0.3% in the fourth quarter. &quot;We should not rule out the chances of negative quarters,&quot; said NIESR research fellow Simon Kirby. &quot;The plans in the budget will inevitably hold growth back somewhat.&quot; In predictions likely to be welcomed by the government in its bid to rebalance the UK economy away from over-dependence on domestic spending, NIESR is gloomy about the prospects for consumer spending. It forecasts that per capita consumer spending will not return to its pre-recession peak until 2015. The thinktank predicts the world economy will grow by 5% this year. This compares with a dip of 0.6% last year, with a rebound in world trade playing a large role in the recovery. But it forecasts the trade effect will wane in 2011 and domestic demand in major economies will fail to pick up the slack. At the same time many countries will embark in ernest on their fiscal consolidation plans and so growth will ease off to 4.4%, NIESR predicts. Asia will continue to drive the global recovery, with exceptionally strong growth in China, India and Taiwan in particular, NIESR says. It believes China will overtake the US as the world&apos;s largest economy in 2019, a year sooner than previously thought, largely thanks to China suffering relatively little during the global economic crisis. Following its financial crisis earlier this year and the subsequent bailout, Greece remains under significant pressure from &quot;stubbornly high&quot; bond yields, the group warns. It estimates that if yields could fall back relative to German government bonds - also know as Bunds - to a spread last seen in January it would improve Greece&apos;s large deficit by 0.9% of GDP and also significantly boost growth. So far that is not happening, but NIESR senior research fellow Dawn Holland says last week&apos;s European bank stress tests may pave the way for Greek bond yields to now ease off as market confidence returns somewhat. &quot;With any luck we will start to see those Bund spreads coming down over the next few months and that should improve prospects for growth,&quot; she said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/28/plane-crashes-pakistan-karachi-islamabad", "publicationDate": "2010-07-28T12:04:00Z", "tags": ["Plane crashes", "Pakistan", "Air transport"], "sentences": ["25 May 2002: China Airlines Boeing 747 breaks apart in midair en route to Hong Kong and crashes into the Taiwan Strait."], "title": "No survivors as plane crash near Pakistan capital claims 152 lives", "article": "     A domestic passenger flight has crashed near Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, killing all 152 people on board in what is thought to be the country&apos;s deadliest civil aviation accident.

Tseng, 21, who led the tournament since Thursday evening, when she shared the top of the leaderboard with the Australian Hull, had been four shots clear at the start of the day. But bogeys at the 3rd, 8th and 10th holes allowed Hull the chance to hit back. Two birdies on the back nine closed the deficit to one stroke but Hull&apos;s hopes of forcing a play-off ended following a poor third shot on the 18th. After just missing a birdie when a 20-foot putt lipped out on the par-five 17th, Hull was given further encouragement when Tseng&apos;s tee shot at the 18th found the sand. Tseng opted for safety while Hull attacked the green but the Australian overhit her second shot as the ball landed about 25 yards long and in the rough. An excellent approach shot for her\u00a0third put Tseng within six yards of the hole while Hull&apos;s fading hopes for victory evaporated\u00a0as she hit her third shot well short. Tseng tapped in to card a one\u2011over\u2011par 73 and take her majors tally to three, having won the Kraft Nabisco Championship earlier this year and the LPGA Championship in 2008. She becomes the youngest golfer ever to win three LPGA majors. Having appeared totally in control during the first 54 holes, in which she shot 68 in every round and dropped only one shot, she was much more edgy today and tears of relief flowed after she struck the final putt. &quot;I was very nervous, especially the last few holes,&quot; said the world No5, who pockets \u00a3260,000 in winnings. &quot;I was so tired today, there was so much pressure and expectations \u2013 it was an unbelievable day for me. A four-shot lead on this golf course is nothing. She [Hull] really pushed me a lot and it was so close. She was pretty awesome.&quot; With only one top-10 finish in 23 previous majors, it was a day of mixed emotions for Hull. &quot;I am disappointed but there are also a lot of positives to take from this week,&quot; she said. &quot;I never gave up but it&apos;s just a pity I couldn&apos;t make a birdie at one of the three long holes at the end.&quot; Two Koreans, Choi Na-yeon and Kim In\u2011kyung, tied for third place on seven under and two more Koreans, Amy Yang and Seo Hee-kyung, were joined by this year&apos;s LPGA Championship winner, the American Cristie Kerr, in a tie for fifth on six under. Other notable performances included a final-round 66, six under par, by the Korean Park In-bee, who managed four birdies and an eagle to finish in a tie for sixth.

A purchasing managers&apos; index (PMI) from HSBC and analysts Markit revealed a fall to 49.4 from 50.4 in June. Some economists said this was likely to continue into the autumn as the Chinese authorities work to prevent the economy overheating and property prices running out of control. Commodity prices, which had recovered in recent weeks from a 25% fall in May, were expected to decline as demand from Chinese manufacturers fell. A slowdown in other major economies including the US and Japan is also expected to dampen demand for oil, copper and other commodities. A manufacturing index backed by the Chinese government showed the slowest expansion in manufacturing in 17 months in July. The index, released by the statistics bureau and the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, slid to 51.2, the lowest level in 17 months. &quot;There is no need to panic,&quot; said Qu Hongbin, a Hong Kong-based economist at HSBC, repeating his assessment of last month that China is having a &quot;slowdown not a meltdown&quot;. China&apos;s more moderate expansion is still expected to foster full-year growth of 9.5%, up from 9.1% in 2009, although it needs to grow at least 6% to 7% to keep up with population growth. HSBC&apos;s manufacturing survey covers more than 400 companies and is weighted more toward smaller, privately owned business than the government&apos;s PMI, according to the bank. The PMI released by the logistics federation and the Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics covers more than 730 companies. Morgan Stanley economist Wang Qing told Bloomberg that a government campaign to close energy-inefficient businesses is likely to have contributed to a slowdown in heavy industry. A slowdown in growth in South Korea and Taiwan underscored how Beijing&apos;s efforts to curb a property price boom have affected the rest of Asia, where export industries have been driven by Chinese demand.

But Washington&apos;s move was less an acceptance of claims that Kopassus has reformed itself than recognition of Indonesia&apos;s growing strategic importance in the face of China&apos;s inexorable rise. Suciwati Munir, widow of the Indonesian rights activist Munir Said Thalib, whose poisoning in 2004 remains unexplained, warned that Barack Obama was &quot;making a dangerous mistake&quot; if he believed Kopassus had changed its ways. &quot;Members of Kopassus have no fear they will be prosecuted for serious wrongdoing \u2026 This will not change until members who have committed abuses are brought to justice,&quot; she wrote in a Washington Post op-ed headlined &quot;Getting away with murder&quot;. Pentagon chief Robert Gates announced the end of the 11-year ban on contacts during a visit to Jakarta, following reported assurances from Indonesia that convicted abusers had been removed from the unit. &quot;These initial steps will take place within the limits of US law and do not signal any lessening of the importance we place on human rights and accountability,&quot; Gates said. But regional analysts suggest the relaxation may quickly lead to the resumption of full-scale, military-to-military co-operation, including combat training of Indonesian forces (suspended in 1998 during the East Timor crisis) and increased financial aid and weapons sales. Such moves would mirror recently enhanced US security collaboration with other regional countries with questionable human rights records, including Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Laos, as well as with long-standing allies such as Japan, South Korea and Australia. China&apos;s rulers appear to have little doubt what Washington&apos;s security-first approach signifies. Friction over planned US-South Korean naval exercises in the Yellow Sea and US arms sales to Taiwan was exacerbated by secretary of state Hillary Clinton&apos;s surprise announcement last month that the US has a &quot;national interest&quot; in resolving territorial disputes and keeping international sea lanes open in the South China Sea. Beijing had previously declared that pursuing its sovereign rights in various disputes there involving Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and others was a &quot;core interest&quot;, indicating for the first time that its position was non-negotiable, as with Tibet and Taiwan. Reacting to Clinton&apos;s rejection of this stance at a regional summit in Hanoi, foreign minister Yang Jiechi accused the US of ganging up with other countries while state media claimed angrily Washington was trying to &quot;contain&quot; China. Yang even appeared to threaten unpleasant consequences. China, he said, &quot;is a big country and other countries are small countries, and that&apos;s just a fact&quot;. With a population of 240 million living in a vast archipelago of over 17,000 islands, &quot;small&quot; is not an adjective readily applicable to Indonesia. But Yuri Octavian Thamrin, the country&apos;s ambassador to London, agrees that Indonesia&apos;s increasing strategic importance is of growing interest to the two jousting superpowers. &quot;We see the US as one of our closest friends. We admire and respect them,&quot; Yuri said. Relations had improved under Obama, who lived in Indonesia as a child, was personally very popular, and is expected to visit later this year. &quot;Indonesia is at a strategic chokepoint between the Indian and Pacific oceans. 50,000 ships pass through the Malacca Strait each year \u2026 We can be a regional asset for stability, like Egypt in the Middle East,&quot; he said. Co-operation on terrorism, piracy, security and investment between Washington and the world&apos;s most populous Muslim democracy were all improving \u2013 although Jakarta would like to see additional US military aid in recognition of its expanding role, he said. But given the country&apos;s significant economic, institutional and environmental challenges, and its remarkable but still youthful democratic transformation since the end of the Suharto era in 1998, Indonesia was definitely not interested in getting squeezed between China and the US. &quot;Our president [Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono] says our policy is one of &apos;having no enemies and making 1,000 friends&apos;. For us what&apos;s important is promoting national values, institution building, the economy. We would like to see a situation in which the great powers co-operate to enhance regional stability,&quot; Yuri said. The nuances of professional diplomacy aside, it seems Obama is knocking on an open door in Jakarta, non-aligned or not. Gates&apos;s announcement on Kopassus was welcome &quot;but should have happened sooner&quot;, Yuri said; notwithstanding the human rights criticism, a recent survey found 68% of Indonesians believed Kopassus had &quot;more or less reformed&quot; and was no longer a pressing issue. &quot;Civilian-military relations are OK now. People are more concerned now about corruption, terrorism and good governance.&quot; After turbulent decades of &quot;strongman&quot; politics, he said, Indonesia was writing its own success story."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2010/aug/05/pc-for-parents", "publicationDate": "2010-08-05T12:02:00Z", "tags": ["Computing", "Internet", "Technology"], "sentences": ["An early example is the Lenovo ThinkPad X201i, which has just been launched in Taiwan."], "title": "Wanted: a PC to get aging parents online | Ask Jack", "article": "My parents, both in their late 70s, want to get online. I think they&apos;ll only need a browser, ideally with Flash support. Is there some kind of set-top box PC that they could use through their TV that might avoid the worst of trojans/viruses etc? Or is there a better solution? Alastair Young This is a market that a lot of companies have tried to crack since WebTV was launched in 1996 with internet-enabled set-top boxes from Philips and Sony. So far, none of them has been successful. Google plans to make the next attempt with Google TV, and it will support Adobe Flash. Sony has agreed to make Google TV sets while Logitech will make set-top boxes that can be used with existing TV sets. Unfortunately, we don&apos;t yet know when systems will be launched, when they might reach the UK, how well they might work, or how much they will cost. Under the circumstances, there&apos;s no point in waiting. If anybody knows of a television set-top box that allows real internet browsing and is currently available in the UK, please let us know. Of course, there are some very small Windows PCs that can be used with TV sets. The leading examples include the Acer Aspire Revo and the Asus Eee Box, which can be clipped to the back of a TV set. (See my comments on Windows at the end.) However, I really don&apos;t think a TV set is the best choice for web surfing. You need to be close to the screen to read the web and much further away to watch broadcast TV. This problem is being solved by the introduction of WiDi notebooks, where WiDi is a &quot;wireless display&quot;. In other words, the notebook uses Wi-Fi to transmit to a separate TV screen. An early example is the Lenovo ThinkPad X201i, which has just been launched in Taiwan. Apple&apos;s iPad might be an option, but it doesn&apos;t support Abode Flash and it&apos;s very expensive for what you get. This suggests, as an alternative, a similar media tablet running the Google Android operating system \u2026 but you can&apos;t buy one of those either. You could perhaps show your parents one of the larger smartphones running Android 2.2, which supports Flash 10.1. If they really like it, it might be worth waiting until Android tablets appear. There are real advantages to having a proper keyboard, especially for writing emails and playing casual games online, so the obvious alternative is a netbook or a laptop with a larger screen. A portable PC with a 15.6-inch screen will would be easier to read, and you can get one running Windows 7 for about \u00a3300. A MacBook would cost a lot more, but it depends how much you are willing to spend. If Windows sounds too risky, then the  Jolicloud version of Linux looks like a good option; it&apos;s based on Ubuntu Netbook Remix. You could see how your parents might get on with Linux by running Ubuntu or a slimline version of Linux (Puppy, etc) from a USB thumbdrive. There&apos;s also Thinstation. I have not tried it, but its website says: &quot;Thinstation supports a Microsoft Windows-only environment and requires no Unix/Linux knowledge.&quot; Some Windows netbooks and laptops come with thin versions of Linux built in. For example, Asus fits some of its machines with ExpressGate, which is a version of Splashtop. That gets you into a browser in a few seconds without booting Windows, and it also supports Skype. However, I suspect your parents would ultimately prefer to run Windows, mainly because such a lot of online content targets Windows machines. So, of course, do almost all viruses, but there are several ways of dealing with that. Companies typically control what Windows users can do by giving them limited accounts and locking everything down using Group Policies. But it might be better to assume that everything will go wrong and just deal with it. Some cybercafes, schools, public libraries and even a few home users do this by running Microsoft&apos;s free SteadyState 2.5 software. This protects the hard drive and limits what users can do, but it doesn&apos;t matter much, because rebooting the PC returns it to the state it was in before. The drawback is that it only supports Windows XP and Vista, not Windows 7. (Microsoft had other plans for Windows 7, and failed to deliver.) One alternative would be Returnil, which loads a copy of Windows in a &quot;virtual PC&quot;. Again, it doesn&apos;t matter if the user messes it up. When the PC is restarted, the old virtual PC is thrown away and Returnil just loads a new one. There is a Home Free version of Returnil but Home Lux ($39.95) is better. There are also Enterprise versions for business use. Another option is Comodo Time Machine. There have been &quot;roll back&quot; programs for Windows for at least a decade, but this one&apos;s free. And if you do go for Windows, set it up so that you can log on and fix it remotely, or install one of the third-party alternatives."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/06/swaziland-minister-quits-kings-wife", "publicationDate": "2010-08-06T13:24:29Z", "tags": ["Swaziland", "World news", "Africa"], "sentences": ["The British-educated Mswati \u2013 who was on a two-week official visit to Taiwan when the story broke \u2013 is frequently criticised by human rights groups as a dictator who runs the Aids-ravaged country of 1 million people as his personal fiefdom."], "title": "Swaziland minister quits over alleged affair with one of king's wives", "article": "A government minister in Swaziland has resigned amid rumours that he had an affair with one of the 14 wives of King Mswati III. Ndumiso Mamba, the justice minister and childhood friend of Mswati, stepped down as the sex scandal rocked the tiny African kingdom. A pro-democracy group, Swaziland Solidarity Network, alleged last week that Mamba had been having an affair with 23-year-old Inkhosikati LaDube, the 12th wife of the king. It has been claimed that LaDube wore an elaborate disguise so she could enjoy clandestine meetings with Mamba. The queen is said to have dressed in military fatigues to leave the royal palace without arousing suspicion. A palace source was quoted by the South African Press Association as saying: &quot;For many months the inkhosikati (queen) would dress in an army uniform whenever the king was not around. &quot;She allegedly got into her room and changed into her uniform and walked straight to the gate and no one bothered to ask where was this soldier going. In no time a car was there to pick the &apos;officer&apos; up and whisked her to Royal Villas [a luxury hotel] about 10km west of the Lozitha palace.&quot; But Mamba was apparently caught and arrested in a police sting at the hotel, owned by 42-year-old Mswati. He was reportedly detained in a police station, then prison, and faces possible expulsion from the country. The queen was put under house arrest. The affair has caused huge embarrassment to Africa&apos;s last absolute monarchy after failed attempts to prevent it from leaking into the public domain. Newspapers are tightly censored and the Times of Swaziland reported only: &quot;Mamba resigned following certain allegations circulating in the country and internationally.&quot; But the story has been seized on by the press in neighbouring South Africa. Banarbas Sibusiso Dlamini, the Swazi prime minister, said: &quot;There is a story that has gone far which is currently being circulated \u2026 The story touches on the minister of justice and constitutional affairs, Ndumiso Mamba. &quot;Mamba had opted to resign as both senator and minister of justice \u2026 to allow the matter to be considered by the appropriate authorities.&quot; Dlamini did not give any details of the case or accept questions on the subject. LaDube was 16 when she first caught the king&apos;s eye at the annual Reed Dance pageant six years ago. She has borne him three children. The British-educated Mswati \u2013 who was on a two-week official visit to Taiwan when the story broke \u2013 is frequently criticised by human rights groups as a dictator who runs the Aids-ravaged country of 1 million people as his personal fiefdom. Sandwiched between South Africa and Mozambique, Swaziland won independence from Britain in 1968 but has been without a constitution since 1973. Political parties are banned and the king appoints the government."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/08/robert-penn-all-about-the-bike", "publicationDate": "2010-08-07T23:05:15Z", "tags": ["Cycling", "Sport and leisure", "Books", "Culture"], "sentences": ["I did not care where the frame was made (Taiwan) or have any interest in any of the components, beyond being childishly impressed by the fact it had 27 gears (25 of which remain sadly neglected)."], "title": "It's All About the Bike by Robert Penn | Book review", "article": "&quot;Every time you spend money,&quot; wrote American ethicist Anna Lapp\u00e9, &quot;you&apos;re casting a vote for the kind of world you want.&quot; I think about this statement quite regularly, sometimes when I walk\u00a0past Pret a Manger, in search of a less soul-destroying lunchtime sandwich, but most often when I ride to and from work. About a decade ago, when I thought of bicycles as no more than a time-saving mode of transport, I bought a hybrid made by a behemoth American manufacturer. It looked all right, it fitted my budget, I rode it round the block once and took it home. I did not care where the frame was made (Taiwan) or have any interest in any of the components, beyond being childishly impressed by the fact it had 27 gears (25 of which remain sadly neglected). It did not take me long to realise that my \u00a3500 had cast a vote for, if not Nick Griffin, then certainly Robert Kilroy-Silk. The bike was not particularly well made: there were recurring problems with the wheels and, after a few years, the aluminium frame actually snapped (it was replaced, under guarantee, by the behemoth). But mostly, as my interest in cycling increased, I was distressed by the hybrid&apos;s utter lack of personality, its unashamed generic-ness. At the end of each day, my heart sinks slightly when I return to the lamppost and see it has not been stolen. On the evidence of his new book, It&apos;s All About the Bike, Robert Penn is likely to sympathise with my predicament. He has ridden bikes for 36 years and has owned everything from a Raleigh Tomahawk to a bespoke tourer that he cycled for three years and 40,000km round the world in the mid-1990s. He currently has five bikes \u2013 or &quot;steeds&quot; in his argot \u2013 but this book follows his quest to build one dream machine &quot;to grow old with&quot;. As he writes early on: &quot;Anyone who rides a bike regularly and has even the faintest feeling of respect or affection for their own steed will know this hankering \u2013 I want my bike.&quot; Penn, a natural-born enthusiast, starts the process with a tour of Britain&apos;s artisan frame-builders. Considering the battering they must have endured, it is something of a miracle that any of these operations remain. Penn, however, paints a portrait of time-warped perfectionists, drinking endless mugs of tea while using skills and craftsmanship that remain unsurpassed anywhere in the world. But Penn is not simply a nostalgist; what he really rails against is the idea of built-in obsolescence, and the accepted truth that new technologies automatically trump old ones. In the end, he eschews the lightweight dynamism of carbon fibre for a steel frame made by Brian Rourke Cycles in Stoke-on-Trent because it will be strong, easy to repair and just as dependable 30 years from now. From here, Penn&apos;s odyssey takes him around the world to kit out his bike with the perfect components. These are not necessarily the most expensive ones, but let&apos;s just say that he doesn&apos;t nip into Halfords at any stage. Some names will be familiar to enthusiasts (Campagnolo, Cino Cinelli, Brooks), others may not be (wheelman Steve &quot;Gravy&quot; Gravenites of California). It is not exactly a low-carbon exercise, but Penn reminds us that he will make amends by riding his dream creation every day for the next three decades. While It&apos;s All About the Bike lacks an obvious cliffhanger ending, \u2013 the biggest nail-biter is what colour Penn paints the frame \u2013 it is particularly strong on the history of cycling, placing Penn&apos;s bike within the context of the draisines, dandy horses, boneshakers and widow-makers that have gone before.

A number of countries have concluded that when it comes to selling their image and their goods to the British public, there is no more effective way to win hearts and minds than through the stomach. Taiwan has become the latest country to launch a diplomatic drive based around its national cuisine. President Ma Ying-jeou has ordered his envoys to start talking the language of food by launching a \u00a320m &quot;gastro-diplomacy&quot; campaign in the UK and elsewhere. Taiwan&apos;s consulate in London is hoping to make dishes such as &quot;stinky tofu&quot; and oyster omelette the stars of a diplomatic drive to differentiate the country from its giant and sometimes antagonistic neighbour, China, and to end the perception that Taiwan is little more than the mass-production workshop of the world. It is not alone. The Malaysian government will next month transform Trafalgar Square into a street food bazaar as part of a UK campaign fronted by chef Rick Stein. South Korea has pushed its culture through a programme of &quot;Kimchi&quot; diplomacy, particularly in the US. Kimchi refers to Korea&apos;s ubiquitous fermented vegetable pickle, and there has been a boom in Korean fast food trucks in California serving kimchi quesadillas. The ultimate goal for gastro-diplomats is to emulate the success of Thailand&apos;s 2002 &quot;Global Thai&quot; campaign, which increased the number of Thai restaurants around the world, making pad Thai and tom yum just as familiar a shorthand for Thailand as the hamburger is for America. Even North Korea is putting its best food forward: a chain of state-owned &quot;Pyongyang restaurants&quot; has spread to Cambodia, Bangkok, China and Laos, serving dishes such as ice-encrusted noodles and dog-meat soup, while waitresses sing and dance to North Korean songs. &quot;People feel warm around food,&quot; said Steve Chen, Taiwan&apos;s economic consul in London, over dumplings and bubble tea, a Taiwanese drink featuring chewy black pearls of tapioca and sweet potato starch which he hopes will become a hit with the UK&apos;s coffee drinking set. &quot;It touches your heart, and that is what we want. &quot;It is completely different to the image we have had as a centre of industrial production. Our most important job was to promote the hi-tech industries, but that is changing and the government in Taipei has decided that the food industry is the most important item to promote, because we need to make clear there is something unique about Taiwan.&quot; The food shown off by Chen at Old Tree, his favourite restaurant, in Golders Green, north London, is a fragrant fusion of Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese cooking. There are hints of a more political intent, and one goal is to use food to ensure the world understands the difference between Taiwan and mainland China. Taiwan is often treated as wayward province by China. &quot;Taiwan has figured out it can do better outreach work through the kitchen table,&quot; said Paul Rockower, a visiting fellow at the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, who is studying gastro-diplomacy. &quot;When someone tries a sea-salt latte [a Taiwanese drink] it creates awareness about Taiwanese culture. The Koreans embarked on Kimchi diplomacy partly because their brands weren&apos;t being recognised as Korean \u2013 Samsung was being recognised as a Japanese brand.&quot; Gastro-diplomacy can cause cultural indigestion, however. Old Tree&apos;s menu features a lot of pork, which has sparked complaints from the Jewish community in Golders Green, while Malaysia&apos;s year-long campaign, run by a British PR firm in London, has overwhelmed some food writers who, with five months still to go, have grown tired of being bombarded with offers of rich Malaysian food. The differences between Israel and Lebanon were exposed earlier this year when a &quot;hummus war&quot; erupted, with both sides vying to prepare the largest bowl of hummus to claim the world record. And during indirect peace talks between Israel and Syria, Syria&apos;s president, Bashir Assad, was rumoured to have had a plate of Damascus hummus delivered to then Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert. In 2005, France&apos;s pride in its world-famous cuisine may have cost it the right to host the 2012 Olympics. Jacques Chirac, then president, was reported as criticising British and Finnish food on the eve of the final IOC vote in which Finland had two votes and London was a candidate. &quot;You can&apos;t trust people who cook as badly as that,&quot; Chirac said, according to the newspaper Liberation. &quot;After Finland, [the UK] is the country with the worst food.&quot; Stinky tofu anyone? Stinky tofu A form of fermented tofu with \u2013 don&apos;t say you weren&apos;t warned \u2013 a strong smell. Popular in east and south-east Asia, particularly Hong Kong, Taiwan and China, where it is found at night markets or roadside stands, or as a side dish in lunch bars. Bubble tea Otherwise known as pearl milk tea, this sweet beverage created in Taiwan usually contains a tea base mixed with fruit and or milk as well as small tapioca balls or pearls called boba. The tea is shaken to mix the ingredients, creating a foam on the top of some varieties, hence the name. Kimchi Korean dish made of vegetables with varied seasonings. There are hundreds of varieties made with a main vegetable ingredient such as napa cabbage, radish, green onion or cucumber. Dog meat soup Another Korean speciality, it has been claimed to increase virility.

That was Figueras.   As home to the painter Salvador Dal\u00ed and inspiration for some of his greatest and strangest artistic endeavours, the Costa Brava fishing port of Cadaqu\u00e9s is used to the surreal. But the latest project involving the north-eastern Spanish town has astonished even the cosmopolitan inhabitants of a place that boasts more art galleries per square kilometre than anywhere else in the country. A Chinese developer has decided to build a replica of the town half-way across the globe in Xiamen Bay, where mainland China looks out towards Taiwan. Architects from developers China Merchants Zhangzhou visited Cadaqu\u00e9s in June, taking measurements, photographing buildings and worrying about whether Chinese fire engines would fit down its tiny streets. Sources at the company said they had found a spot that was geographically similar to Cadaqu\u00e9s, with its gently sloping hills and protected bay. &quot;Building work will start in September or October,&quot; a spokesman said. More than 100 acres of land will be used to build a near replica with a capacity to house some 15,000 Chinese holidaymakers who want to enjoy the Costa Brava experience without having to travel 6,500 miles. The Chinese version will not have the sparkling Mediterranean, the madness-inducing Tramontana wind or as many jellyfish as Cadaqu\u00e9s, but the promoters say they will try to get as close to possible to the real thing. &quot;We will recreate the essence of the fishing town and will reproduce the most characteristic elements of the architecture in a space which has a similar coastline,&quot; one of the architects, Hu Zheng, told the Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia . That will mean copying the narrow streets and the white-painted buildings that look out across the perfect, open-mouthed bay where small, brightly painted fishing craft bob up and down. The promoters of the Chinese resort have decided they can improve a bit on the original, however, and will be adding an artificial island. Among other buildings the architects were keen to see were the warren-like collection of fishermen&apos;s cottages in neighbouring Portlligat, where Dal\u00ed lived. Topped with a giant egg sculpture, this is where the Spanish surrealist painted many of his most famous works \u2013 including a portrait of his Russian wife Gala looking out to sea. It is also where he indulged his fondness for voyeurism, encouraging selected guests to perform sex acts in front of him. Visitors to the house today are greeted by the same stuffed, wild bear with which Dal\u00ed tried to frighten away unwanted guests. The Chinese developers told officials in Cadaqu\u00e9s that they also wanted to make art a central part of the new town, with space for galleries and offers to some local Spanish artists to show their work there. &quot;We like the idea and the way they are treating us,&quot; said Joan Borrell, mayor of Cadaqu\u00e9s. &quot;We are small but well-known. If they want to imitate you then it means you must have got something right.&quot; Borrell said he hoped the Xiamen version would eventually attract Chinese tourists to the real thing. &quot;As with a work of art, seeing the copy often makes you want to see the original,&quot; he said. &quot;That would be wonderful for Cadaqu\u00e9s and for the whole of the Costa Brava.&quot; This is the second attempt to build a replica of the fishing town somewhere else in the world. A previous attempt was made at a Caribbean beach in the Dominican Republic, but Cadaqu\u00e9s says it was not consulted and does not recognise it as a genuine imitation. China Merchants Zhangzhou declined to comment officially on the project, though sources at the company confirmed that the project was still on track. Dal\u00ed would undoubtedly have approved of the endeavour. One of his favourite money-making habits was to sign, and sell-off, blank sheets of paper for prints and lithographs. As a result, he is one of the most frequently copied and forged artists in the world. Made in China Shanghai has built a version of Paris on its doorstep, complete with a scaled-down replica of the Eiffel Tower. The development has full-sized houses and boulevards and was designed to house up to 100,000 people. Thomas Hardy&apos;s vision of Dorchester inspired Chinese town planners to build a replica of the English village for wealthy Chinese families in Chengdu, central China. Eager buyers flocked to the development, which is called &quot;British Town&quot;. A Himalayan town was used by the Chinese to create a tourist version of Shangri-la. The project was inspired by English writer James Hilton&apos;s 1933 novel Lost Horizon where he describes Shangri-la as an imaginary Himalayan utopia. The &quot;new&quot; Shangri-la was declared a tourist paradise by order of the Chinese government. A Chinese businessman drew up plans for a lasting tribute to singer Michael Jackson by building his own Neverland ranch on an island near Shanghai. The cost was expected to be about $15m and the site would include a man-made lake, cinema and a zoo.

The division of Microsoft behind the account, however, makes keyboards, webcams and mice so it&apos;s more likely that the flat matt black device in the photos is Microsoft&apos;s rival to Apple&apos;s recently announced trackpad. Also Microsoft has a patchy record when it comes to consumer trends. While the Xbox has taken a valuable place in the games console market, its Zune portable music player is still years behind Apple&apos;s iPod in terms of sales.Last month chief executive Steve Ballmer said developing Windows-based tablet computers is &quot;job one urgency&quot; for the software group. He added &quot;we have got to make things happen with Windows 7 on slates&quot; but while the firm&apos;s latest PC version of its software has touch capabilities, analysts have warned that putting the whole operating system on a tablet will mean manufacturers will have to use a lot of memory and fast processors on the device, which will increase its price. Also they question whether Microsoft still has the tablet market wrong: consumers do not want to do everything they can do on a desktop on a tablet. It is not merely a new form factor, it is a new kind of device. Some manufacturers are looking at whether its Windows Phone software - which also enables touch as well as the viewing of Microsoft Office documents - is not a better system on which to base Microsoft tablets. Either way, Ballmer said Microsoft is working with partners including Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Asus, Dell, Samsung, Toshiba, and Sony on tablets. Many of those firms, however, also have other software in mind. Google, meanwhile, has long been rumoured to be working on its tablet computer, most recently in conjunction with Verizon (that story, however, may have been a confusion of the recent news that Verizon is actually working with Motorola to produce a tablet device aimed at the home entertainment market and running Google&apos;s Android software). But there are questions as to why Google needs an own-brand tablet while many manufacturers are to produce their devices based on its Android. The company was planning a smartphone called the Nexus One because it feared that the iPhone was running away with the market and the industry needed to be shown what could be done with Android. But now that a plethora of good quality Android devices are appearing, Google has halted the Nexus programme. The real question among technology watchers is whether Google will work closely with one or two tablet manufacturers to create devices based on its Chrome OS software, which is aimed at web-enabled laptops and is due out later this year. The handset makers Several mobile phone manufacturers are already working on tablets based on Google&apos;s Android. First out of the blocks will be a tablet from Samsung. The Korean hardware company is expected to give more details today but it will run Android and have a 7 inch screen, making it smaller than the iPad, but including a camera and accept memory cards. There is also talk of a second device with a tablet screen on one side and e-book reader on the other. While its first tablet is likely to use Android, Samsung also seems to want to use its new Bada operating system - which is used by its recently launched Wave mobile phone - for tablets. It remains to be seen whether consumers will want yet another operating system to deal with. Domestic rival, LG, is also working on an Android-based tablet which is scheduled for launch by the end of the year. RIM, the company behind the BlackBerry, is rumoured to be working on a rival to the iPad, dubbed the BlackPad, which is scheduled for launch in November. Nokia, meanwhile, tried to enter the so-called netbook market with its own 3G Booklet last year. It ran Windows 7 and was hardly a success. Since then, the Finnish mobile phone company has teamed up with Intel to develop software better suited to laptops and tablets, under the MeeGo banner. The first device is likely to be a smartphone which could be out for Christmasand Nokia seems to be in no rush to produce a tablet. Motorola is working with Verizon on an Android-powered tablet. The question is whether HTC will follow up its success in the Android-powered smartphone market with a tablet. The PC manufacturers Tablets running Windows have been in the market for some time from manufacturers such as France&apos;s Archos while Lenovo, HP and others have released laptops \u2013 called convertibles \u2013 whose screens swivel to turn them into tablets. Taiwan&apos;s Acer and China&apos;s Asus are preparing tablets with Microsoft software. The latter will also release tablets using Android. But many consumers will prefer a household name when they take the plunge into tablets. One of the first was the Streak from Dell, but it is smaller than the iPad and seems more like a smartphone. BT, wants to get in on the tablet act and is developing a touchscreen version of the traditional landline telephone, which raises the unwelcome spectre of Amstrad&apos;s failed eMailer device. Toshiba has produced a dual-screen tablet running Windows 7 and is working on a single screen tablet called SmartPad, which may run Android. Hewlett-Packard, meanwhile, is believed to have been working on a device called the Zeen which runs Android and looks more like an e-reader. Tech watchers reckon HP&apos;s real push into tablets will come on the back of its recent acquisition of smartphone designer Palm. The e-reader market, of course, already has the Kindle from Amazon - which has just been upgraded - and the Sony e-Reader, although both are likely to be superseded, over time, by tablets."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/aug/17/apple-manager", "publicationDate": "2010-08-17T09:10:30Z", "tags": ["Apple", "Computing", "Technology", "Business"], "sentences": ["Other companies named in the indictment include Pegatron, which is the manufacturing unit of the netbook PC pioneer Asustek; Singapore&apos;s Glocom/Lateral Solutions and Fastening Technologies; and Taiwan&apos;s Nishoku Technology."], "title": "Apple manager denies bribery charge", "article": "An Apple executive pleaded not guilty last night to charges that he took bribes from Asian suppliers in return for inside information.

Apple also filed a separate civil lawsuit against Devine last Friday, claiming breach of contract, racketeering and breaching fiduciary duty.

It argues that despite modest improvements in the PLA&apos;s openness, &quot;the limited transparency in China&apos;s military and security affairs enhances uncertainty and increases the potential for misunderstanding and miscalculation.&quot; The PLA has issued reports on its work and attempted to improve links with other militaries in recent years, engaging in more joint exercises and taking part in peacekeeping missions. But Shi Yinhong, an expert on Sino-US relations at Renmin University, said: &quot;Although China has steadily increased its military transparency over the past few years, it&apos;s currently impossible for China to reach the level that the US demands.&quot; This year China announced that the military budget would rise by 7.5% to 532.11bn yuan (\u00a351.7bn), after two decades of double-digit annual increases. Experts suggested the slowdown reflected Chinese concerns about the way it was perceived, as well as financial constraints. China argues that spending remains well below US levels and that US capabilities remain far superior. The Pentagon believes that China&apos;s actual military spending is roughly double the stated level. Its report says China has the most active land-based ballistic and cruise missile programme in the world and that it is developing an anti-ship ballistic missile with a range of more than 1,500km, capable of attacking aircraft carriers in the western Pacific. It adds that analysts believe China will not have a domestically produced aircraft carrier and associated ships for another five years, although foreign assistance could speed that process up. It also predicts: &quot;It is unlikely ... that China will be able to project and sustain large forces in high-intensity combat operations far from China until well into the following decade.&quot; Beijing suspended military-to-military ties between the countries in January, in retaliation for US arms sales to Taiwan. The report notes that while Beijing has improved economic and cultural ties with Taiwan, it has continued the build-up of missiles opposite the island and expanded its military advantage. Last month Beiing reacted angrily when the US secretary of state waded into the territorial dispute over the South China Sea between China and several regional powers including Vietnam and the Philippines. Hillary Clinton said resolving the row was a diplomatic priority and was in the national interest of the US. Other countries complain that China is taking a tougher line on the dispute. It recently began describing rights over the strategic waterway \u2013 which is also potentially rich in natural resources \u2013 as a &quot;core interest&quot;.

Zhu Feng, of Peking University&apos;s School of International Studies, said the combination of issues had led to an &quot;unprecedented surge&quot; in tensions but that the prospect of conflict remained low. Drew Thompson, a China expert at the Nixon Centre in Washington, warned: &quot;The US military and the Chinese military don&apos;t have a common understanding, a rules of the road, for navigation.

But what&apos;s wrong with the rest of the manufacturers? &quot;Just because you&apos;re green on one side of your life, that doesn&apos;t justify just ignoring another part. You should be as green as you can be,&quot; says Diego Lombardi, co-owner of new start-up cycle maker Racer Rosa Bicycles. While bicycles are undeniably a green and pleasant form of transport, their production is largely tainted. If you&apos;ve bought a high-end bike from a big name manufacturer recently, then it may well have been air-freighted and its production certainly involved planet-damaging chemicals \u2013 particularly so if it was made from carbon fibre. For most cyclists, there is little ethical and environmental consideration of the manufacture of the bike itself \u2013 something Lombardi is keen to counter: &quot;Multinational bike companies are like McDonalds. They produce disposable products for maximum profit.&quot; While an estimated 95% of bikes sold are produced in Taiwan or China, Racer Rosa prides itself on riding in the opposite direction. Lombardi assembles bikes in his Walthamstow, east London, workshop. The frames are made-to-measure from recycled Italian steel, by Italian craftsmen. Then they&apos;re shipped by sea to the UK. The entire process, from measuring you to the arrival of the assembled bike, takes six weeks. Of course, several other British bike makers build their frames in the UK. &quot;We would love to do everything here,&quot; says Lombardi. &quot;But we cannot find British-sourced steel or reliable frame makers.&quot; Britain&apos;s big bike tube maker, Reynolds, sources some steel from America, according to Lombardi. &quot;The quality of the silver fillet brazing we get is also very rare.&quot; These are the joins between the steel tubes that form the frame \u2013 and certainly the bright blue, minimalist bikes dotting Racer Rosa&apos;s workshop are a study in clean lines and retro chic, with none of the lumps associated with modern welding techniques. Racer Rosa&apos;s ethos doesn&apos;t just extend to frames though. Lombardi encourages buyers to use secondhand parts \u2013 taken off their old bikes and refurbished by Lombardi, or from vintage sources of quality &quot;warehouse leftovers&quot; that Racer Rosa sources. New parts, where used, are picked for quality and environmental credentials \u2013 using companies who manufacture entirely in the EU. The end result is that the average Racer Rosa bike is more than 90% manufactured in Europe. &quot;Tyres all seem to be outsourced to Taiwan, but we&apos;re trying to find alternatives,&quot; says Lombardi. The next step for the company, only running since February (Lombardi has been repairing friends&apos; bikes for years), is sourcing greener bike consumables \u2013 chain oil, cleaning products etc. Even the office and workshop equipment is all secondhand. Racer Rosa employs freelance bike mechanics, but also an ethical researcher to further improve its credentials. Based in east London, Racer Rosa is keen to expand by &quot;riding the wave&quot; of the cycling fashion explosion in the area: &quot;We want to colour east London blue,&quot; says Lombardi, referring to Racer Rosa&apos;s paint colour of choice. There is, of course, a downside to such niche, environmentally and artisan-friendly bike buying: the cost. Racer Rosa refurbishments of existing bikes start from \u00a3500, new bikes start from \u00a31,000. To which Lombardi points out that you can pay much the same for &quot;a custom-made bike from a niche brand and the frame would be made in Taiwan or China&quot;. &quot;I&apos;d rather shop at my local market, than a big supermarket,&quot; says Lombardi. &quot;My soul is at peace when I ride a bike made by a small, family business. It&apos;s a return to an arts and crafts approach.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/aug/27/andymurray-usopentennis", "publicationDate": "2010-08-26T23:22:40Z", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "US Open tennis", "Rafael Nadal", "Sport", "Tennis", "US Open Tennis 2010"], "sentences": ["(4) Andy Murray (Britain) v Lukas Lacko (Slovakia), Ruben Ramirez Hidalgo (Spain) v Dustin Brown (Jamaica), Juan Ignacio Chela (Argentina) v Yen-Hsun Lu (Taiwan), Mikhail Kukushkin (Kazkakstan) v (25) Stanislas Wawrinka (Switzerland), (20) Sam Querrey (US) v Bradley Klahn (US), Marcel Granollers (Spain) v Andreas Seppi (Italy), Guillermo Garcia-Lopez (Spain) v Lukasz Kubot (Poland), Potito Starace (Italy) v (14) Nicolas Almagro (Spain), (12) Mikhail Youzhny (Russia) v Andrey Golubev (Kazakhstan), Dudi Sela (Israel) v Xavier Malisse (Belgium), Jack Sock (US) v Marco Chiudinelli (Switzerland), Frederico Gil (Portugal) v (18) John Isner (US) (28) Radek Stepanek (Czech Republic) v Julien Benneteau (France), Tommy Robredo (Spain) v Qualifier, Victor Hanescu (Romania) v Carlos Berlocq (Argentina), Michael Llodra (France) v (7) Tomas Berdych (Czech Republic)."], "title": "Andy Murray faces tricky tests before a possible clash with Rafa Nadal", "article": "Andy Murray will have to beat Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals to win the US Open, which might be slightly the lesser of two evils in that the favourite, Roger Federer, is parked on the other side of the draw. The Scot plays the No72-rated Lukas Lacko of Slovakia first up at Flushing Meadows; Nadal plays the Russian Teimuraz Gabashvili. Murray, seeded four, has beaten the top-seeded Spaniard four times in the past five matches on hard courts, and only two weeks ago won his first tournament of the season, beating both Nadal and Federer in the Rogers Cup in Toronto. Lacko, 22, has a strong forehand and big serve well suited to hard courts. He moved into the top 100 last November after winning a Challenger tournament in Seoul. He has recent wins over Lleyton Hewitt and Marcos Baghdatis. After Lacko, Murray is scheduled to meet the winner of Spain&apos;s Rub\u00e9n Ram\u00edrez Hidalgo and Dustin Brown, the Jamaican who wants to play Davis Cup for Great Britain, and who qualifies through his grandmother. Also lying in wait, in round three, is the big-serving Stanislas Wawrinka, who took Murray to five sets at Wimbledon last year. He is seeded 25th here, but is considered one of the dangerous players on the circuit. Further into the draw for Nadal could be the likes of the talented Frenchman Gilles Simon and the German Philipp Kohlschreiber, who embarrassed Murray in just over an hour at Monte Carlo when he was enduring his horror patch of the summer. Nadal, who has reached the semi-finals here the past two years but never won the title, also has Fernando Verdasco and the resurgent David Nalbandian in his path. Federer, the favourite with the bookmakers to add his sixth US title to his 16 slams, has one serious threat in his way en route to the semis: Sweden&apos;s Robin Soderling, who demolished him on the clay of Paris this year, but has been less effective on other surfaces since. First up for the Swiss \u2013 who returned to form in Cincinnati on Sunday, his first tournament win in seven months \u2013 will be the Argentinian lefty Brian Dabul but there is no seed on his radar until Hewitt in round three. Hewitt beat Federer on the grass of Halle, just before Wimbledon, his first victory over him in 16 attempts and only Federer&apos;s second loss on the surface in 77 matches. Andy Roddick and Novak Djokovic are also in their half of the draw. The women&apos;s event is wide open, since the withdrawal through injury last week of Serena Williams. Denmark&apos;s Caroline Wozniacki, seeded one, plays the American Chelsey Gullickson in the first round. Britain&apos;s leading player, Elena Baltacha, has drawn the Croatian Petra Martic, who came from a set and 3-5 down to beat her in the opening round of Wimbledon. &quot;It is quite funny how it works out,&quot; Baltacha said, &quot;because I played her in the first round of the last grand slam and I was two points away from winning that one.It&apos;s a good chance to get revenge but, of course, she&apos;s dangerous and I know that better than anyone. &quot; Laura Robson pulled off an upset when she beat the former world No4 Jelena Dokic 6-1, 6-4 in qualifying. The 16-year-old joins her fellow Briton Katie O&apos;Brien in the second qualification round. Alex Bogdanovic had to retire with a back injury against the American Blake Strode.

According to this video interview with the restaurant&apos;s supposed owner, it was to have been his second restaurant, the original, Flim\u00e9, being located in Brazil near a Wari reservation. The illusion was bolstered by this website where members are presented with a health questionnaire and asked to decide which body part they want to donate. Despite laying themselves wide open to accusations of crass insensitivity, the people behind it have scored a major publicity coup around what would have been the ultimate theme restaurant. In fact, whether there&apos;s any substance to this story or not, the reality is in many ways even worse. Just what is it about this curious subset that appeals to restaurant-goers? There&apos;s a new restaurant called Shaka Zulu just opened in Camden that has had the more schadenfreude-inclined of the capital&apos;s restaurant-watchers in something of a lather. Improbably vast and elaborate, it purports to offer the authentic taste of Africa (seared ostrich carpaccio with peppadews, anyone?) in an atmosphere of Zulu extravagance. We restaurant critics are all happily sharpening our knives because, oddly, there&apos;s nothing anyone loves more than a truly venomous review. I haven&apos;t been yet, because I like a place to find its level before piling in, but the only thing to properly astonish me about the place would be if the food were any good. Have you ever had a decent dinner in a theme restaurant? I know I haven&apos;t. From the purgatory endured by taking children to the Rainforest Caf\u00e9 (sub-TGI&apos;s food heavily reliant on the deep fryer and dodgy animatronics that actually put the fear of Armageddon into the kids) to the hilariously awful Dans le Noir, the words &quot;theme restaurant&quot; usually have me blanching with horror. As the Flim\u00e9 story demonstrates, Britain&apos;s most outr\u00e9 offerings are positively vanilla compared what happens overseas, especially in Asia. (Having said that, there is now an outfit in London offering the revolting practice of nyotaimori \u2013 literally, &quot;female body plate&quot;, or eating sushi off the body of a naked woman. Deepest joy.) I&apos;ve eaten in Catholic / Goth themed Christon Cafe in Tokyo, me and a million giggling teens, but compared with what else is actually out there: pah! A bit of research throws up (pun intended) the kind of thing that would profoundly, even permanently, put me off my dinner. Who needs Weight Watchers when all you have to do is call to mind Marton, a &quot;Modern Toilet Diner&quot; in Taipei? Here, customers sit on seats shaped like lavs, scarfing carefully sculpted chocolate ice-cream \u2013 I don&apos;t have to spell it out, surely? \u2013 out of mini toilet bowls.  The Taiwanese do seem particularly keen on the furthest reaches of acceptable taste. The curiously monickered DS Music Restaurant in Taipei is themed round hospitals, with cute, sexy nurses squirting drinks into your gob from IV-type apparatuses. Fortunately, the city&apos;s Holocaust restaurant didn&apos;t last. Also unsurprisingly out of business is Sehnsucht (&quot;Longing&quot;), the Berlin outfit that catered for, yes, anorexics.  Death is a recurring topic for some entirely bizarre reason, with the likes of the demised Eternity in the Ukraine, which was cosily located inside the world&apos;s largest coffin, or the restaurant in Ahmadabad, India which is actually inside a Muslim cemetery. Its name? The New Lucky. Perhaps reminding ourselves of our inevitable end adds a little piquancy to dinner.  See also, randomly, prisons: Chain Cool in Beijing, The Jail in Taiwan (again), and even in the UK, the likes of The Clink where not only are you dining inside an actual prison (High Down), but you&apos;re served and catered to by actual inmates. The Clink&apos;s aims are entirely admirable, providing rehabilitation opportunities for offenders, but if you&apos;re looking for something more tasteless, how about The Hobbit House in Manila? Owned by a Lord of the Rings freak, it&apos;s staffed entirely by, um, people of restricted growth. Mind you, the Ukraine also has the Masoch Caf\u00e9, dedicated to that cheery inventor of masochism, so it&apos;s up there with Taiwan.  Of course, themed outfits aren&apos;t new, but once upon a time they were a little cooler than they are today, like the heavenly Le Macabre in swinging 60s Soho. Nowadays, there&apos;s something about theming that just screams impossibly naff. The maddest thing is how many of these extraordinary gaffs not only survive, but thrive (see the aforementioned Dans le Noir and Manchester&apos;s Hellfire Club, whose menu items include Creature of the Swamp and Cannibal Holocaust, &quot;served with a selection of garnish vegetables and potatoes or chunky chips&quot;). Am I and my foodie muckers just being the most insufferable snobs and does everyone really love this kind of thing? Can it really be true that the quality of the food is less important than being served by someone dressed as a schoolgirl brandishing a whippy little cane? Please tell me it ain&apos;t so."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/aug/31/vietnam-us-military-china", "publicationDate": "2010-08-31T22:32:00Z", "tags": ["Vietnam", "China", "US foreign policy", "US military", "World news", "US news", "Hillary Clinton", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["China claims sovereignty over the entire 3.5m square-kilometre south China sea, dotted with disputed groups of islands that are also claimed in whole or in part by Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines.", "China upped the ante when it recently upgraded its claim to the south China sea to a &quot;core interest&quot;, putting it on par with Beijing&apos;s claims over Taiwan and Tibet.", "Beijing suspended military-to-military ties between the countries in January, in retaliation for US arms sales to Taiwan."], "title": "Vietnam, unlikely US ally | Mark Tran", "article": "The presence of the USS George Washington, a nuclear supercarrier, off Vietnam earlier this month signalled a deepening rapprochement between two former enemies in the face of an increasingly assertive China. Coming 35 years after the end of the Vietnam war, the visit officially marked the 15th anniversary of normalisation of relations between the US and Vietnam. A group of high-ranking Vietnamese military officials was flown aboard the ship, along with other Vietnamese government dignitaries and the US ambassador to Vietnam, as both sides turned on the charm. But the supercarrier&apos;s visit also sent a clear political message to China: the US also has a stake in what China thinks is its own backyard. A few days later, Admiral Robert Willard, the head of the US Pacific command, spelt out those interests during a visit to the Philippines when he told reporters that the US military opposed any use of force to settle territorial disputes in the south China sea. China claims sovereignty over the entire 3.5m square-kilometre south China sea, dotted with disputed groups of islands that are also claimed in whole or in part by Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines. Chinese forces seized the western Paracel islands from Vietnam in 1974 and sank three Vietnamese navy ships in a 1988 sea battle.  More recently, China has arrested Vietnamese fishermen, issued threats against multinational oil companies operating in Vietnamese waters, ramped up naval exercises and established a submarine base on Hainan island. Also in dispute are the Spratly islands. The area straddles busy sea lanes and is estimated by China to hold oil and natural gas reserves of 17.7bn tonnes.  China upped the ante when it recently upgraded its claim to the south China sea to a &quot;core interest&quot;, putting it on par with Beijing&apos;s claims over Taiwan and Tibet. Willard&apos;s comments reinforced remarks made last month by the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, that irked China. Clinton told a conference of south-east and east Asian ministers that the US had a &quot;national interest&quot; in seeing the territorial disputes resolved through a &quot;collaborative diplomatic process by all claimants&quot;. China&apos;s assertiveness is pushing the US and Vietnam closer, particularly on military matters. The two countries held their inaugural US-Vietnam defence policy dialogue in Hanoi on 19 August, seen as a turning point in relations between the two former enemies. Carl Thayer, professor of politics at the Australian defence force academy in Canberra, wrote in the Wall Street Journal:  &quot;Clearly, recent Chinese military assertiveness in the western Pacific and the south China sea provides a stimulus for stepped-up US-Vietnam military cooperation. Both countries share an interest in preventing China or any other country from dominating seaborne trade routes and enforcing territorial claims through coercion. Vietnam sees the US presence as a hedge against China&apos;s rising military power.&quot;  Following on from their defence dialogue, the US defence secretary, Robert Gates, is to visit Vietnam in October, marking the fourth meeting with his Vietnamese counterpart in just two years and the two countries are to hold their first military-to-military talks will be held at the end of the year. The sale of arms, equipment and military technology is not on the cards at the moment, Thayer says, but he thinks it likely that Vietnam will lift its self-imposed restrictions and allow its military officers to undertake professional military education and training courses at staff colleges and other military institutions in the US. It is not just military cooperation that is growing. The US is said to be negotiating a controversial agreement with Vietnam to provide nuclear fuel and technology \u2013 without the usual constraints on enriching uranium to prevent proliferation. Vietnamese officials stress that co-operation between the US and Vietnam &quot;does not do any harm to any other countries&quot;, and China, so far, has spared Vietnam the kind of abrasive language it has directed at the US. But Vietnam will be all too aware that Chinese patience has limits \u2013 the two fraternal communist countries fought a brief war in 1979, after falling out with each other over Cambodia. &quot;Vietnam is taking a leaf out of China&apos;s book in building up its diplomatic alliances across the board,&quot; says Kerry Brown, an Asia expert at Chatham House, the foreign affairs thinktank.   &quot;Having a stronger link with the US will give the Chinese pause for thought, no matter what gestures they might make in asserting themselves in the region. They now know that America has delivered a view on this whole issue, and that means that they can&apos;t live in the pleasing world of vagueness that prevailed till then. The bottom line now is that whatever China does in the south China sea has just become that bit more sensitive, and will impact on its relations with the US. The Vietnamese can now exploit this. That is exactly what they intend to do.&quot;  As the US and Vietnam cozy up to each other militarily, defence cooperation between the US and China remains at a standstill. Beijing suspended military-to-military ties between the countries in January, in retaliation for US arms sales to Taiwan. A Pentagon report issued a week ago heightened China&apos;s irritation with the US. The annual Pentagon report to congress on China&apos;s military said secrecy surrounding China&apos;s military buildup increased the potential for misunderstanding and conflict with other countries. It also said China was developing more advanced weapons systems and pursuing the construction of aircraft carriers and ballistic missiles capable of attacking targets more than 930 miles away.  China reacted angrily to the report, saying that it was not &quot;not beneficial to the improvement and development of Sino-US military ties&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/01/tesco-bids-carrefour-asian-stores", "publicationDate": "2010-09-01T19:31:22Z", "tags": ["Tesco", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Supermarkets", "Retail industry", "Business", "UK news", "France", "Thailand", "Malaysia", "Singapore", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Five years ago Tesco did a store swap with Carrefour, handing the French group six Tesco stores in Taiwan in return for 11 Carrefour outlets in the Czech Republic."], "title": "Tesco bids to increase dominance of Asian market with basket of Carrefour stores", "article": "Tesco has put in a bid for more than 60\u00a0stores in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, currently owned by its French rival Carrefour, as part of its strategy to conquer Asia and cement its position as a global force in supermarket retailing. The French hypermarket group put the stores on the market after a strategic decision to pull out of Asian countries where it stood no chance of becoming market leader. Tesco is already the market leader in Thailand and Malaysia, and more than a third of its shopfloor space is in Asia. The Cheshunt-based retail group has operated in Asia for more than a decade. It has more than 1,230 shops in Asia and expects to open another 270 by February 2011. It views the region as &quot;a significant long-term opportunity&quot; even though its like-for-like sales in Thailand, Malaysia and Japan went into reverse last year as a result of the economic downturn and local political problems in Thailand. Tesco has particularly ambitious plans for China, where it intends to open 80 vast shopping malls in the country by 2016. Earlier this year chief executive Sir Terry Leahy said: &quot;We have continued to invest through the downturn to ensure that we will be in an even stronger position as the economies recover.&quot; The deadline for first bids for the Carrefour stores closed Tesco is understood to be among about 10 groups to have tabled initial bids. Others include the Japanese Aeon group, Dairy Farm of Singapore and the French Casino group. The stores are expected to fetch about $1bn (\u00a3647m) and Carrefour may decide to sell them piecemeal, if single-store or country sales will achieve a better price. The portfolio consists of 40 supermarkets in Thailand, 19 in Malaysia and two in Singapore. Tesco currently has 571 stores in Thailand, including 110 hypermarkets, and 29 shops in Malaysia, of which 28 are hypermarkets. It plans to open another 50 outlets in the two countries by March 2011. It currently has no presence in Singapore. One supermarket executive said Tesco would undoubtedly be keen to snap up the Carrefour chain: &quot;Only a few portfolios like this come along and only a few retailers have the wherewithal to consider it. They would be mad not to run a tape measure over it.&quot; Two years ago Tesco paid $1.9bn for 36 Homever stores in South Korea, which it bought from E-Land, which had bought them from Carrefour for a similar price two years earlier. At the time, they were making a loss but the rebranded Homeplus shops are now trading profitably, with double-digit like-for-like sales. Korea is now Tesco&apos;s largest international business; in April, Tesco said sales there were \u00a34.5bn and profits were almost \u00a3300m. Five years ago Tesco did a store swap with Carrefour, handing the French group six Tesco stores in Taiwan in return for 11 Carrefour outlets in the Czech Republic."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/09/japan-china-fishing-boat-collision", "publicationDate": "2010-09-09T11:20:25Z", "tags": ["Japan", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The Japanese-controlled islands, which are also claimed by Taiwan, are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and, possibly, oil and gas deposits."], "title": "Japan-China row escalates over fishing boat collision", "article": "A territorial row between Japan and China worsened today after officials threatened to prosecute the captain of a Chinese fishing boat that collided with Japanese patrol ships near disputed islands. Reports said Zhan Qixiong could face up to three years in prison if found guilty of causing the collision on Tuesday, but that he could be released without charge within days if he admitted obstructing coastguard officials. No one was injured in the incident and the Japanese boats sustained minor damage. Zhan, 41, was handed over to prosecutors on the southern Japanese island of Ishigaki for questioning after his boat struck two coastguard ships near Senkaku, a chain of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea. The territory, known as Diaoyu in China, is a focal point for competing territorial claims as Tokyo and Beijing step up their search for resources in the area. The Japanese-controlled islands, which are also claimed by Taiwan, are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and, possibly, oil and gas deposits. The 14 other crew on the Chinese fishing boat were not arrested, but are being questioned as witnesses. China said today it had sent a maritime law enforcement vessel to the area, but it was not clear whether it would patrol the islands or collect the stranded fishermen. Japan&apos;s coastguard said the collision occurred after Zhan ignored requests to leave the area and then refused to allow Japanese officials to inspect his boat. China&apos;s state media warned that Japan&apos;s handling of the incident risked escalating tensions. &quot;A wave of indignation is brewing in Chinese society, which might snowball into a major public outcry if the Japanese authorities continue to take a hardline stance,&quot; the China Daily said. China summoned Japan&apos;s ambassador twice in 24 hours to protest about Zhan&apos;s arrest and a small group of Chinese nationalists demonstrated yesterday outside the Japanese embassy in Beijing. Internet chatrooms have been buzzing with messages condemning Tokyo&apos;s response, with some calling for a boycott of Japanese goods. A foreign ministry spokesman in Tokyo said Japan had a duty to investigate the collision, adding that its sovereignty over the islands was an &quot;undeniable fact&quot;. Both sides, however, said the incident would not affect diplomatic ties. &quot;We will handle the matter firmly in accordance with the law,&quot; Yoshito Sengoku, Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, said. &quot;It is important that in Japan we not get overly excited.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/sep/10/1", "publicationDate": "2010-09-10T08:00:51Z", "tags": ["Media"], "sentences": ["With Matt Wells, Stephen Brook, and Moz Dee Viral Video ChartThe most fun you can have with a bear and some Tippex Wayne Garvie to join All3MediaBBC Worldwide international production supremo moves to similar role at super-indie that makes Skins and Hollyoaks Kay Burley accused of being &apos;a bit dim&apos; by Labour MP Chris BryantSky News presenter has on-air spat with MP during interview about News of the World phone-hacking story  Google launches display ad campaign for its display adsDisplay advertising is an increasing focus for the search giant Murdoch v the New York Times: the animated movieTaiwan&apos;s Next Media offers its distinctive take on the WSJ-NYT battle Ikea ads switch from guerrillas to catsMother London&apos;s first spot for the furniture chain involves releasing 100 cats to snuggle up in its Wembley branch Dog has its day in Thinkbox campaign for power of TV advertisingRescue mutt advertises television advertising by advertising itself on television in push for commercial broadcasters What will Google Instant do to &apos;SEO&apos; - and to its own AdWords system?&apos;Search engine optimisation&apos; experts are scrambling to figure out what Google&apos;s new system will do to their work - but the effect on advertisers might not be trivial either"], "title": "Today's media stories from the papers", "article": "Top stories on MediaGuardian.co.uk Murdoch blasted as MPs rage at phone hackingPoliticians use parliamentary privilege to attack police inquiry and target News International figures over claims Peter Morgan: I can do one more Blair film Writer says he feels the need to follow up The Special Relationship as he and Michael Sheen &apos;haven&apos;t nailed Blair yet&apos; David Montgomery to make &apos;planned retirement&apos;Founder of European newspaper group says he will leave in January, after news breaks of shareholder pressure for change This week&apos;s featured media jobs Oxford University Press - Assistant Marketing ManagersOxford/permanent/full time Haymarket - Project EditorLondon/permanent/full time Medaxial - Medical/Economic WriterLondon/permanent/full time For more jobs, career advice and workplace news visit guardianjobs.co.uk Today&apos;s headlines The GuardianPhone hacking latest.

Apart from eating bamboo, this is something that pandas are very good at. China&apos;s State Forestry Administration, which officially &quot;owns&quot; the animal, has ordered the keepers at Oji zoo in Kobe, Japan not to interfere with the panda&apos;s corpse until a crack team of Chinese experts arrives to investigate. This tough talk has caused some eyebrows to be raised in the west. But only by those who fail to appreciate the immense importance of the panda to modern China. Quite surprisingly, China showed little interest in this beautiful, rare and exclusively Chinese animal until the Chinese Communist party came to power. It was only then that the panda began to emerge as a &quot;national treasure&quot; almost synonymous with the Chinese nation itself. In a forthcoming book Panda Nation: Nature, Science, and Nationalism in the People&apos;s Republic of China, American historian Elena Songster argues that one of the reasons the panda was such a suitable emblem for the bold, new state was that it was completely free of associations with China&apos;s imperial past. Indeed, there are no known representations of the panda in Chinese art before the 20th century. So while many subjects were off limits for artists during China&apos;s turbulent cultural revolution, the panda was not, says Songster. Another great feature of the panda, at least as far as Chairman Mao Zedong and his followers were concerned, was that the rest of the world, particularly the west, had become obsessed by its excruciatingly cute looks and behaviour. So between 1957 and the 1980s, the CCP gave more than 20 pandas as gifts to around 10 different countries, including Britain. Since the late 1990s, China has been offering pairs of pandas to foreign zoos on long-term research loans. In exchange, China demands about $500,000 per pair per year over a 10-year period, money it must use to benefit wild pandas. Nevertheless, China will sometimes still deploy pandas for overtly political purposes. In 1999, a few years after the British handed Hong Kong back to the Chinese, the PRC gifted the region a couple of pandas and followed them up with another pair to mark the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong&apos;s return to Chinese sovereignty. In 2008, after several earlier offers, Taiwan finally accepted a panda gift from China. The names of the animals, Tuan-Tuan and Yuan-Yuan, meaning &quot;reunion&quot;, caused a considerable stir in Taiwan. There is at least one precedent for this latest panda-related controversy unfolding in Japan. In 2007, a female panda that had been on loan from China to Germany for more than a decade died unexpectedly in Berlin Zoo. The postmortem, conducted by German vets, pronounced that she&apos;d suffered a heart failure as a result of acute constipation. When China did not accept the verdict and demanded compensation, the zoo invited in a delegation to conduct their own investigation. The Chinese never took up this offer, says the zoo, and the dead panda is still on ice in the mortuary. In the Japanese case, China appears to be asserting itself more forcefully. There are probably several reasons for this: it is likely to have learned from the episode with Germany; the historical confrontations between China and Japan are almost certainly cranking up the tensions; and China, with the panda as its cuddly face, is prepared to show increasing swagger on the global stage."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/sep/17/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2010-09-17T05:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology"], "sentences": ["The main target is netbooks, and Intel will need a greatly improved selection before AppUp comes close to enhancing netbooks in the way that Apple&apos;s App Store enhances iPhone, iPad and iTouch, which is the obvious model.&quot; HTC to offer Android 3.0 tablet PC in 1Q11, say Taiwan component makers &gt;&gt; DigitimesThe article begins: &quot;HTC plans to launch a tablet PC, possibly equipped with Android 3, in the first quarter of 2011, according to Taiwan-based component makers.&quot; Note the diference between headline and first sentence."], "title": "The Technology newsbucket: the empty app store, Android 3.0 tablet?, Halo's bucks and more", "article": "     A quick burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Intel AppUp is Up, but underwhelming &gt;&gt; Tim Anderson&apos;s ITWritingWhat if they gave an app store, and nobody had bothered to populate it? &quot;Intel has launched AppUp, its application store for Windows and Moblin/MeeGo Linux...Who knows, AppUp may have a bright future, but Intel could have done better with the launch.

Apple is expected to launch the second-generation iPad in the first-quarter of 2011, the suppliers noted.&quot; This report is pretty unequivocal - it gives you the size of the screen and it gives you a timescale (the latter matching Apple&apos;s usual timescale for launching revisions of its computer-ish products, ie announce them in January (like it did with the iPad - remember? - and iPods). Which hasn&apos;t stopped some slightly excitable blogs declaring that the launch of &quot;iPad 2&quot; is &quot;imminent&quot; (here&apos;s the search; I did try it on Bing but couldn&apos;t get the same relevant set of results). Some are suggesting that Apple is going to try to knock out the smaller 7&quot; tablets that have begun appearing (such as the Samsung Galaxy Tab - read Tim Bray of Google&apos;s very fine review) by offering its own 7&quot; &quot;mini-iPad&quot;. A moment&apos;s thought will tell you that this is wrong. I&apos;m certain that Apple is not going to announce a 7&quot; iPad early next year.     The iPod mini, launched in January 2004. Remember that? Photograph: Martin Ruetschi/Keystone/Corbis    Here&apos;s why.  The tablet market is exploding; it&apos;s chewing into netbook sales and even, if you believe the numbers, notebook sales (at least in the US). There are all sorts of competing OSs (Techcrunch counts six OSs - Apple&apos;s iOS, Android, Chrome, Windows, WebOS, and the mysterious &quot;BlackPad&quot; for BlackBerry-ish devices.) Update: Make that 7 - as MagicianUK points out in the comments, there&apos;s going to be a MeeGo tablet launched (Germany only to begin with) next week. Oh my. There are also competing sizes - with Samsung having gained a lot of attention for the Galaxy Tab, which is a 7&quot; tablet. Other companies seem tempted to follow. Dell&apos;s got the 5&quot; Streak, Toshiba has a 10&quot; tablet, but 7&quot; is what quite a few companies are aiming at (including Viewsonic). Now ask yourself: if you were in marketing in Apple, would you launch a product which has a different screen size from the one you&apos;ve spent millions of dollars/pounds marketing, yet which has the same screen size as (some of) your competitors? Wouldn&apos;t doing that make it look like you think your rivals had the right idea about screen size, and that you screwed it up the first time? (Even if you did. But this is marketing, remember, where no decision is ever wrong.) Or would you stick with the same screen size that you&apos;ve already established, and perhaps increase the pixel density, and so make it something more like the iPhone 4&apos;s &quot;Retinal Display&quot;? That way the old and new models are the same size, so that retailers don&apos;t have to remake their in-store displays (much) and can also sell any remaining old stock they have without people asking too many difficult questions. Well? No-brainer. You stick with the existing size. Yes, you can point to the iPod mini, which was released in January 2004: before that, all iPods had been the same size (but with various feature tweaks). It was the iPod mini, a smaller version of the original iPod, which made the category take off: its sales were truly enormous, and that&apos;s what cemented Apple&apos;s leadership of the MP3 player market. But we&apos;re not yet at the same point in the product cycle of the iPad, or tablets, as the iPod mini was in the iPod cycle. Tablets are a category that has barely begun to make an impact on consumer consciousness; it&apos;s still unusual to see someone carrying one.  By contrast in January 2004, Apple had been running the iTunes Music Store for almost 9 months; by the summer of 2004 it had sold 100m songs, which implies that it was already well along the way before the iPod mini was launched. So what should you expect? - no revision of the iPad any time this year- another version of the iPad to be announced some time in the first quarter of next year, with the same screen size, probably with more storage, and possibly with greater resolution In the fullness of time - ie once a few of the would-be tablet makers have folded their tents and gone home, unable to make anything resembling a profit - it would make sense for Apple to try to corner the rest of the market by launching a smaller iPad, just as it did with the iPod. But even if that makes sense in the market, I don&apos;t expect to see that until 2012 at the earliest. Remember, the iPod was launched in October 2001; as a product line it was more than two years old by the time the iPod mini came along. The iPad hasn&apos;t even been in peoples&apos; hands for six months yet. Apple doesn&apos;t move that quickly. But there are plenty of blogs - and even newspapers - which like to let expectation run ahead of reality. Cooler heads prevail in Cupertino, though."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/19/supergroup-superdry-sales-shares-rise", "publicationDate": "2010-09-18T23:06:01Z", "tags": ["SuperGroup", "Retail industry", "Consumer spending", "Business", "Fashion"], "sentences": ["The retailer, which owns the Cult, Surf Co California and 77Breed brands as well as Superdry, has more openings planned between now and Christmas, including its first franchise in the Middle East, in Dubai, as well as department store concessions in Taiwan."], "title": "SuperGroup sales propel founder into the super-rich league", "article": "Next boss Lord Wolfson said last week that the boom years for retailers were over and sluggish growth would be the &quot;new normal&quot;.

When you are a static business every penny counts but we are growing ballistically.&quot; The Cheltenham-based group has turned out to be the flotation of the year with its shares more than doubling in value since it made its debut on the stock market in March. The company&apos;s market capitalisation is now approaching \u00a31bn, propelling Dunkerton \u2013 who smokes roll-up cigarettes and drives a diesel Range Rover Sport &quot;because it&apos;s cheaper to run&quot; \u2013 into the ranks of the UK&apos;s super-rich. His 33% stake in the company is worth \u00a3310m today, which is on top of the \u00a380m he banked at the time of the flotation. At the trading update Dunkerton, 45, says rivals should stop whinging about the economy. &quot;I have expanded this business through three recessions and I don&apos;t think trading conditions are any tougher now,&quot; he says. &quot;When you are accumulating market share you are in a way immune to the ailments of the wider world.&quot; He spent his early years in London but was 14 when his family decamped to Herefordshire after his father quit the BBC to pursue the good life making organic cider. He started out selling punk fashions from a market stall in Cheltenham in the early 80s with the help of \u00a340 a week from the Enterprise Allowance Scheme. SuperGroup now has 47 UK stores plus 56 concessions in department stores such as House of Fraser. The appeal of its &quot;urban cool&quot; look, which aims at 18-to-23-year-olds, seems universal. The stores never hold sales and all last-season ranges and seconds are unloaded through eBay \u2013 through what has become the auction website&apos;s biggest European store. The clothes are also wholesaled in 33 markets with the division posting growth of 54% in the three months to 1 August. Superdry has been helped along the way by the unofficial patronage of celebrities such as David Beckham, Leonardo DiCaprio and Helena Christensen. Indeed, it owes a lot to Beckham, who has become its unofficial poster boy; it hit the big time after the footballer was photographed wearing one of its now famous Brad leather jackets and a blue &quot;Osaka 6&quot; T-shirt \u2013 a design that references the Japanese influences of Dunkerton&apos;s business partner, designer James Holder. The retailer, which owns the Cult, Surf Co California and 77Breed brands as well as Superdry, has more openings planned between now and Christmas, including its first franchise in the Middle East, in Dubai, as well as department store concessions in Taiwan. Dunkerton says that the surge in the cotton price is a concern but that SuperGroup&apos;s exponential growth meant it would be able to negotiate better deals with suppliers that offer discounts on larger orders."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/sep/20/liberal-democrat-conference-live-monday", "publicationDate": "2010-09-20T07:44:04Z", "tags": ["Liberal Democrat conference 2010", "Liberal Democrat conference", "Liberal Democrats", "Politics"], "sentences": ["But his address in 1958, during an international security crisis over two obscure islands in the Taiwan Straits, is fondly remembered to this day."], "title": "Liberal Democrat conference  - Monday 20 September", "article": " 8.40am: This may be premature, and it probably won&apos;t go down well with some of the readers who post comments on this site, but I think it&apos;s true and so I&apos;ll say it anyway. The Lib Dem have been in Liverpool for two days and, from Nick Clegg&apos;s perspective, it has up until now all been going rather well. Journalists came to Merseyside looking for an anti-coalition revolt. (Journalists are always looking for a revolt; it&apos;s just what they do.) But \u2013 so far \u2013 the party has been pretty loyal. If the only rebels speaking out are people like David Rendel, Sandra Gidley and Evan Harris, Clegg does not have much to worry about. Today things could get a bit more tricky. The Lib Dems are debating a motion saying that they are &quot;concerned by the establishment of academies and free schools under coalition policy&quot;. This is probably David Cameron&apos;s most cherished proposed public sector reform. But, as my colleague Jeevan Vasagar reports, some Lib Dem activists hate it. The debate will illuminate the division between the leadership and the Lib Dem grassroots. But it will also show that there&apos;s still a difference between the Lib Dems and the Tories, which is a message that Clegg&apos;s party might find reassuring. Clegg himself will be delivering his leader&apos;s speech this afternoon. Here&apos;s a timetable. 9am: Conference opens with a debate on &quot;facing the future&quot;. 11am: Lib Dems debate the motion on free schools and academies. The vote will come at around 12.20pm. 1pm: Charles Kennedy, Chris Huhne and Labour&apos;s Lord Adonis debate the future of politics at a Guardian fringe. 2.30pm: Debate on green taxation. 4.15pm: Nick Clegg&apos;s speech. I&apos;ll be covering all these events, as well as bringing you breaking news, going through the papers and brining you the best conference comment from the web.  8.58am: The Lib Dems do not have any ethnic minority representatives in the House of Commons, the European parliament, the Scottish parliament or the Welsh assembly. At a fringe meeting last night Nick Clegg said that this was a source of &quot;great regret&quot; to him and that the party was in the &quot;last chance saloon&quot; when it came to improving its diversity.      I feel is is an inescapable duty on us as a party to be more diverse in the way we are represented ... I would like to say at this stage is that it is not a small technical matter, how we select our candidates, it is not dry, exotic corner of the procedural debates of the last day. It is absolutely fundamental to the kind of liberal, diverse party that we should be and that bluntly we are not. It is a source of genuine regret to me - and I share in this responsibility as much as anybody else - that we have a parliamentary party that is unrepresentative of modern Britain and that must change.  I have changed my own mind on this quite considerably: I was always quite hostile - for all the good reasons we have heard before - of interventionist ways of changing the representation of our party, even on a one-off basis. I think we are now really in the last chance saloon on this. On Wednesday the party will debate plans to ensure that there has to be at least one ethnic minority candidate on the shortlist when the party selects candidates in winnable seats. Clegg used to be opposed to measures of this kind, but now he has changed his mind.  9.19am: Lord Ashdown, the former Lib Dem leader, strongly defended Nick Clegg&apos;s decision to join a coalition with the Tories on the Today programme this morning.  Nick had the right judgment on this and I support him fully, completely and energetically ... If the Liberal Democrats had not gone into coalition, the consequences for the party would have been worse, the risk for our party would have been greater, the benefit for our country would have been fantastically diminished.  On the same programme Simon Hughes, the deputy party leader, said that motions passed at Lib Dem conference will influence government policy.  For the first time ever, motions passed at our conference are relevant in influencing our party in government ... We can stop things happening, because this is not a government where you have a second, smaller partner looking after a bit [of it] - this is a government where all the decisions are shared.   9.24am: Here&apos;s some more Lib Dem discontent. PoliticsHome (paywall) was listening to Bob Russell, the Colchester MP, on Radio 5 Live this morning. This is what he said.  I agreed to the coalition through gritted teeth. It was basically the only realistic option in the national interest and I&apos;m battling for the things I believe in.   9.44am: Last night the Lib Dems released some extracts from Clegg&apos;s speech. Here they are. On why he went into coalition with the Tories:  Some say we shouldn&apos;t have gone into government at a time when spending had to be cut. We should have let the Conservatives take the blame. Waited on the sidelines, ready to reap the political rewards. Maybe that&apos;s what people expected from a party that has been in opposition for 65 years. People have got used to us being outsiders, against every government that&apos;s come along. Maybe we got used to it ourselves. But the door to the change we want was opened, for the first time in most of our lifetimes. Imagine if we had turned away. How could we ever again have asked the voters to take us seriously?  On the future of the Lib Dems:  The Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives are and always will be separate parties, with distinct histories and different futures. But for this parliament we work together to fix the problems we face and put the country on a better path. This is the right government for right now.  That phrase &quot;and different futures&quot; is significant. It&apos;s Clegg&apos;s way of ruling out a merger. And here&apos;s Clegg on tax evasion:  We all agree it&apos;s wrong when people help themselves to benefits they shouldn&apos;t get. But when the richest people in the country dodge their tax bill that is just as bad. Both come down to stealing money from your neighbours. We will be tough on welfare cheats. But unlike Labour, we&apos;ll be tough on tax cheats too.   9.56am: We&apos;ve now got a new contender for the title of &quot;most outspoken Lib Dem rebel&quot;. Mike Hancock, the MP for Portsmouth South, is not at the conference. But he has given an interview to Peter Henley, the BBC&apos;s political reporter for the south of England, and he has told Henley that he has written a letter to Nick Clegg asking him to &quot;end the dictatorship&quot; of his ministers over the party. Hancock has also accused Clegg of &quot;abandoning a key aspect of Liberal Democrat policy&quot; by supporting plans for welfare cuts. This is what Hancock told the BBC:  I&apos;m already struggling myself on so many issues. At the moment I don&apos;t see the defining of policies clearly so that people understand. People have very long memories. I remember the Winter of Discontent - rubbish piling up in the street and the dead going unburied. I don&apos;t want to see us indiscriminately hack into benefits and the innocent suffer along with the guilty. We will have to work very, very hard indeed to convince people that the coalition is working and at the present time I don&apos;t think we&apos;re doing that successfully.  Hancock also said that holding the referendum on the alternative vote next May would be a big mistake.  One year after an election, having to make very painful decisions that are affecting the whole nation, this is the first time that people get to show their resentment at what&apos;s happened and you are asking them to change the voting system. I just think that it is a gift to our opponents and we will live to regret it.   10.35am: Michael Moore has resigned as deputy leader of the Scottish Lib Dems, the BBC reports, because he wants to concentrate on his job as Scottish secretary.  10.42am: You can read today&apos;s Guardian politics stories here. And the stories filed yesterday, including some that are in today&apos;s paper, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here are the Lib Dems articles that I thought were particularly worth noting. \u2022 Lord Rennard, the former Lib Dem chief executive, says in the Financial Times (subscription) that Nick Clegg needs to find policy areas to push that &quot;do not threaten the coalition agreement but allow him to show distinctiveness from both the other main parties&quot;.  Trident was a good &quot;wedge&quot; issue for the Liberal Democrats in the general election and it remains one today. Many Conservative voters are anxious about such large sums going to something of questionable value to the country&apos;s defences. Lib Dem opposition also scores well with traditional Labour supporters, who disapproved of the last Labour government&apos;s positioning of itself with Tory hawks. The Liberal Democrats did well in Scotland when they formed a coalition with Labour in 1999 by getting the credit for the abolition of student tuition fees. If a similar way can now be found to prevent students from poorer backgrounds deciding that they cannot afford to go to university, this would again be seen as a Lib Dem success. It is also something that Labour would find hard to oppose.  \u2022 Sam Coates and Roland Watson in the Times (paywall) say that Nick Clegg is going to ensure that prisoners get the right to vote.  Nick Clegg&apos;s officials said last night that the blanket ban on Britain&apos;s 88,000 prisoners taking part in elections cannot continue. The Deputy Prime Minister took responsibility for the issue from Kenneth Clarke, the Justice Secretary, in July. Britain is under pressure to act because of a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights and criticism from the Council of Europe. Prisoners are now being encouraged to sue the Government and receive up to \u00a3750 each in compensation. Mr Clegg&apos;s team is examining how far up the sentence scale to extend the new right. His spokeswoman said: &quot;There needs to be a change to the current situation in the light of the court cases but we don&apos;t support the blanket rights for prisoners to vote.&quot;  \u2022 Mary Ann Sieghart in the Independent says Clegg wields disproportionate influence over the government.  If, as leader of a minority party, you agree to run a department, you become too distracted to wield much influence over the rest of government policy. If you are Foreign Secretary, it&apos;s worse still, as you are out of the country for much of the time. Cameron kept offering Clegg jobs during the coalition negotiations, but Clegg knew that he didn&apos;t want a department of his own and refused even to discuss jobs for himself and his colleagues until the very end, after Gordon Brown resigned. He realised that it would be too easy to be bought off with Cabinet seats at the expense of Lib Dem policies. The outcome is that the leader of a party with only 57 parliamentary seats has disproportionate influence on government. Clegg played a relatively weak hand well and \u2013 if his party is patient \u2013 has a good chance of turning this Coalition to his advantage. It&apos;s too easy to make lazy predictions like &quot;the Coalition can&apos;t last&quot; or &quot;the Lib Dems will be subsumed.&quot; Politics have been transformed since May and we have to reassess our old prejudices. There is one glaring fact that the old Westminster lags have missed: the Coalition is likely to last the course because the only party that would gain from it being wrecked is Labour.  \u2022 The Daily Telegraph says the midddle classes could be subject to lie detector tests as part of Nick Clegg&apos;s plans for a clampdown on tax evasion. \u2022 And the The Daily Mail says Clegg has a two-pronged attack on the better-off yesterday, announcing a crackdown on tax avoidance and signalling the axe for middle class benefits.      Mike Hancock MP Photograph: Guardian    11.08am: Mike Hancock has posted the full text of his letter to Nick Clegg (pdf) (see 9.56am) on his website. As he explains in a website post, he believes that any government policy not covered by the coalition agreement should be subject to the party&apos;s &quot;triple lock&quot;. In other words, activists should effectively have a veto. Hancock says he voted against the VAT increase and the academies bill because they were not approved in this way. This meant they were unconstitutional, he suggests.  If Nick wants to change the party&apos;s constitution then he should bring forward the appropriate motions to conference, otherwise he should abide by it.  In his letter Hancock admits that leading the Lib Dems is like &quot;herding cats&quot; and he rules out defecting to Labour (saying that if Dennis Skinner could remain in New Labour, he will remain in the Lib Dems.) He says some warm things about Clegg&apos;s leadership. But he also attacks the government&apos;s welfare policies, and says that if Clegg thinks benefits are too high, he should try living on them for a month.  11.29am: The debate on free schools and academies has started. Peter Downes, a Lib Dem councillor who is moving the motion, has just finished proposing the motion expressing concern about the government&apos;s policies. He said that he was &quot;not seeking to rock the coalition boat&quot;. But he also wanted to make it clear that academies and free schools are &quot;incompatible with the basic principles of Liberal Democrat education policy&quot;. They are &quot;divisive, costly and unfair&quot;, he said. These plans &quot;are on the statute book and on the shelf&quot;, he said. &quot;That&apos;s where they should remain.&quot; Downes&apos;s motion calls on &quot;all Liberal Democrats to urge people not to take up [the free school or academy option]&quot;. Downes said that he was not calling for &quot;hysterical boycotts&quot;; he just wanted &quot;sensible debate&quot;. But if this motion goes through unamended, the Lib Dems as a party will be committed to encouraging people not to set up free schools and academies even though they voted for legislation making it easier for people to do just this. That is not entirely illogical. But it would take some explaining. A Lib Dem peer, Lady Walmsley, and an MP, Dan Rogerson, have tabled an amendment taking out the &quot;urge people not to take up this option&quot; clause. Instead, it talks about the Lib Dems noting &quot;the potential risks to local communities&quot; that free school and academies pose. If this amendment gets accepted, the motion (if it gets approved) will be marginally less embarrasing to the leadership. Downes has written a piece for Comment is Free explaining his argument in more detail.      Sarah Teather MP Photograph: Guardian    11.50am: Sarah Teather, the Lib Dem eduction minister, has just spoken. She said that she was opposed to the motion &quot;as drafted&quot; (ie, the original Downes version, without the amendment) and she urged delegates to vote against it. She did not make it particularly clear as to whether or not she would approve the motion if the main amendment were to go through. She told the conference that she was opposed to Downes&apos;s text because what he said about a boycott was &quot;fundamentally illiberal&quot;.  Councils have to be able to use every tool that is available to them to improve the life chances for their children. If the best way to solve a local problem is to work with the government of the day, this conference should not stand in their way. Please don&apos;t vote for a boycott. Don&apos;t tie our councillors&apos; hands. Please vote down the motion.   12.03pm: It&apos;s a lively debate. They have now opened it up to the floor, and we&apos;re getting speeches lasting one minute each. It seems fairly likely that the motion will go through. But it is very hard to tell whether the Walmsley/Rogerson amendment (see 11.29am) will go through.  (The Walmsley/Rogerson amendment is amendment two. There is another one, but it&apos;s less important.) Evan Harris, the former Lib Dem MP, spoke after Sarah Teather (see 11.50am) and he said he was &quot;astonished&quot; to hear her &quot;urge people not to take up this option&quot; as illiberal.  When is it illiberal for our party, determining policy independently, to call on Liberal Democrats to call on other people to do something that we agree with. That is what being in politics involves. It is not illegal. And it isn&apos;t even calling for a boycott. And that also wouldn&apos;t be illiberal. So lines 16 and 17 [ie, the original text] must stay if we are to support local campaigning.   12.05pm: The BBC is running a good Lib Dem conference live blog. They&apos;ve had a steer on something Nick Clegg is going to say in his speech this afternoon.  Nick Clegg is to outline new ways of councils raising money as an antidote to cuts, the BBC understands. In his keynote speech this afternoon he will announce a plan to allow councils to borrow against future projected income. This could theoretically release hundreds of millions of pounds of income for councils around the country. Gordon Brown always resisted this idea when he was at the Treasury.    12.14pm: Dan Rogerson, MP for North Cornwall, is winding up the debate. He says that his amendment (which takes out the &quot;urge people not to take up this option&quot; clause) would not stop Evan Harris campaigning for what he believes in.  12.29pm: The Lib Dem leadership has suffered a significant defeat. The Walmsley/Rogerson amendment has been &quot;clearly lost&quot;. And the main motion (plus another minor amendment, saying that the extension of free schools and academies would increase the amount of discrimination on religious grounds) has been carried overwhelmingly. This means that Nick Clegg now has to explain why his party is committed to campaigning against the expansion of academies, even though Lib Dem MPs voted for the legislation allowing this expansion to happen. Confused? That&apos;s democracy for you. At one level it is hugely embarrassing, because it makes the party look a bit daft. But it will have no effect on legislation that has already been passed and it is hard to know whether it will have any effect on the way academies and free schools are rolled out in the future. (It is conceivable that Michael Gove may decide to proceed a bit more cautiously because of this vote, but more likely that he will decide to take no notice.) On the plus side, Nick Clegg will be able to cite this as clear proof that the Lib Dems have not become a pale-blue offshoot of the Conservative party.      Danny Alexander told the Liberal Democrats' conference that the Treasury would be 'ruthless with wealthy individuals and business who think paying extra tax is an optional extra'. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    12.42pm: Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has told the BBC that the vote on free schools and academies will make no difference to government policy.       1.10pm: Here is a lunchtime summary. \u2022 Lib Dem activists have chosen to flex their muscles by voting overwhelmingly in favour of committing their party to campaigning against free schools and the extension of academies. This is an embarrassment for Nick Clegg and the party leadership. Delegates ignored Sarah Teather, the education minister, who told them that what they were voting for was &quot;fundamentally illiberal&quot; when she spoke in the debate. The vote will have little, if any, practical effect on government policy, but it means that the Lib Dems have been able to assert their identity and it will probably cheer the delegates immensely. \u2022 A Lib Dem MP has complained about the party leadership operating as a &quot;dictatorship&quot;. In an open letter to Nick Clegg, Mike Hancock also accused the deputy prime minister of acting in a way that was unconstitutional because the government has adopted policies that have not been approved by the party. (See 9.56am and 11.08am.) \u2022 Prison campaigners have welcomed the news that Clegg wants to give some prisoners the right to vote. He has made it clear that Britain will finally comply with a long-standing European court of human rights ruling saying that the ban on all prisoners is illegal. Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: &quot;Foot-dragging will no longer be tolerated by the Council of Europe which has given the coalition government just three months to comply with the outstanding court judgment and, at last, overturn the outdated and counterproductive ban on prisoners&apos; voting. (See 10.42am.)  1.24pm: I&apos;m at the Guardian fringe and, after a bit of struggle, I&apos;ve finally persuaded my laptop to talk to the internet. We&apos;re in a room the size of an aircraft hangar and it&apos;s packed. I suspect many people came to hear Charles Kennedy, but he has not been able attend. Chris Huhne and Lord Adonis are also on the panel (and they&apos;re here) and Jo Swinson is standing in for Kennedy.  Huhne opened with an entertaining blast at political correspondents, who, he said, were only surprised by the success of the Lib Dems because they were too innumerate to understand the psephological trends that have seen the third party vote steadily increasing over the last 40 years. He also dismissed the idea that being in coalition would end up with the Lib Dems being swallowed up by the Tories. Just look at Scotland, he said, where being in coalition didn&apos;t harm the Lib Dems. Adonis, who now heads the Institute for Government, said he did not accept Huhne&apos;s claim that liberalism was the only -ism still relevant. Social democracy is still going strong, he said.  1.42pm: Just having internet problems, but will post again as soon as possible. Sorry about this.  2.12pm: I&apos;ve bailed out of the fringe. My internet connection was about as reliable as Charles Kennedy. It was a shame, because it was getting quite spiky. One member of the audience asked Chris Huhne how Lib Dems could expect to win in the local elections next May with the spending cuts just coming in. Huhne said, essentially, that the Lib Dems were always good at campaigning locally and that they should not worry too much. One of the delegates sitting next to me declared, rather loudly, that Huhne was talking rubbish. In the meantime, I see that Sarah Teather has been responding to the conference vote. This is what she said.  The motion restates existing party policy. The Liberal Democrats are an open and democratic party and it is right the members should express their views on government policy. Our members respect that in a coalition government, some of the policies that go forward will be Conservative ones and some will be Liberal Democrat ones and some will be a blend of the two. Compromise is inevitable and healthy. As well as free schools and academies, the government is introducing a pupil premium to give extra funding to schools taking the poorest pupils, a key Lib Dem manifesto commitment.       Ed Balls, the shadow schools secretary: 'Once again we have clear evidence that the victims of the ... unfair and economically dangerous cuts are the poorest and those in most need.' Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA    2.17pm: Ed Balls has put out a statement about the Lib Dem education vote.  This is another blow for the coalition&apos;s unpopular, flawed and deeply unfair school reforms. Lib Dem members have said loud and clear that they won&apos;t be fooled by hollow rhetoric from either Nick Clegg or Michael Gove. While Lib Dem Ministers claim to have secured a pupil premium to compensate for the worst effects of the coalition&apos;s school reforms, they have absolutely nothing to show for it. It is not backed by any new funding and schools funding has not been protected from cuts, in direct contradiction to what David Laws claimed in the coalition talks with Labour a few days after the election.   2.26pm: I&apos;m just off to a briefing. I&apos;ll post when I&apos;m back.  3.10pm: This is fun. YouGov have been polling Lib Dem members and they&apos;ve found that Lib Dem members have a higher opinion of David Cameron than Simon Hughes!  3.20pm: The Lib Dems are debating green taxes at the moment. I haven&apos;t been paying attention, but my colleague James Randerson is on the case. He&apos;s sent me this.     Deputy head of environment and editor of environmentguardian.co.uk  James Randerson Illustration: Christian Sinibaldi    Conference is talking about green taxation and there is palpable excitement that their man (Chris Huhne) is in the hot seat at the Department of Energy and Climate Change. This motion is all about party members making sure that the coalition comes good on the Lib Dems&apos; green policies (their manifesto went further than the three main parties before the election). Moving the motion, Paul Chambers said that David Cameron&apos;s ambition to lead the &quot;greenest government ever&quot; was arguably &quot;not much of a challenge&quot;. But he said that Lib Dem members would be looking for a &quot;step-change&quot; in green policy. The motion is a bundle of green measures - including a floor price for carbon and taxing planes ratherthan air passengers - that have mostly long been Lib Dem policy. But the party&apos;s green spokesperson in the European parliament, Chris Davies, pointed out the dangers of trying to be green while at the same time cutting spending.  &quot;We have a common enemy, not the Labour party, not the media, something much much worse - it&apos;s called the Treasury.&quot;  He said that the chancellor&apos;s department, although full of brilliant people, &quot;too often seem to see the price of everything but the value of nothing&quot;. The danger was that &quot;ministers&apos; strong green pledges would be turned into weak aspirations&quot;. To laughter in the conference hall he cautioned that Yes Minister was not a comedy programme but a training film for new ministers and urged the conference to &quot;send a message to the treasury - hands off our environmental commitments&quot;. It remains to be seen whether the Treasury is listening.  3.33pm: Jeremy Browne, a Lib Dem Foreign Office minister, told a fringe meeting at lunchtime that the coalition would survive if the public voted against the alternative vote in referendum.  I don&apos;t think the outcome of the referendum is [a deal-breaker]. You know, we have an opportunity to make the case for AV, I think the case is very compelling. If people don&apos;t vote for it, we get on with life, it&apos;s not the only issue in the world.   3.34pm: Nick Clegg&apos;s wife, Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, was turned away from the conference centre because she forgot her pass, the BBC reports.  4.12pm: Nick Clegg is due to stand up in about five minutes. As soon as he gets to his feet, I&apos;ll be able to post the highlights from the speech. In the conference hall Lady Scott, the outgoing party president, has just finished handing out party awards.  4.16pm: Nick Clegg has just started speaking, but I can post the highlights now because we&apos;ve already been given the text. There&apos;s not much new in policy terms in. The only announcement relates to local government finance, and even Clegg himself admits that it&apos;s a bit boring. But the political messages are strong, and some of the language is the best I&apos;ve heard from Clegg. Here are the main points.  \u2022 Clegg is telling his party \u2013 and his country \u2013 to be patient because Britain will be a better place in 2015. &quot;Stick with us and together we will change Britain for good,&quot; he said.  I believe at times of great difficulty, great things can still be done. At times of great difficulty, great things must be done.   \u2022 He is annoucing that councils will be given more power to borrow money. The government will let them borrow money, using the extra revenue that they are going to receive because the government is going to allow them to keep some extra business rates as security. Aides have not been able to tell us how much money this will actually generate.  \u2022 He defends the government&apos;s academy programme. Responding to this morning&apos;s vote against the academy programme, he says:  I want to be really clear about what the government is proposing. It&apos;s not Labour&apos;s academies programme: a few schools singled out for preferential treatment - a cuckoo in the nest that eats up attention and resources. We&apos;re opening up the option of Academy freedom to all schools \u2026 My vision is that every school, in time, will be equal, every school equally free.   \u2022 He insists that the government will not impose cuts in the way that Margaret Thatcher did. &quot;It will not be like the 80s,&quot; he says. &quot;We will make these cuts as fairly as possible.&quot;He also says that, even after all the cuts have been implemented, government spending will still be 41% of national income \u2013 the level it was in 2006.  The spending review is about balance and responsibility not slash and burn.  \u2022 He insists that he is strongly committed to devolving power. &quot;It is not smaller government I believe in. It&apos;s a different kind of government: a liberating government,&quot; he says. Councils may have less money. But they will be given &quot;more freedom than ever before.&quot; \u2022 He strongly defends coaltion government. &quot;Two parties acting together can be braver, fairer and bolder than one party acting along,&quot; he says. \u2022 And he criticises Labour for having nothing to say about tackling the deficit. &quot;We had 100,000 ideas from members of the public about how to cut waste and do things more effectively. And not a single idea from the Labour Party.,&quot; he says. Finally, it&apos;s a bit light on jokes. Very light, in fact. But there is one that works.  Has anyone else lost track of the books Labour people keep publishing? Never in the field of political memoirs, has so much been written by so few about so little. They went from nationalisation to serialisation. From The Third Way to a third off at the book shop.   4.23pm: Clegg said that some things are the same as before the election, and some are different.  I still think the war in Iraq was illegal. The difference is lawyers now get anxious when I mention it.  That was intended as a joke, although I think it&apos;s the first time he has said that government lawyers got twitchy when he made his statement about the war being illegal at the dispatch box. Now - amazingly - the government does not actually have a position on whether or not the war was legal.  4.25pm: The Treasury has just issued a press notice about the new borrowing powers for councils that Clegg is announcing. It&apos;s called tax increment financing. &apos;This may not make the pulses race,&apos; as Clegg says in his speech. Too right.  4.31pm: Clegg has just finished a passage about debt. &quot;Would you ask your children to pay your credit card bill?&quot; he asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; replied a colleague in the press room.  4.39pm: Clegg has repeated the message that he and Danny Alexander gave at the weekend about cracking down on tax evasion.  We all agree it&apos;s wrong when people help themselves to benefits they shouldn&apos;t get. But when the richest people in the country dodge their tax bills that is just as bad. Both come down to stealing money from your neighbours.    4.46pm: Clegg has just made the announcement about tax increment financing. (See 4.25pm.) It got a rather good reception. Many people who come to party conferences are councillors and, although the public at large isn&apos;t very interested in local government finance, audiences like this are.  4.47pm: Clegg has just delivered his joke about the Labour memoirs. &quot;From nationalisation to serialisation&quot; got a laugh. But his line about &quot;so much written by so few about so little&quot; is a classic example of someone including a line because it sounds good, even though it&apos;s not true. The Mandelson and Blair books actually cover rather a lot.  4.51pm: The full text of Clegg&apos;s speech is now on the Lib Dem website.  5.03pm: Clegg is getting towards the end. He has just taken a swipe at the broadcast the Tories produced before the election saying a hung parliament would be a disaster.  Never again will anyone be able to frighten the voters by claiming that coalition government doesn&apos;t work.       Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrat Party, begins his speech at his party's conference in Liverpool Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters    5.04pm: The speech is over. I&apos;m still trying to work out whether Clegg delivered a speech in which the only announcement was something arcane called tax increment financing because he hasn&apos;t got a clue about what interests the media (can you imagine Andy Coulson ever allowing that to be the main story in a David Cameron speech) or whether it was because the Lib Dems wanted to make a point about how serious, responsible and gimmick-resistant they really are. Clegg had a standing ovation lasting three minutes.  5.06pm: The first reaction to Nick Clegg&apos;s speech comes from the RMT&apos;s Bob Crow. It&apos;s a bit predictable - sorry, very predictable - but here it is anyway.  The Liberals went into the election promising one thing and then sold out their principles the minute the Tories offered them a sniff of power. The Liberals have become nothing less than the outriders for the most reactionary and right wing government in a generation and they can expect one almighty kicking from the voters when the time comes.   5.08pm: Earlier the conference passed a motion calling for 10% of government revenue to come from green taxes by 2015. Chris Huhne, the energy secretary, backed the motion.  5.20pm: Labour&apos;s Liam Byrne has put out a statement about the new borrowing powers announced for councils:  Labour pioneered new borrowing freedoms for councils in our March budget. But all the freedom in the world, I&apos;m afraid, won&apos;t make up for Tory budget cuts that are so fast and so deep that communities across our country will be scarred with higher unemployment. Nor do they excuse the Lib Dems cheering on an economic plan that punishes the poorest in our society.   5.47pm: Here&apos;s an afternoon reading list. \u2022 Will Straw at Left Foot Forward says that in his speech Nick Clegg used an analogy pioneered by Margaret Thatcher when he explained why the deficit had to be cut. Straw says Clegg and Thatcher were both wrong. \u2022 Iain Martin at his Wall Street Journal blog says Nick Clegg received a surprisingly downbeat reaction.   In any other party [being in government] would have earned Clegg a hero&apos;s reception from his own conference. But this isn&apos;t any other party. It&apos;s the Liberal Democrats. So they seemed a bit bemused during his speech, applauding politely and only really getting into it when he threw them some left-wing read meat (such as his &quot;daring&quot; attack on bankers).   \u2022 The Daily Telegraph lists numbers 50 to 26 in their list of most influential Lib Dems. \u2022 Mark Pack at Lib Dem Voice gives his assessment of the conference so far.   So overall? Conference pretty calm, with a general mood of desire to see coalition succeed but thinking that more Liberal Democrat policies need to be delivered for that to be the case.   \u2022 Alex Barker at the Financial Times&apos;s Westminster blog lists his top 10 Liberal conference moments. My favourite is from 1958:   Sir Alan Comyns Carr was a conference chairman with a disconcerting habit of keeping his notes between his mouth and his microphone. But his address in 1958, during an international security crisis over two obscure islands in the Taiwan Straits, is fondly remembered to this day. &apos;Fellow Liberals,&apos; he declared. &apos;The eyes of the world are on us \u2013 I do not want to say anything which might exacerbate the situation in Quemoy and Matsu.&apos;   5.56pm: Lady Eaton, head of the Local Government Association, has welcomed the announcement about council borrowing.  It is good news the government has listened to the calls from local government for the power to turn local tax revenue into investment that will keep our roads free from potholes, fund better public transport and make sure schools and community centres do not crumble.   6.21pm: There is quite a lot of reaction to the speech on the wires now from Lib Dem MPs, but it&apos;s all predictably laudatory \u2013 eg, &quot;inspirational&quot;, says Solihull MP Lorely Burt \u2013 and so I&apos;ll spare you from reading any more. I&apos;m about to finish, but, before I go, here&apos;s an  afternoon summary. \u2022 Nick Clegg told his party \u2013 and his country \u2013 to trust the coalition. In his conference speech, the deputy prime minister said that the years ahead would &quot;not be easy&quot;, but the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives would &quot;change Britain for good&quot;. It was an earnest, defensive speech, thin on jokes and containing just one announcement, a technical one relating to local government finance. But the tone may be appropriate to the times and, with the rhetoric toned down, Clegg was able to ensure that his audience focused on his argument, which was about the perils of debt, the virtues of coaltion and the attractions of decentralisation. He received a reception that was warm but certainly not ecstatic. (See 4.16pm) \u2022 Lib Dem ministers have shrugged off their defeat in a motion on academies and free schools this morning. Sarah Teather, an education minister, said that the government would &quot;take into account the things that are said&quot; but that the vote would not change coaliton policy. Clegg said that in time he wanted every school to be&quot;equally free&quot;. \u2022 The Lib Dems passed a motion saying that 10% of the government&apos;s revenue should be coming from green taxes by 2015. The full text of the motion is here. That&apos;s it for today.

Is Moscow better than Sydney? Would Hong Kong squeeze in above Manchester? Or Bangkok above Brighton? It would be a nonsensical exercise. Better in what respect? They are all vastly different types of human settlement, meeting different aspects of human need in different cultures and climates. True, there would be no shortage of data, though it would be of variable robustness and gathered on different bases in different countries. We could compare expenditure on public transport, or the area of open space, or unemployment. But to come to a single ranking, we would then have to manipulate the data: should a measure of the state of public health outweigh a measure of investment in public transport? Exactly the same problems arise with world rankings of universities. Each time a new set is published, universities shoot up or down the league tables, and vice-chancellors the world over engage in their traditional exercise of deploy (if up) or deplore (otherwise). But, in the real world, nothing has changed. The relative strengths of UK universities vis-a-vis their international peers vary only marginally and incrementally year on year. All that has changed is that the league table compilers have adopted new metrics and applied new weightings to them, but they still fall miles short of capturing anything like the variety, the dynamism and the diversity of the modern university. The basic problem is that there is no definition of the ideal university. Is it big or small? Is it better at research or at teaching? Is it a specialist science and technology institution with heavy research income \u2013 or does it focus primarily on the humanities and social sciences? Is it adventurous or risk averse? Next, what are the data? On teaching, there are simply no robust data on which global comparison can be made. Some tables rely on curious proxies, such as the number of PhDs awarded per academic, the number of undergraduates admitted per academic and the income per academic. None of these say anything about the quality of teaching. We might expect measures of research excellence to be robust, because top research is a globalised activity. Yet we would be disappointed. Take research income. There is a world of difference between scientific and medical institutions \u2013 where research is expensive and grants tend to be large \u2013 and other types of institution. This helps to explain why a world-class institution such as the London School of Economics can be ranked in one table no higher than 86th. What&apos;s more, research income is an input measure, and will tend to be higher in countries investing seriously in research. It does not speak to the quality of output, where UK universities have consistently demonstrated outstanding return on investment. Research citations can be a measure of quality, but need to be intelligently applied. There are big cultural variations between disciplines, and citation indices are not well attuned to capturing research excellence in the humanities, arts and social sciences. This isn&apos;t easy territory. Get it wrong and you end up with some truly bizarre results. For example, one of the recent sets of rankings concludes that Egypt&apos;s Alexandria University trumps both Stanford and Harvard for their influential research measured by impact. Global rankings have afforded annual light entertainment, but they are now seriously overreaching themselves. They do a disservice if they influence student choice, or come to be treated as a performance measure by the leaders of hugely diverse institutions. \u2022 Malcolm Grant is president and provost of UCL, which in current world rankings is variously placed at 4 (QS), 13 (Global Universities Ranking), 17 (Taiwan index), 21 (Shanghai Jiao Tong), 22 (THE) or 81 (4iCU)"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/21/vietnam-ivory-trade-asian-elephants", "publicationDate": "2010-09-21T13:44:00Z", "tags": ["Vietnam", "Conservation", "Endangered species", "Wildlife", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The country has quickly shifted from a transit point in the wildlife trade to a major end-consumer, now rivalling the richer Asian markets of Taiwan, South Korea, China and Japan."], "title": "Ivory trade could make Vietnam's elephants extinct within a decade", "article": "Huong&apos;s dank shop provides some brief respite from the waves of horn-blaring luxury SUVs bullying pedestrians on the pavements of Hanoi.

And, like those of the SUV-driving government officials cashing in on foreign investor paranoia about missing out on &quot;the next little China&quot; \u2013 Artcen&apos;s coffers are swelling. &quot;A few years ago, our customers were all Japanese, Chinese and Korean. But we get rich fast now too, and rich people always want to show what they have,&quot; says Huong, indicating a fashion that is likely to further endanger the slow-reproducing mammal. The wild elephant population has plummeted from more than 2,000 in the mid-90s to between 72-80 animals at liberty today, according to Vietnam&apos;s ministry of natural resources and environment. A large number of them have succumbed to illegal logging, agricultural encroachment and landmines left over from what Vietnamese call &quot;the American war&quot;. However, it is clear that over the last decade, most of Vietnam&apos;s wild herd has fallen victim to the rifle. Increased poaching in one of south-east Asia&apos;s fastest-growing economies has ignited fears that the once-revered animal will disappear from the jungles within a generation if conservation efforts are not stepped up soon. &quot;Most of our small pieces are locally sourced,&quot; admits Huong as she hands me crudely made Buddha and Jesus icons to inspect. &quot;Our prices are already too high, so we don&apos;t want to pay off more customs to bring it in from Laos or Cambodia.&quot; Her comments underscore another dark layer in Vietnam&apos;s march to economic development. The country has quickly shifted from a transit point in the wildlife trade to a major end-consumer, now rivalling the richer Asian markets of Taiwan, South Korea, China and Japan. Conservation group Traffic estimates that 4,000 tonnes of illegal wildlife products pass through Vietnam every year. Surging consumer demand means poaching is also spreading to forests in neighbouring Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Burma. &quot;It&apos;s also moving into new technology,&quot; says wildlife conservationist Duac Fegot. &quot;We&apos;re starting to see more avenues for trade in endangered wildlife in Vietnam emerge on the internet.&quot; &quot;The situation is becoming very critical and serious,&quot; says Huynh Tien Dung, World Wildlife Fund Vietnam&apos;s national policy co-ordinator. &quot;If the right efforts are spent, it is possible to bring the wild elephants back from the brink. If international donors give more priority to elephants, we are sure that it will help.&quot; Blaming the lack of donor funding may seem disingenuous given the amount of aid pouring into Vietnam for environmental programmes and strategies. Yet the real problem could well be that wildlife protection laws in Vietnam are toothless. Hanoi officially banned ivory sales in 1992 when it ratified the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. But a loophole was left, allowing for ivory traders to sell stock purchased before the treaty was ratified. Analysts say the loophole is a veiled nod to the continuation of poaching and smuggling. &quot;These pieces we have on display are all new and would be even more expensive if they dated to before 1992,&quot; says Huong. &quot;But we still say they&apos;re from before then.&quot; To the ongoing irritation of conservationists, traders and their inventories are never monitored. &quot;The two things that are causing the problems are: weak law enforcement and low awareness of the poor communities on protection of wild elephants,&quot; Huynh says. However, according to conservationists, the cost of street-level ivory \u2013 Traffic says tusks are selling for up to $1,500 a kg and cut pieces for up to $1,863 a kg \u2013 have encouraged law enforcement agents to seize consignments rather than attempt to halt poaching in the first place. Authorities recently seized 30 elephant tusks and 15 elephant tusk segments that were being transported to the northern province of M\u00f3ng C\u00e1i on the Chinese border. And last year, a container of tusks shipped from Tanzania to Vietnam \u2013 its contents worth millions of dollars \u2013 was &quot;confiscated&quot; by the government. But no charges have been brought and the whereabouts of the ivory is unknown. Nevertheless, the ministry of environment says it is trying to crack down on traders such as Huong, and claim a &quot;master plan&quot; is in the offing. It remains to be seen if this measure will prevent the extinction of the Asian elephant in the wild."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/24/silver-cross-pram-winning-pushy-mums", "publicationDate": "2010-09-24T18:47:56Z", "tags": ["Manufacturing sector", "Business", "Childcare", "Children", "Money", "Life and style", "UK news"], "sentences": ["&quot;We&apos;ve got to be the same today.&quot; To that end his son Ben, who has joined him in the business, is currently setting up Silver Cross Pacific to develop sales in countries such as Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand and China."], "title": "Silver Cross: the British pram winning over pushy mums", "article": "Alan Halsall has two passions: racehorses and Silver Cross, the 133-year-old Yorkshire pram-maker he saved from the scrapheap. One investment is going better than the other: his beloved Palypso De Creek didn&apos;t cross the finish line of this year&apos;s Grand National. Silver Cross, on the other hand, could have the makings of a champion. The company is winning over a new generation of mothers in the UK and in developed and developing markets such as the US and China. It was a close run thing though. After surviving more than 120 years of social and industrial change the company hit the buffers in 2002 with Halsall able to buy the former market-leader for only \u00a3500,000: &quot;When I bought Silver Cross, it was regarded as a heritage brand; very old-fashioned and a bit quaint compared to companies like Bugaboo and Mamas and Papas.&quot; Silver Cross had missed opportunities: in the 1960s it turned down Owen Maclaren&apos;s first pushchair design \u2013 and had increasingly become an anachronism as nimble new entrants, such as what was to become Maclaren and Mamas and Papas, began making and importing cheaper, lightweight products for the rapidly changing Britain of the 1970s and early 1980s. But in Halsall&apos;s hands Silver Cross sales have gone from zero back up to 180,000 units in 2009. The business is profitable again and is expected to turn over \u00a320m this year. &quot;We had to be loyal to the tradition of great British design but also innovative and a little bit clever,&quot; he says of his efforts to rebuild the company. A lot remains the same. The classic coach prams (pictured) in its premium &quot;Heritage&quot; range, such as the Balmoral and the Kensington, are still the stuff of Mary Poppins, with their hand-sprung chassis, rose metalwork and elegantly curved handles once again in demand by the rich and famous. In previous decades the glamour of the brand radiated from famous clients such as the British royal family and Grace Kelly, who was photographed for a magazine shoot in the late 1950s pushing Princess Caroline in one of its prams. Celebrity culture has played a part in its renaissance \u2013 although this time the unlikely supporters include Britney Spears, P Diddy and Liverpool&apos;s Steven Gerrard. If the price tag doesn&apos;t put you off \u2013 the Balmoral costs \u00a31,100 \u2013 you&apos;d also struggle to get round Tesco with one. &quot;They are impractical,&quot; agrees Halsall. &quot;They don&apos;t fit in a car, but that&apos;s not the point. You don&apos;t buy one for practical reasons, you buy one because you appreciate its beauty.&quot; You are also unlikely to see them on eBay, Halsall says, as owners struggle to part with them \u2013 he has one in his garage. &quot;My wife won&apos;t let it go and that is typical of a lot of people who buy them.&quot; Today the Heritage range is 5% of sales: it has tackled the mass market head on with a large product range that starts at \u00a3100 and includes car seats and buggies, albeit not made at its factory in Bingley, West Yorkshire, (below) and it is holding its own in a competitive and increasingly hi-tech market. The company, named after a street in what was an industrial suburb of Leeds, has also embraced the mumsnet generation via Facebook and Twitter. &quot;In 1877, when Silver Cross was established, it was incredibly innovative,&quot; says Halsall, whose family&apos;s toy business had previously made Silver Cross dolls&apos; prams under licence. &quot;We&apos;ve got to be the same today.&quot; To that end his son Ben, who has joined him in the business, is currently setting up Silver Cross Pacific to develop sales in countries such as Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand and China. Mindful of the precarious situation Silver Cross has faced in the past Halsall, who owns the company outright, is financing the expansion himself. &quot;I don&apos;t like debt and I don&apos;t like banks,&quot; says the Lancastrian businessman. Halsall \u2013 who was so passionate about the need for a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty he ran a campaign in the north west \u2013 is a fan of David Cameron&apos;s &quot;big society&quot;. He founded the Skipton and Ripon enterprise mentoring service to help other entrepreneurs. &quot;I&apos;m a baby boomer, we really had it very good so it&apos;s time to give something back.&quot; The next step, says Halsall, is a Heritage &quot;Classics&quot; range and he is seeking other British manufacturers making complementary products such as nursery furniture or toys that it could lend its name to. He says China presents the biggest prize for the company and it has already exported its first Heritage pram to a couple living in Chengdu, the capital of the Sichuan province. Given that its prams are famous for their suspension it seems right that Silver Cross should survive a bumpy ride. As for Palypso De Creek he will have another crack at the Grand National next year. &quot;In racing, hope springs eternal,&quot; says Halsall."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/sep/28/north-korea-kim-jong-il-succession", "publicationDate": "2010-09-28T20:30:01Z", "tags": ["North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "South Korea", "China", "US foreign policy", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["In return for a delinking from North Korea, the South let it be known that it was prepared to consider negotiating a free trade agreement with China, as well as recognising China&apos;s claims over Taiwan and Tibet."], "title": "A family full of intrigue | Mark Seddon", "article": "Never mind the family drama surrounding the Miliband brothers in Manchester \u2013 there is another, less fraternal one under way in Pyongyang, at the conference of the Korean Workers Party, whose outcome arguably has more important ramifications for world, not just family, peace. The North&apos;s capital has been on &quot;special alert&quot; for most of September, with more troop movements and orchestrated mass demonstrations than usual. The runup to the conference has been marked by factional discord over the promotion to general of the Dear Leader&apos;s third son and likely successor, 27-year-old Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-il&apos;s formidable brother-in-law and central committee member, Chang Song-taek, has been less than happy at this, and has been busy throwing spanners in the works. In other circumstances Chang might expect to be purged, but Kim Jong-il is said to regard him with awe and fear. There are reports that Kim Jong-un accompanied his father on a recent visit to China \u2013 which, if true, confirm that the succession has China&apos;s approval. But since few people know what he looks like, the story is difficult to verify. Into this maelstrom of family intrigue should also be factored the increasingly erratic behaviour of Kim Jong-il himself. From recent botched currency reforms to the sinking of the South Korean military vessel, Cheonan, it has become difficult to second-guess what is going on in his head. In recent weeks, perhaps contemplating the approaching food shortages, the North has offered &quot;military talks&quot; with the South over border issues. But again, Kim Jong-il visiting China may have played a part in this change. Because, despite continuing economic decline, the North Korean regime now finds itself in a comparatively secure position as it reshuffles its aged leadership: it has China on its side. South Korea&apos;s charm offensive, aimed at detaching China from its historic support for the North, appears to have misfired. South Korea&apos;s president Lee Myung-bak famously broke with his predecessors and took a much harder line towards Pyongyang. Coupled with tougher sanctions and a cessation of much of the aid to the North, behind the scenes the South Korean government has offered an extraordinary deal to the Chinese. In return for a delinking from North Korea, the South let it be known that it was prepared to consider negotiating a free trade agreement with China, as well as recognising China&apos;s claims over Taiwan and Tibet. Not that Lee is leaving anything to chance. While claims of North Korea&apos;s demise have proved premature, a leap from 68-year-old Kim Jong-il to Kim Jong-un throws up as many possibilities as it does problems. Lee has recently instituted a special &quot;reunification tax&quot; after findings from the Federation of Korean Industries put a price on reunification at\u00a0a cool $3 trillion. The relationship between China and North Korea seems not only to be holding up but getting stronger. At one level the North still provides a valuable buffer; on another it&apos;s a useful piece of real estate with which to trade on the international stage. There are other reasons: the Chinese are not prepared to countenance a unified Korea\u00a0that might one day see the US military patrolling its Yalu river border with the North. The succession of Kim Jong-un is a work in progress \u2013 but should he fail, the military will not stand idly by. If the succession plans unravel, the armed forces will reassert themselves. Meanwhile the shift in Pyongyang throws up opportunities to the US and its allies. Should they encourage the Chinese to help North Korea out of isolation or probe for weaknesses? The North has always demanded direct talks with the US in order to reach a final peace agreement over the Korean war. The US could consider this radical approach with a new leadership as a means to ending North Korea&apos;s nuclear programme. Toughing it out with the North hasn&apos;t\u00a0worked in the past \u2013 and has less chance of working in the future, as China emerges as a great superpower. In the end the family affair that is the Kim dynasty in North Korea is probably a problem for a bigger family to sort out \u2013 the Asian family."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/leeds/2010/sep/30/bookmarked-leeds-facebook-page-targets-east-asia-audience", "publicationDate": "2010-09-30T13:29:06Z", "tags": [], "sentences": ["Thousands of Facebook fans in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China are following the latest in Leeds life, fashion and trends, thanks to the efforts of a Leeds woman."], "title": "Bookmarked: Bookmarked: Leeds Facebook page attracts international audience", "article": "Thousands of Facebook fans in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China are following the latest in Leeds life, fashion and trends, thanks to the efforts of a Leeds woman.

Yet the commitment of governments to keep markets open was based on the belief that recovery would be swift and sustained. If, as many now suspect, the global economy is stuck in a low-growth, high-unemployment rut, the pressures for protectionism will grow. The former chancellor, Ken Clarke, aptly summed up the downbeat mood when he said in yesterday&apos;s Observer that it was hard to be &quot;sunnily optimistic&quot; about the west&apos;s economic prospects. Adam Posen, a member of the Bank of England&apos;s monetary policy committee, made a similar point last week in a speech last week advocating more quantitative easing. Despite a colossal stimulus, the recovery has been short-lived and, by historic standards, feeble. The traditional tools \u2013 cutting interest rates and spending more public money \u2013 were not enough, so have had to be supplemented by the creation of electronic money. In both the US and the UK, policymakers are actively canvassing the idea that more QE will be required, even though they well understand its drawbacks and limitations. There is the sense of finance ministries and central banks running out of options. They can&apos;t cut interest rates any further; there is strong resistance from both markets and voters to further fiscal stimulus, and so far QE has had a more discernible effect on asset prices than it has on the real economy. The reason for that is that the money created by allowing commercial banks to sell bonds has tended to be used for speculative purposes rather than lent to businesses and individuals. So what&apos;s left? The answer is that countries can try to give themselves an edge by manipulating their currencies, or they can go the whole hog and put up trade barriers. It is a sign of the etiolated nature of the recovery that both options are currently &quot;in play&quot;. Guido Mantega, Brazil&apos;s finance minister, warned that an &quot;international currency war&quot; has broken out following the recent moves by Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to intervene directly in the foreign exchange markets. China has long been criticised by other nations, the US in particular, for building up massive trade surpluses by holding down the level of its currency, the renminbi. It is not difficult to see why individual nations are pursuing this strategy. The lesson from the 1930s is that those countries that devalue their currencies early steal a march on their rivals. So Britain, the first nation to come off the gold standard in September 1931, recovered more quickly than France, which stuck it out to the bitter end. A second lesson, of course, is that for the global economy as a whole, competitive devaluations represent a zero-sum game, since for every currency that depreciates there has to be a currency that appreciates. As things stand, the currencies that are under most upward pressure are the Japanese yen and the euro. Why? Because the Chinese have all but pegged the renminbi to a US dollar that has been weakened by the prospect of more QE over the coming months. But currency intervention is one thing, full-on protectionism another. The existence of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), with its strict rules for what is permissible and sanctions for countries that transgress, has made it more difficult to indiscriminately slap tariffs on imports. What&apos;s more, there is still a strong attachment to the concept of free trade; it is the one piece of the so-called Washington consensus that has survived the crisis. Policymakers still recoil in horror at mention of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, introduced in the US in 1930 and blamed for turning the Wall Street Crash into the Great Depression. Paul Krugman has shown that the collapse in US production could not have been caused by protectionism, but the myth that the slump was caused by a trade war is an enduring one. The most that could be said is that beggar-my-neighbour policies eventually added to the problems caused by ill-conceived monetary and fiscal policies: the failure to cut interest rates quickly enough, the failure to keep credit flowing, the failure in the US to keep banks in business and the insistence on running balanced budgets. In Britain, protectionism in the form of &quot;imperial preference&quot; \u2013 for goods from within what we would now know as the commonwealth \u2013 was one of the three factors that helped the economy recover after 1931: devaluation and cheap money were the other two. The question now is whether the commitment to free trade is as deep as it seems. The round of trade liberalisation talks started in Doha almost nine years ago remain in deep freeze. Repeated attempts to conclude the talks have run into the same problem: trade ministers talk like free traders but they act like mercantilists, seeking to extract the maximum amount of concessions for their exporters while giving away as little as possible in terms of access to their own domestic markets. The approach taken by countries at the WTO talks also governs their thinking when it comes to steering their countries out of trouble. There are plenty of nations extolling the virtues of export-led growth, but very few who are keen on boosting their domestic demand so that those exports can find willing buyers. The global imbalances between those countries running trade surpluses and those running trade deficits are almost as pronounced as they were before the crisis, and are getting wider. This is a recipe for tension, especially between Beijing and Washington. This tension manifested itself last week when the House of Representatives passed a bill that would allow US companies to apply for duties to be put on imports from countries where the government actively weakened the currency \u2013 ie China. The Senate will debate its version of the same bill after the November mid-term elections, but it was interesting that the House bill was passed by a big majority and with considerable bipartisan support. China responded swiftly and testily to the developments on Capitol Hill, arguing that the move would contravene WTO rules and quite deliberately tweaking its currency lower. It&apos;s not hard to see why Beijing got the hump. It introduced the biggest fiscal stimulus (in relation to GDP) of any country and helped lift the global economy out of its trough. It can only fulfil its domestic policy goal of alleviating poverty if it can shift large numbers of people out of the fields and into the factories, and that requires a cheap currency. It has been financing the US twin deficits. Unsurprisingly, then, its message to the Americans was clear: it&apos;s not smart to get on the wrong side of your bank manager, so don&apos;t mess with us. What happens next depends to a great extent on whether the global economy can make it through the current soft patch. There are plenty of analysts who believe that policy is working \u2013 and that what we are seeing now is but a small blip. But imagine that the next three months see the traditional policy tools becoming increasingly ineffective, that the slowdown intensifies and broadens, and that the Democrats get a pasting in the mid-term elections. In those circumstances, a trade war would be entirely feasible."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/04/biodiversity-100-actions-asia", "publicationDate": "2010-10-03T23:05:01Z", "tags": ["Biodiversity", "Conservation", "Wildlife", "Endangered species", "Endangered habitats", "Environment", "Animals", "World news", "Science", "Plants", "Zoology", "Nagoya biodiversity summit 2010"], "sentences": ["Taiwan has no ban on shark finning but is not a signatory to the CBD."], "title": "Biodiversity 100: actions for Asia", "article": "Click on these links to jump straight to each action: China (state protection, mountain pikas); India (lion-tailed macaque); India and Indonesia (shark finning); Indonesia (coastal management); Japan (bluefin tuna, Okinawa Island); South Korea (Four Rivers restoration) China \u2013 state protection Action: Update China&apos;s wildlife protection law     Red-crowned cranes in Heilongjiang, China. Photograph: Keren Su/Corbis    Description: The law protecting endangered species in China is not functioning effectively. Many of the 300 species listed under China&apos;s law on the protection of wildlife (1988), which provides the first level of protection, are in decline. The baiji or Chinese river dolphin was declared extinct in 2007 for example due to loss and disturbance of its habitat. Another issue is that the law permits captive breeding centres, which often do more to supply restaurants and pharmacies than protect wild animals, even though they are listed as conservation centres. There are 164 of these farms containing scorpions, salamanders, crocodiles, heron, musk deer, black bears, golden coin turtles and cobra. The law should be updated so that its guiding policy is changed to protecting wildlife habitat, restricting wildlife trade, and abandoning wild animal consumption. Evidence: In 2000, government advisers appealed to modify national wildlife law. The most important revision regarded habitat, according to Sun Youhai, the director of the law-proposing office, the National People&apos;s Congress&apos;s environment and resources protection committee. He said: &quot;Wildlife cannot breed and live without a favourable environment. In the past we only focused on protecting wild animals, however, not enough attention had been paid to wildlife habitat, and that should be strengthened in the revision of wildlife protection law.&quot; A paper published in Conservation Biology by scientists from the Chinese Academy of Science concluded that commonly farmed wildlife has a bleak future. China \u2013 mountain pikas Action: Improve grassland habitat by stopping large-scale poisoning of mountain pikas     A pika. Photograph: D Robert Franz/Corbis    Description: Imagine a large, furry gerbil with no tail and you are close to what a pika looks like. Considered a pest, it is being poisoned over large expanses of its range across the Tibetan plateau using grain laced with botulin poison \u2013 at a cost of US$925m since 2006. This occurs despite warnings from conservation scientists that the pika is a keystone species \u2013 meaning its removal would have far-reaching consequences including a scarcity of food for mammals and birds that feed on it. Pika burrows also have two important functions, serving as nests for endemic birds and to help make alpine turf more porous, minimising soil erosion. The pika itself is far from scarce, but the focus on getting rid of it indicates a misplaced idea that the animal is responsible for the degradation of the ecosystem. Evidence: The Chinese Academy of Sciences voted the pika to be a keystone species and not a pest. A book of Conservation Biology in Asia has a chapter documenting the deleterious effect of pika poisoning. The argument that the pika is a pest, degrading rangeland and reducing food stocks for yak and sheep, is not supported by any evidence. In spite of pika culls since the 1960s, the alpine rangeland has continued to be degraded and livestock weights have decreased. Pika poisoning is not even having the effect its advocates want so it is folly to continue doing it. India \u2013 lion-tailed macaque Action: Stop forest destruction to protect the lion-tailed macaque     Lion-tailed macaque mother and infant. Photograph: Frans Lanting/Corbis    Description: Forest fragmentation is threatening populations of the lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus) by separating sub-populations and restricting them to small fragments with high population densities. The fragmentation has occurred due to the continuing encroachment of tea plantations into the forests of the Valparai plateau of Anamalai Hills and the Western Ghats in the state of Tamil Nadu. As well as lobbying for greater expansion, tea plantation companies hold the misconception that forest fragments near or on their plantations increase human-animal conflict. The Indian government and the Tamil Nadu state government have the power to stop the further destruction of the forest immediately and also create links between the forest fragments to aid the migration of the endangered lion-tailed macaque in the long-run \u2013 but have so far not done so. Evidence: Numbers of lion-tailed macaques are decreasing rapidly due to forest fragmentation. Conservationists recommend the creation of corridors between forest fragments for the migration of male lion-tailed macaque. The behaviour of this tree-dwelling macaque has also been affected: it is spending more time on the ground and are forced to eat different foods due to logging and new plantations. India and Indonesia \u2013 shark finning Action: Ban shark &quot;finning&quot; at sea     A fisherman cuts the fins off a shark. Photograph: Kambou Sia/AFP/Getty     Description: Finning is the wasteful practice of cutting off a shark&apos;s fins and discarding its carcass at sea. This happens because shark meat is generally of low value but shark fins can fetch US $100/kg as part of a gourmet dish in China. An estimated 26 to 73 million shark fins enter the global trade each year from all oceans of the world. India and Indonesia are the top two shark fishing countriesand have not banned shark finning. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and the IUCN Shark Specialist Group recommend that shark finning is banned in all national waters and international waters through the requirement that all sharks be landed with their fins naturally attached. This measure will improve the ability to enforce finning bans and collect species-specific catch data. While this is the most straightforward and reliable method for ending finning, it is not mandated in most countries&apos; finning bans or on the high seas. Legislation in all the shark fishing powers that have banned finning (Spain, Argentina, Mexico, Japan, Portugal, New Zealand and Brazil) include loopholes and exceptions. Taiwan has no ban on shark finning but is not a signatory to the CBD. Evidence: The World Food and Agriculture Organisation&apos;s global database of fish capture records data for shark landings by country. A statistical analysis published in the journal Ecology Letters found that &quot;shark biomass in the fin trade is three- to four-times higher than shark catch figures reported in the global database.&quot; The researchers extrapolated that blue sharks, one of the most commonly-traded species are &quot;close to or possibly exceeding the maximum sustainable yield levels&quot;, meaning they are close to being overfished. Approximately one-third of the shark fins traded each year are taken from pelagic sharks (meaning they live in the open water and not on the sea bed). Of the 21 oceanic pelagic sharks, 11 species are considered threatened with extinctionunder the IUCN Red List criteria. Indonesia \u2013 coastal management Action: Halt the implementation of a new law that threatens to destroy Indonesia&apos;s coastline     Archer fish in a forest of mangroves in Indonesia. Photograph: Norbert Wu/Corbis    Description: A law put in place in 2007 provides Indonesian citizens with the right to manage coastal waters in Indonesia. The new coastal areas and small island management law, called HP-3, is not fully implemented yet as the government needs to put a regulation in place so that Indonesian citizens or indigenous people can apply for their own area of water \u2013 from the surface right down to the seabed. Concessions can be granted for 20 years and extended for another 20. However, the law does not exclude large businesses, such as aquaculture, sand mining or fishery industries, from being granted the concessions. If such businesses secure large areas under the new law, scientists fear a massive degradation of the coastal ecosystem. There is a current court case arguing that the law is unconstitutional. Evidence: Indonesia has one fifth of the world&apos;s mangroves and are being rapidly destroyed by aquaculture businesses, such as shrimp farms, putting local fishermen out of work. A recent study into the threats to mangroves ecosystems found that they provide ecosystem services worth US $1.6bn each year and support coastal livelihoods around the world - including protection of the coastline from storms. Eleven out of 70 mangrove species are threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

This would have made international trade illegal. Most trade occurs between the Mediterranean where they are caught, and Japan, where one fish can sell for more than US $100,000. Japan should change its stance on bluefin tuna conservation and support a ban on international trade. Evidence: Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks have fallen below 15% of their historic levels. The scientific consensus on the issue is described in a letter to Science in June. It states:&quot;[The International Commission for the Conservaiton of Atlantic Tunas] Scientific Committee concluded (1) that there was a 95% probability that BFT [bluefish tuna] had declined to the extent that it would qualify for an Appendix I listing. This conclusion was endorsed by the majority.&quot; Japan \u2013 Okinawa Island Action: Preserve the biodiversity on Okinawa Island     Okinawa Island. Photograph: Hiroyuki Yamaguchi/Getty Images    Description: Okinawa Island is the largest island in the subtropical Ryukyu chain off the south-western coast of mainland Japan \u2013 and has been described as &quot;with some stretch of the imagination, Japan&apos;s equivalent of Hawaii&quot;. A quarter of the Yanbaru forest on the northern tip of the island is occupied by a US army base. There are already 22 US military helipads in the training area in Yanbaru, but a further seven helipads are planned within two of the best-preserved areas of the base. Appropriate legislation for conserving this region should be established, and the Okinawa defense bureau, who are commissioned to build the helipads, should consider alternative sites that will not impact Okinawa&apos;s unique biodiversity. Evidence: Yanbaru&apos;s forests are the final stand for a number of threatened endemic species such as the critically endangered Okinawa spiny rat (Tokudaia muenninki), Noguchi&apos;s woodpecker (Dendrocopos noguchii) and Namiye&apos;s frog (Limnonectes namiyei). Yanbaru&apos;s natural forests are critical habitat for many of Okinawa Island&apos;s native mammal and bird populations, but they are being destroyed by clearcutting and the removal of undergrowth.A paper on the conservation value of the region warned of the &quot;imminent extinction crisis among the endemic species of the Yunbaru forests&quot;.

Photograph: Staff/Reuters/Corbis    Description: Earlier this year, the South Korean President, Lee Myung-bak was awarded a prize for his work on protecting biodiversity by the executive secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity. At a Ramsar Convention meeting in 2008, hosted in South Korea, Lee said: &quot;South Korea will keep increasing the number of wetland protection areas and Ramsar sites&quot;. However, the Four Major Rivers Restoration project, which will cost an estimated US$17.8bn by 2012, faces bitter opposition by environmentalists both locally and internationally. It involves building 16 dams on four of the country&apos;s largest rivers, creating five tributary dams, the raising of 87 irrigation dams that are already in place; reinforcing hundreds of kilometres of riverbank and 570 million cubic metres worth of dredging. The impact on biodiversity is not fully known as the environmental impact assessment for the project is not reliable, conservationists allege. Wetlands are rich habitats for biodiversity and over 100 of them, including two wetland protection areas, will be affected. Scientists say the Four Rivers project needs to be stopped to avoid destroying more Ramsar sites and their biodiversity. Evidence: &quot;Four Rivers will be an ecological disaster,&quot; said Jeung Mingull, an ecological geneticist at Kongju National University at a hearing in Seoul administrative court in April, on an injunction to halt work on the South Han river.

The meeting on Friday, on the sidelines of the annual International Monetary Fund gathering, comes amid rising tensions between the western industrialised nations and China, whose prime minister, Wen Jiabao, is on a charm offensive in Europe this week. In separate moves designed to weaken currencies, the Bank of Japan reinstated its zero interest rate policy and pledged to buy \u00a55tn ($60bn) of assets, while Brazil doubled a tax on foreign investors buying local bonds to put a lid on a recent rally in its currency, the real. It was Brazil&apos;s finance minister, Guido Mantega, who coined the &quot;international currency war&quot; phrase last week, following a series of interventions by central banks in Japan, South Korea, Switzerland and Taiwan to make their currencies cheaper. The concerns about currency manipulation have been heightened by the global recession, with many countries, including Britain, seeing a growth in exports as the means to recovery. A weaker currency means a country&apos;s exports become more competitive. The Bank of Japan set its interest rate target to a range of zero to 0.1%, returning to zero rates for the first time in more than four years and underlining worries about the Japanese economy, which is beset by falling prices. Japanese officials intervened in the currency markets last month to weaken the yen, but the impact was only short-lived. &quot;The pace of recovery is slowing down partly due to the slowdown in overseas economies and the effects of the yen&apos;s appreciation,&quot; the bank said. Before the IMF meeting, the Institute of International Finance, an industry group representing some of the world&apos;s largest banks, urged action. In a letter to the IMF, Charles Dallara, the banking lobby&apos;s managing director, called today for greater co-operation. &quot;Urgent action is needed to arrest the disturbing trend towards unilateral moves on macroeconomic, trade and currency issues,&quot; he said. Much of the focus remains on China, which has built its economy on exports and keeps its currency artificially low. Manufacturing figures at the end of last week told a clear story of the divergent economies in the developed world and emerging markets. Factory output in Britain, the US, Spain, Ireland and Greece all fell back sharply during September, while in China, manufacturing output rebounded more quickly than economists had been expecting. The 16 nations in the eurozone again urged China to allow its currency to appreciate , complaining that Beijing&apos;s insistence on keeping the yuan weak was hampering global growth by creating trade deficits in the US and Europe. At a meeting in Brussels, Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the eurozone; the EU monetary affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn, and the European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, told Wen that the yuan remained &quot;undervalued&quot;. Juncker said: &quot;Given China&apos;s important role, we do think that a significant and broad-based appreciation [of the yuan would] promote a more balanced growth to the benefit of both China and the global economy.&quot; Following the Europe-Asia summit, Juncker said the discussions had been &quot;open, frank, but nevertheless friendly&quot; and added that both sides agreed a currency war would be &quot;destructive&quot;. But he said the plea for movement on the yuan had been rebuffed by China, which argues that it needs rapid growth in its economy to pull hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Wen, in return, said the rapidly growing economies of Asia should be granted more power within global institutions and that Europe should give up some of its seats at the IMF. In Athens at the weekend, Wen attempted to smooth over relations between China and the west by offering support for the euro and suggesting that China would participate in auctions of indebted nations&apos; government bonds, including Greece, as they seek to refinance their struggling economies. Tensions between Beijing and Washington have been mounting on the currency issue, and Congress has approved legislation enabling the US to impose trade sanctions on China and other nations that manipulate currencies to win competitive advantage. China is also under pressure to stimulate its domestic economy in order to build a market for exports from other nations."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/06/question-answer-international-currency-wars", "publicationDate": "2010-10-06T12:27:53Z", "tags": ["Dominique Strauss-Kahn", "Currencies", "Business", "Economics", "Global economy"], "sentences": ["Emerging economies from Brazil to Taiwan are desperately trying to stem the capital inflows to prevent their currencies rising further."], "title": "Q&A: International currency wars", "article": "Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, has warned governments against using exchange rates as a &quot;policy weapon&quot; \u2013 saying a currency war risks undermining the global economic recovery. What is this international currency war I&apos;m hearing about? Brazil&apos;s finance minister Guido Mantega coined the phrase last week. Around the world, countries are manipulating their currencies to gain a competitive advantage in trade. The IMF is taking the problem seriously, with strong comments from its head this week, who said governments risked a currency war by using exchange rates to solve their own domestic problems, which in turn could derail the global recovery. What is actually happening? America has printed a lot of money to kickstart its stagnant economy and this has weakened the dollar, thereby making dollar assets less attractive to foreign investors. So, chasing high returns, all this hot money has been flowing into emerging markets like Brazil, which came through the global crisis relatively unscathed. According to investment bank Goldman Sachs, Brazil&apos;s real is the most overvalued major currency in the world. Emerging economies from Brazil to Taiwan are desperately trying to stem the capital inflows to prevent their currencies rising further. But I thought a strong currency was a symbol of economic health? Germany&apos;s Deutschmark was legendary. But in times of economic trouble countries prefer a low currency because it makes exporters&apos; goods and services more competitive abroad. Many countries, including Britain, are (partly) counting on exports to pull their economies out of the downturn, especially because tax hikes and spending cuts are going to hit domestic demand (consumers and businesses) hard. However, IMF chief Strauss-Kahn has warned that devaluing currencies could backfire as the resulting volatility poses a &quot;serious risk&quot; to the global recovery. What impact will the hostilities have? Economists fear that some countries&apos; attempts to weaken their currencies are resulting in increased currency volatility and instability \u2013 which makes it harder to come up with a co-ordinated policy response to the downturn, amid fears of a renewed slowdown. Central bankers like Mervyn King have long warned of the impact of global imbalances (such as America&apos;s trade deficit versus China&apos;s huge surplus), which he said was one of the key factors in the global downturn. So how do you devalue a currency? Put simply, countries can sell their currency to try to bring its value down. The Bank of Japan recently intervened in foreign exchange markets to sell the yen, but the impact was short-lived. Switzerland began selling Swiss francs on foreign exchanges last year and Israel has also admitted that without intervention, its currency would be much stronger. In a fixed exchange rate system the authorities formally set a new fixed rate with respect to a foreign reference currency. For example, in January Venezuela devalued the bolivar for the first time since 2005, slashing its value against the dollar. Are there any other ways a country can weaken its currency? There are a host of measures, from cutting interest rates to buying foreign assets. The Bank of Japan has reinstated its zero interest rate policy \u2013 which reduces returns on Japanese investments, thereby making it less attractive for foreign investors to own them \u2013 while Brazil doubled a tax on foreign investors buying local bonds to put a lid on a recent rally in its currency. China wants to buy Greek bonds, ostensibly as a sign of confidence in the country&apos;s ability to escape default, but European policymakers are worried that this would push up the euro against the yuan. What has Britain done? Along with the US, Britain has flooded the economy with liquidity through quantitative easing (with possibly another round to come) and kept interest rates extremely low, effectively devaluing its currency. What are the implications for consumers? Consumers won&apos;t be happy with a weak currency. Your pound will be worth less on holiday and prices will rise in Britain as imported goods become more expensive. In the long run this means that interest rates will have to go up to combat higher inflation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/06/expert-views-currency-wars", "publicationDate": "2010-10-06T12:50:46Z", "tags": ["Currencies", "Global economy", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Quantitative easing", "Economics", "Business", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Europe"], "sentences": ["Perng Fai-nan, Taiwan&apos;s central bank governor (30 September) The US printed a lot of money, so there&apos;s a lot of hot money flowing around.", "We see hot money in Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia."], "title": "The international currency war: what the experts say", "article": "Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, has warned that an international currency war risks undermining the global recovery. Here is what he and other policymakers around the world have said about exchange rates recently. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, IMF managing director (5 October) There is clearly the idea beginning to circulate that currencies can be used as a policy weapon. Translated into action, such an idea would represent a very serious risk to the global recovery... Any such approach would have a negative and very damaging longer-run impact. Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel economics laureate (5 October) The irony is that the Fed is creating all this liquidity with the hope that it will revive the American economy. It&apos;s doing nothing for the American economy, but it&apos;s causing chaos over the rest of the world. It&apos;s a very strange policy that they are pursuing. Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of eurozone finance ministers (5 October) China&apos;s real effective exchange rate remains undervalued. The Chinese authorities do not share our view. Subir Gokarn, India&apos;s central bank deputy governor (5 October) It is becoming a larger global problem because of the imbalance, that there is so much of liquidity and the returns are skewed towards emerging markets. So it is emerging as a potential threat and we are clearly thinking of ways in which we can deal with it. Robert Zoellick, World Bank president (4 October) I don&apos;t foresee that we&apos;re moving into an era of global currency wars but there are clearly going to be tensions. Money is chasing yield. It can&apos;t find those yields in developed economies and this is not only pushing up currency values in developing countries... [but] also pushing up prices in assets with the risk of bubbles in property and some commodities. Stanley Fischer, Israel&apos;s central bank governor (3 October) There is no doubt that without intervention the shekel would be much stronger. But we are not China \u2013 we are not going to buy $500bn next year. Perng Fai-nan, Taiwan&apos;s central bank governor (30 September) The US printed a lot of money, so there&apos;s a lot of hot money flowing around. We see hot money in Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia. These short-term capital flows are disturbing emerging economies. Henrique Meirelles, Brazil&apos;s central bank governor (29 September) Evidently, there is a very serious currency problem which should be addressed. It&apos;s not necessarily a war. Some countries seem to have a problem... Brazil is not going to pay the price. Guido Mantega, Brazil&apos;s finance minister (27 September) We&apos;re in the midst of an international currency war. This threatens us because it takes away our competitiveness. Chen Jian, China&apos;s commerce vice-minister (27 September) on proposed US bill to force China to allow the yuan to rise in value We&apos;ll make a decision based on our own economic development levels and the world economic situation. If it takes the yuan to appreciate for our economy to develop, we will do it even though it would have negative impact. But it is redundant for the US Congress to pass the proposal. Yoshihiko Noda, Japanese finance minister (17 September) on Japan&apos;s intervention to weaken the yen I&apos;m aware that there are various opinions. But Japan&apos;s stance is that a prolonged yen rise is undesirable as the economy remains in a severe situation with ongoing deflation. It is important to consistently explain our stance to the international community.

The demand came a week before a meeting in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, that will bring together defence ministers of the region as well as the US defence secretary, Robert Gates. China has accused the fishermen, who were taken near the disputed Paracel Islands, of breaking the law by fishing with explosives and said they would be released after a fine is paid. Vietnam has responded by describing the arrest as &quot;irrational&quot;. &quot;Fishing boat QNg 66478TS was carrying out its ordinary operations in Vietnam&apos;s Hoang Sa [Paracel] archipelago sovereign waters,&quot; a Vietnamese official was quoted as saying on the Vietnamnet website. &quot;There were no explosives on the boat. On 15 September, Vietnam&apos;s embassy in China received a note from China which did not mention that the boat was carrying explosives.&quot; Vietnam says the fishermen were on a routine fishing trip in Vietnamese waters, using fishing nets and lamps. Its foreign ministry has sent a diplomatic note to the Chinese embassy in Hanoi, stressing that the arrest had seriously violated Vietnam&apos;s sovereignty. Asian countries have become increasingly nervous at China&apos;s growing assertiveness in the potentially oil-rich South China Sea, where China, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan all have competing claims. The region closely followed a dispute between China and Japan, when Japan detained a Chinese crew in early September for allegedly ramming Japanese patrol boats near disputed islands in the East China Sea. Japan released the crew and then the captain after coming under heavy pressure and threats from China. The Vietnam-China spat could be an irritant at next week&apos;s high-level meeting in Hanoi of defence ministers from the Association of South East Asian Nations and eight other countries, including China, Japan and the US. However, Gates will meet his Chinese counterpart, General Liang Guanglie, as the US and China move to end an eight-month freeze on military exchanges. China suspended military contacts in January in protest at US arms sales to Taiwan. China pointedly refused to invite Gates to Beijing during his trip to the region in June. American officials have been keen to resume military contacts with China at a time of heightening tension in the Pacific. Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and Australia, have all moved to boost co-operation with the US in response to what they see as China&apos;s growing willingness to throw its weight around. China, in turn, sees such moves as US encroachment into its neighbourhood. The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, angered China when she said recently that America had a &quot;national interest&quot; in seeing the territorial disputes resolved through a &quot;collaborative diplomatic process by all claimants&quot;. China claims sovereignty over the entire 3.5m square-kilometre South China Sea, dotted with disputed groups of islands."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/06/currency-war-warning-imf-chief", "publicationDate": "2010-10-07T00:43:00Z", "tags": ["Currencies", "Business", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Global economy", "Economics", "World news", "Wen Jiabao"], "sentences": ["Brazil&apos;s finance minister, Guido Mantega, coined the phrase &quot;international currency war&quot; last week, following a series of interventions by central banks in Japan, South Korea, Switzerland and Taiwan to make their currencies cheaper."], "title": "China warns against rapid rise in yuan", "article": "The war of words over international currency valuations escalated yesterday when the Chinese premier Wen Jiabao told the European Union to stop pressuring Beijing to revalue the yuan as any rapid shift risked unleashing serious social unrest in China.

But Wen said yesterday that China&apos;s trade surplus with the US was explained by the specific structures of the two economies, not the yuan exchange rate. He noted that a US congressman had predicted social unrest in China if there was a rapid rise in the yuan. &quot;Many of our exporting companies would have to close down,&quot; Wen said. &quot;Migrant workers would have to return to their villages. If China saw social and economic turbulence, then it would be a disaster for the world.&quot; His remarks come as finance ministers from the G7 are about to discuss growing concerns over currency wars on the sidelines of the annual IMF gathering in Washington on Friday. Timothy Geithner, the US treasury secretary who visited China earlier this year to plead the case for a higher yuan, said in Washington that a &quot;damaging dynamic&quot; of large economies keeping their currencies undervalued can cause inflation and asset bubbles. He called on countries to co-ordinate their policies. &quot;More and more countries face stronger pressure to lean against the market forces pushing up the value of their currencies,&quot; he said yesterday at the Brookings Institution in Washington. He said currencies are &quot;inherently a multilateral issue. It&apos;s much easier to solve if countries come together and do things to complement each other. Geithner&apos;s comments echoed calls by the IMF for greater currency flexibility. The organisation&apos;s chief waded into the row, warning governments against using exchange rates as a weapon. Dominique Strauss-Kahn told the Financial Times: &quot;There is clearly the idea beginning to circulate that currencies can be used as a policy weapon. Translated into action, such an idea would represent a very serious risk to the global recovery \u2026 any such approach would have a negative and very damaging longer-run impact.&quot; The Bank of Japan reinstated its zero interest-rate policy and pledged to buy \u00a55tn (\u00a337bn) of assets, leading to a drop in the yen. In recent weeks it has also intervened in the currency markets to weaken the yen for the first time in six years, although the impact was short-lived. Brazil has threatened intervention to weaken the real. On Monday, it doubled a tax on foreign investors buying local bonds to put a lid on a recent rally in its currency. Brazil&apos;s finance minister, Guido Mantega, coined the phrase &quot;international currency war&quot; last week, following a series of interventions by central banks in Japan, South Korea, Switzerland and Taiwan to make their currencies cheaper. Strauss-Kahn appeared to refer to Mantega&apos;s comments when he said: &quot;We have seen reports that some emerging countries whose economies face big capital inflows are saying that maybe it is time to use their currencies to try to gain an advantage, particularly on the trade side. I don&apos;t think that is a good solution.&quot; The weak dollar and expectations that the US Federal Reserve may announce stimulus measures pushed gold to a new record high yesterday.

China Daily said the award was &quot;part of the plot to contain China&quot; and amounted to gross interference in its internal affairs. &quot;It can do little except \u2026 highlight the deep and wide ideological rift between this country and the west,&quot; it said. The angry stand-off between American and Chinese negotiators at the latest climate change talks also reflected a fundamental difference of approach. As with the diverging views of human rights dramatised by Liu&apos;s award, Beijing firmly defended its &quot;right&quot; to pursue its own developmental path, as other major carbon emitters have done before it. Its position recalled Iran&apos;s insistence on its &quot;nuclear rights&quot;. This sovereign-tist outlook also partly explains China&apos;s stance in another dispute with the west, over its &quot;undervalued&quot; currency, which was the focus on an inconclusive IMF meeting at the weekend. Chinese leaders routinely say they will not be dictated to on exchange rates. But they also fear &quot;social turmoil&quot;, as premier Wen Jiabao suggested last week, if prices rise sharply. In this instance, too, pride and stubbornness are reinforced by insecurity. Officials readily concede China suffers from a sort of historical paranoia that influences its present-day behaviour. &quot;The continuous loss of territory has been one of the deepest wounds in the Chinese psyche in the century following the opium war in 1840,&quot; said Qingli Dai, a Chinese diplomat in London. It was &quot;very hard for the Chinese people to accept that Chinese fishermen could be seized in China&apos;s own territory by a foreign country,&quot; Dai said. Dai was referring to the latest flare-up with Japan over ownership of the Diaoyu islands in the East China sea (called the Senkaku islands in Japan), when a Chinese trawler captain was arrested. The clash led to an outpouring of bad feeling and nationalist anger that periodically disfigures Sino-Japanese relations. It was a brief spasm, mostly patched up for now. But as with China&apos;s other international disputes, the ongoing, underlying tensions are palpable and the lack of long-term remedies evident. An inaugural meeting of Asia-Pacific defence ministers in Hanoi on Monday, including the Pentagon&apos;s Robert Gates, gave China&apos;s neighbours a chance to discuss what several, including Indonesia and Vietnam, see as a worrying new physical assertiveness by China in both the East and South China seas \u2013 which they say it increasingly views as its own backyard, in much the way Washington once viewed Latin America. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, angered Beijing earlier this year by stating that unimpeded navigation and the peaceful resolution of disputes in these areas was a US national interest. In Hanoi, Gates followed up, urging all parties to settle their differences multilaterally \u2013 an approach Beijing sees as disrespectful of its sovereign rights. US-China military dialogue is slowly reviving after a row over Taiwan; Gates was invited to visit China next year. But by publicly siding with (and arming) China&apos;s neighbours and insisting on what Barack Obama calls a &quot;leadership role in Asia&quot;, Washington risks replicating the China-versus-the-west confrontation, this time on the Asian stage. This prospect led Time magazine to warn last week of Asia&apos;s &quot;new cold war&quot;, comprising regional proxy struggles between China and the US as Beijing&apos;s military, economic and political clout grows. China&apos;s growing use of civilian vessels, often fishing fleets, as &quot;command militias&quot;, acting unofficially on behalf of its navy in disputed waters, is one rising concern. Last year, two American warships, the Victorious and the Impeccable, were harassed by civilian ships reportedly co-ordinating with the Chinese navy. None of this should come as a surprise, suggested Francois Godement in Geopolitics on Chinese terms, published by the European Council on Foreign Relations. The established western view of China as committed to a purely defensive foreign policy while it builds up its economic strength was obsolete, he said. Most experts agreed that a &quot;global power shift&quot; was already well under way. How it would turn out was a matter of debate. But in one view, at least, Godemont reported, China&apos;s &quot;cautious approach based on conflict avoidance is a temporary strategy intended to be applied while China rises. Ultimately, a China which has completed its ascent will &apos;let its writ run without constraint&apos;.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/12/china-nobel-prize-liu-xiaobo", "publicationDate": "2010-10-12T16:31:01Z", "tags": ["China", "Liu Xiaobo", "Nobel peace prize", "Protest", "Human rights", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["We don&apos;t have to look far to find two examples of authoritarian command economies that once imprisoned dissent and stifled free speech and are now prosperous democracies: South Korea and Taiwan."], "title": "Keeping the pressure on China | Wu'er Kaixi", "article": "It may not be easy to reconcile the recent pledges by the Chinese premier that China will carry out political reforms with its official, outraged reaction to the Nobel peace prize awarded to the dissident Liu Xiaobo, a former teacher at Beijing Normal University who joined us student protesters in the Tiananmen uprising. But for China watchers \u2013 and for those of us involved in the rights struggle in China \u2013 the cries of &quot;a blasphemy&quot; and threats of diplomatic repercussions for Norway came as no surprise. This is the reaction to be expected from a government that does not tolerate dissent \u2013 and will never carry out reforms without a lot more pressure than it has received in the past two decades. The petulant rhetoric of misunderstood authoritarian regimes can strike an amusing note (when the Dalai Lama won the 1989 prize, Beijing retorted that he was a &quot;wolf in monk&apos;s robes&quot;). But China is not a &quot;hermit state&quot; like North Korea or Myanmar. It is the world&apos;s second largest economy and, not so long ago, it was host to the Olympics. And this is the reason that the Norwegian Nobel peace prize committee&apos;s decision to turn the screws should not only be applauded, but welcomed. It is hopefully the first of many steps the west will carry out to put pressure on China and ensure that premier Wen Jiabao&apos;s calls for political reform are more than just a sop to critics abroad. The time has come for the world to begin to engage China intelligently \u2013 something it has not done in the past 21 years I have been in exile. It is time to abandon the delusional notion that economic prosperity will lead to political reform \u2013 it hasn&apos;t and it won&apos;t. It is also time to abandon the specious argument that China&apos;s &quot;special conditions&quot; justify authoritarian one-party rule. Yes, China is a big country but that does not automatically strip its people of rights we hold to be fundamental elsewhere. We don&apos;t have to look far to find two examples of authoritarian command economies that once imprisoned dissent and stifled free speech and are now prosperous democracies: South Korea and Taiwan. The west played a role in their transition \u2013 encouraging free trade and applying pressure when it came to human rights. It is time to take the same approach to China. Pressure will not transform China into a thriving democracy any time soon. But it would provide hope to brave Chinese who struggle for voices to be heard and are seeking redress for land grabs, forced relocations and illegal detainment of petitioners among a host of other injustices. In 1989, we exiled student protesters were received well in the west. We faced tanks and machine guns in Beijing, but we had the support of the rest of the world. This made us believe that with the support of the international community we could help pressure China into becoming a freer and more tolerant place. Unfortunately, all too quickly, it was business as normal and Tiananmen became an inconvenience. Before meeting us or giving us a venue to voice our views, people began to consider what kind of message that would send to the Chinese regime. But not meeting us and sweeping our views aside sent another message to the Chinese regime \u2013 that the human rights movement in China was no longer relevant to the outside world, and we had become insignificant. I have been told as much during the course of my long and failed negotiations to either be allowed to return to China or for my parents to be issued passports so they can visit me. Hopefully, the Nobel prize committee&apos;s decision to recognize Liu will be a reminder to Beijing that human rights in China have not been forgotten. Hopefully it will be a reminder to others in the west that it is still possible to put principles ahead of business interests. Chinese dissidents like Liu will continue to play the role they have done while the rest of the world mostly looked the other way. This is a common responsibility for all of us at odds with the regime in China \u2013 no matter whether in exile or facing injustice at home. But it is also a global responsibility because it is in global interests. Applying pressure where pressure is due is the only way to make China a more responsible partner on the world stage. And a freer, more transparent and more accountable China is a China that the world can talk to and negotiate with. To fail to engage with China in this way is to passively encourage China to go its own way, to make up its own rules. Engaging with China is not only the right thing to do; it would be wrong not to do so. To not act is a kind of appeasement, and it sends a message to China that it can do what it likes with impunity. If we want to see a China whose astounding economic growth is matched by a political culture that speaks our language, we have to act together to bring that culture into existence. I hope the peace committee&apos;s latest decision inspires people worldwide to imagine that the message we send the Chinese regime does not have to be the one it wants to hear. The alternative is to risk another Tiananmen \u2013 or the creation of an intractable world power that tolerates dissenting opinions abroad as little as it does at home."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/oct/14/china-tennis-shanghai-masters", "publicationDate": "2010-10-14T12:38:15Z", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport"], "sentences": ["This week they had Zhang Ze, who nearly beat the former world No3 Ivan Ljubicic (Murray&apos;s conqueror in Beijing last Friday), Wu Di, who battled the flu in losing bravely to Taiwan&apos;s Lu Yen-hsun (the world No42who beat Andy Roddick at Wimbledon), and Nanjing&apos;s Bai Yan.", "What we need are [more] overseas coaches and players.&quot; The mainland Chinese are simultaneously encouraged by and jealous of their Taiwanese neighbours."], "title": "Home heroes required to seal China's burgeoning interest in tennis | Kevin Mitchell", "article": "For years China was a Communist mystery. Now it is a capitalist conundrum as well. As prominent former party leaders campaign this week for press freedom in response to the attacks on the Nobel Prize winner and dissident Liu Xiaobo, it is clear the old order is still wrestling with the global element of financial and political change. It is certainly an interesting time to be in Shanghai, the acceptable long-time waterfront of China&apos;s love affair with money. If it occurs at first that sport has little to do with these high-powered intrigues, the evidence suggests otherwise. Sport is very much a lever in the process of cultural and financial integration in the People&apos;s Republic, and the Shanghai Masters, a rich tournament intricately linked with the spread of tennis across the world, is one obvious manifestation of that seemingly unstoppable process. For a start, Rolex, one of the chic symbols of international wrist candy, have upped their commitment to $3,240,000 (\u00a32.02m). And, just as importantly, the top 20 players in the world are happy to come here. This is no throwaway hit-up in the boondocks. It is a serious piece of tennis&apos;s lucrative jigsaw. What the Shanghai event has yet to crack \u2013 after eight years in various forms \u2013 is an audience. It is a crowded market in a very crowded country and attendances this week in the 15,000-seater showpiece Stadium court at the well-appointed five-year-old venue on the outskirts of this vast port city have been meagre. They will pick up at the weekend when the elite and the favoured take their places to watch the glamorous conclusion. In the lead-up, though, Chinese tennis fans are content to watch the likes of Rafa Nadal and Roger Federer on television. TV, as everywhere, is the engine that drives sport in China, and tennis has to get in the queue with several equally ambitious rivals. Football and basketball have been huge here for years, golf is the perennial deal-making sport for big business, boxing is popular and rugby, snooker and cricket are also competing vigorously for attention in a fickle marketplace. Where once ping-pong and martial arts prevailed, now there are suitors from sports that have worldwide connections salivating over the biggest honeypot in the world. This month it is tennis&apos;s turn, after the China Open in Beijing last week and now the penultimate Masters 1000 of the season. If tennis is beyond the vast mass of Chinese as a sport to play because of the cost, it has a small but growing fan base to encourage the clearly solid corporate support. Every day outside the players&apos; hotel, the Hilton in the old French Concession of downtown Shanghai, a gaggle of 20 or 30 giggling girls dripping in teenage haute couture queue for hours to catch a glimpse of the millionaires who entertain them on court. But what the fans crave \u2013 and what the game is hunting for across China \u2013 are a few more local heroes. This week they had Zhang Ze, who nearly beat the former world No3 Ivan Ljubicic (Murray&apos;s conqueror in Beijing last Friday), Wu Di, who battled the flu in losing bravely to Taiwan&apos;s Lu Yen-hsun (the world No42who beat Andy Roddick at Wimbledon), and Nanjing&apos;s Bai Yan. So obscure was Mr Bai, the western media (yes, including the Guardian) transposed his first and second names when he beat the 30th-ranked Radek Stepanek, the well-travelled Czech who put Murray out of the Paris Masters last year. We knew who Mr Bai was by the time he walked on to the main Stadium court against Murray in the second round, but he found that challenge beyond him. &quot;Chinese male players, especially,&quot; Bai said after his 6-2, 6-2 defeat, &quot;are still in the beginning stages of the professional game. None of us has played much at the highest level. What we need are [more] overseas coaches and players.&quot; The mainland Chinese are simultaneously encouraged by and jealous of their Taiwanese neighbours. Taipei&apos;s Yang &quot;Little Fatty&quot; Tsung-Hua, who gave the highly regarded J\u00fcrgen Melzer a scare, is another player from the ostracised island who made an impact this week. One man who has a handle on where Chinese tennis is going is Brad Drewett, a national junior champion in Australia who went on to be a decent player on the circuit (he reached 34th in the world in the early 1980s), and who is now responsible for the development of sport in Asia as the chief executive of ATP International. He knows how tough it is to find and groom prodigies, but says China has plenty of raw talent. &quot;The programmes here have developed significantly over the last five years and there are many very good junior players,&quot; he said. &quot;Federer held a clinic in Shanghai the other day [with] the best 11- and 12-year-olds. The feedback I got was there were a number of very exciting young prospects. &quot;I would hope in five, six to seven years we will have some significant players who are not just playing, but competing, and competing well, on the ATP World Tour. If that were to happen, the potential is unimaginable.&quot; Drewett would love his Chinese partners to find tennis equivalent of the NBA giant Yao Ming, who is back home this week with the Houston Rockets and attracting massive crowds. The financial impact of such a discovery would be enormous. Drewett acknowledges the achievements of Li Na, who is ranked among the top 10 women in the world, but knows the key to unlocking the Chinese treasure chest is finding, &quot;the first truly great male professional player&quot;. None has appeared yet, but Drewett maintains: &quot;It&apos;s not a matter of if, it&apos;s a matter of when.&quot; In the country of the Long March, time and patience are familiar friends. Courtside tickets for Sunday&apos;s final range between \u00a3411 at the top end and \u00a373 for students.

Needless to say, it&apos;s been a good year for Steve Jobs and the rest of the gang in Cupertino. The world&apos;s No 1 electronics brand&apos;s stock is at a record high that analysts say will continue to rally throughout 2011 due to increasing global demand for the iPad. But there is a minor threat that the feel-good vibes of Apple&apos;s supernatural profits will be undermined by a different kind of report. Released earlier this week, Workers as machines: military management in Foxconn is a critical evaluation of the company that manufactures iPhones and iPads, among other brands of gadgetry. Produced by the non-profit organisation Students and Scholars against Corporate Misbehaviour (Sacom), the report contains the findings of a four-month investigation of the working conditions at the Foxconn factories in Shenzhen and Hangzhou, where 17 workers killed themselves earlier this year, many of them by jumping out of factory windows. In addition to the numerous issues explored in the report, which include allegations of illegal labour practices and unsafe facilities, it contends that Foxconn workers are subject to a management culture of &quot;absolute obedience&quot;. According to the report, factory employees are disciplined if they fail to make production quotas or spend too much time in the bathroom. Punishment may take the form of public humiliation, confession or the rote transcription of quotes from Foxconn chairman (and Taiwan&apos;s richest man) Terry Guo, which include such gems as: &quot;Hungry people have especially clear minds&quot; and &quot;a harsh environment is a good thing&quot;. The report&apos;s descriptions of the Foxconn work and dormitory environment reads like an Orwellian laundry list. Those who don&apos;t return to their room before the 23:30 curfew are forced to &quot;volunteer&quot; for janitorial duty. Workers are not permitted to talk, nap, laugh or stretch while they work. Those required to stand while working are instructed to stand like a soldier. Foxconn security guards, who some workers consider more of a private police force, often insult and sometimes physically attack the workers. The report also claims that the promises of a pay raises made after the suicides failed to materialise, or were offset by other deductions. Specific to Apple&apos;s recent fourth-quarter triumph, the report quotes a Foxconn engineer who states that during the production of the first-generation iPad, workers had to work 12 hours per day and were only permitted to rest every 13th day. In response to the report, Foxconn has stated that it &quot;strongly and categorically rejects&quot; the allegations and that &quot;Foxconn is certainly not perfect, but we take our responsibility to our employees very seriously and we are committed to giving each and every one of our more than 937,000 employees in China a safe and positive working environment and compensation and benefits that are competitive with all of our industry peers.&quot; Meanwhile, when contacted Apple maintained that they are &quot;committed to ensuring the highest standards of social responsibility throughout our supply base&quot;. Jobs has yet to personally comment on the Sacom report, but when news of the suicides surfaced in June, he insisted that Foxconn was &quot;not a sweatshop&quot; and that &quot;Apple does one of the best jobs of any company understanding the working conditions of our supply chain&quot;. Although a number of electronics firms outsource their production to Foxconn, those protesting the conditions at the company are focusing their ire on Apple. In their report, Sacom point out that the Apple supplier code of conduct was designed to protect workers from the very abuse they have witnessed, but claims that the majority of Foxconn workers have no knowledge that such a code exists. The iPhone 4 currently retails at \u00a3599, but is estimated by iSupply, a technology research firm, to cost a mere  $6.54 (\u00a34.12) to manufacture - that is, put together - in China (the researchers estimate the cost of the components, which come from various sources, at a further $187.51). If, as Jobs has stated, Apple is indeed aware of the working conditions at Foxconn, and if the Sacom report is factual, then it&apos;s only fair to assume that Apple has taken a rather pragmatic position on its code of conduct and concluded that you can&apos;t make \u00a316bn per quarter without crushing a few spirits. Perhaps electronics consumers have simply come to accept the unsavoury side of outsourced mass production. As demonstrated by Banksy&apos;s recent Simpson&apos;s couch gag, the imagery of an Asian sweatshop is anything but shocking. It&apos;s been woven so tightly into the fabric of western economies that it&apos;s come to be expected. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2010.

Excuse me for not getting too excited. I&apos;ve never felt a joy within, a sense sublime at what is basically a hairy, swollen ball, tough-skinned and acid-fleshed. Kiwis are among the more curious fruits: while there&apos;s a pithy citrus family, while the peach is the fuzzy cousin of the nectarine, while apples and pears offer comparable joys, while the merry cherry seems to me different only in degree from, say, a plum or grape, there&apos;s nothing remotely like the kiwi. In Taiwan and Hong Kong they call it &quot;q\u00edy\u00ec gu\u01d2&quot; meaning strange or unusual fruit, a clever half-transliteration of the old Maori word. There&apos;s just something weirdly ... scrotal about them. They take several decades to ripen in the fruit bowl, fanned by wailing flies, and when they do their flesh is never as sweet as you want it to be. The texture is off, too: pellet-hard when underripe, always mushy when &quot;ready&quot;. And the stench of overripe kiwi flesh is beyond appalling, a nostril-cloaking fug reeking of sulphur, death and badger shit, putrescence and ancient slime. Have you ever tasted a kiwi fruit, raised the floppy flesh from the hacked brown salad and proclaimed it as one of the most ambrosially delicious things on earth? I know no one who calls it their favourite fruit. The sweet sting of an early raspberry, the heralded reach for the peach \u2013 they mark the year and season. Never so the kiwi.A triumph of modern marketing, the kiwi fruit. It&apos;s native to China, and existed for many millennia in complete and deserved obscurity around the upstream areas of the Yangtze, and in Sichuan. The sensible Chinese never incorporated the fruit into their cuisine: for most of its history &quot;m\u00edh\u00f3u t\u00e1o&quot; or macaque peach featured only in tonics for children or for women after childbirth. We have a teacher-cum-missionary named Mary Isabel Fraser to thank for our own knowledge of it. After a trip to China in 1903, Fraser introduced the seeds to her native New Zealand, mistakenly naming the fruit yang tao, which is in fact the carambola. Her country had its first crop in 1910.  The kiwi was a curio until the second world war, grown only by a few New Zealand households. The most common and hardiest cultivar, the Hayward (no relation), emerged in 1924, and by the early 1940s the fruit had assumed the name &quot;chinese gooseberry&quot;. It was briefly and horrifyingly known as the &quot;melonette&quot; in the 1950s, a name of such Norman Rockwellish, Reader&apos;s Digesty, piped-mashed-potatoey horror it chills one&apos;s bones. (The French still call it &quot;souris v\u00e9g\u00e9tale&quot; or vegetable mouse, which is much more appealing.) However, in the US of the late 50s, &quot;chinese gooseberry&quot; carried a regrettable Cold War stigma, while melons were subject to notorious import tariffs. When the American buyer asked for a new name, the New Zealand producers suggested &quot;kiwi fruit&quot; after that country&apos;s national bird (itself supposedly good to eat, but don&apos;t mention that in Auckland). The new term stuck. The kiwi&apos;s heyday was surely the 1960s and 70s, when it basked and revelled as the favoured garnish of nouvelle cuisine, that now unfairly maligned revolution in French food which did eventually disappear into its own fruiting cluster. I can&apos;t help feeling that the kiwi&apos;s then popularity derived more from its rarity and its vaguely exotic look than from any enjoyable flavour. Although in the early 1980s only 5% of American households had heard of it, by 1986 the fruit was in 84% of American supermarkets. Alas for the kiwi, its vogue was short-lived. Production peaked in New Zealand in 1988 before swiftly declining, and Italy now harvests the most. Global sales seem to be increasing again as new markets emerge in places like India and Russia, but I wonder whether the people there, too, will soon grow tired of the dun, hairy drupe. I admit that a slice of kiwi is a pretty thing, the black seeds bursting from the puckered centre, the livid swoosh of ectoplasm. But it&apos;s useless in the kitchen. The New Zealand-based kiwi fruit marketing board Zespri offers such drab recipes as yoghurt whip and &quot;kid&apos;s kiwi fruit cone&quot;, and even our own late, lamented Keith Floyd took the Zespri buck to record this weepingly awful promotion for such delights as prawns with marie rose and sliced kiwi and, most emetically, chicken breast stuffed with the stuff. Larousse Gastronomique has two recipes for kiwi fruit. One is a fruit salad, the other pork chops with kiwi fruit sauce. Between them, they evoke an unmistakeable sense of barrel-scraping desperation. Kiwi doesn&apos;t even want to go with other foods. Like pineapples and papayas, its flesh contains actinidin. This enzyme is handy for the food industry because it tenderises proteins and makes meat easier to digest, but it&apos;s also a strong allergen that can cause people to go into anaphylactic shock. Actinidin renders raw kiwi useless in milk-based desserts because the enzyme breaks down milk proteins. (Jane Grigson&apos;s recipe for kiwifruit cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is one of the more vaguely appealing uses of the fruit, but then she cooks the kiwis.) Nor can you make jelly from it.  People took to the kiwi because of its novelty and attractive appearance, not because of its taste. It&apos;s the Duracell bunny of the fruit world, fluffy and fun but full of something corrosive. Perhaps I&apos;d see things differently if I went to New Zealand or Italy and had a fresh one that hadn&apos;t sustained months of cold storage like the brown globes in London supermarkets. But I don&apos;t think so. What do you make of the kiwi?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/22/geithner-g20-stop-manipulating-currencies", "publicationDate": "2010-10-22T08:03:32Z", "tags": ["Timothy Geithner", "Business", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Global economy", "Currencies", "Economics", "G20", "World news"], "sentences": ["Other countries, including Brazil, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland and Taiwan have also moved to weaken their currencies."], "title": "Timothy Geithner calls on G20 nations to move to avert global currency war", "article": "US treasury secretary Timothy Geithner has told the G20 nations to stop manipulating their currencies to prevent &quot;excessive volatility&quot; and a global currency war.

Other countries, including Brazil, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland and Taiwan have also moved to weaken their currencies. In his letter, Geithner said: &quot;First, G20 countries should commit to undertake policies consistent with reducing external imbalances below a specified share of GDP over the next few years, recognising that some exceptions may be required for countries that are structurally large exporters of raw materials. &quot;This means that G20 countries running persistent deficits should boost national savings by adopting credible medium-term fiscal targets consistent with sustainable debt levels and by strengthening export performance. Conversely, G20 countries with persistent surpluses should undertake structural, fiscal and exchange rate policies to boost domestic sources of growth and support global demand.&quot; He called on countries to refrain from manipulating currencies to achieve competitive advantage by either weakening their currency or preventing the appreciation of an undervalued currency \u2013 a clear dig at China. He also said the IMF should monitor progress on G20 countries&apos; commitments and publish a semiannual report."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/24/china-one-child-policy-eased", "publicationDate": "2010-10-24T14:00:01Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Abortion", "Population", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Hong Kong has a fertility rate of one, Taiwan 1.1 and Japan 1.3, alongside a figure of 1.6 for China."], "title": "China's one-child policy is slowly being eased | Therese Hesketh", "article": "A story has surfaced on a Chinese blog \u2013 subsequently picked up by the Toronto Sun and Al-Jazeera \u2013 about a woman from a county in Xiamen city, south-eastern China, who at eight months pregnant was dragged from her home by family planning officials, beaten up, detained for three days and then forced to undergo an abortion. This, it is claimed, was because she already had a nine-year-old daughter and was violating the rules of the one-child policy. Whatever the truth of these allegations, this kind of event is extremely rare now in China \u2013 especially in urban China, where it could not be kept secret. The officials involved could expect punishment for such an abuse of their power. In the very early years of the policy in the early 1980s such stories of forced abortion were not rare, but the way the one-child policy has been interpreted and enforced has changed with the times. This is partly because people are accustomed to its constraints: one child allowed for urban residents and two for rural residents, especially when the first is a girl. This acceptance means that there is much less need to employ coercive or punitive measures. When the policy was introduced in 1979, it was planned to last for a generation. The original goal was to slow the population growth rate. This has been achieved, but at the price of a rapidly increasing proportion of elderly dependent people, and a worrying excess of males in many parts of China. This is because couples choose to abort female foetuses in order to guarantee a boy, within the constraints of small family size and a strong tradition of son preference. The government has been considering options for relaxing the policy. China has undergone massive socioeconomic change during the past 30 years. With the freedoms that have resulted from wealth and globalisation, the one-child policy seems increasingly anachronistic. Increased wealth and freedom also make it harder for the government to enforce the policy. The cost of bringing up more than one child does not deter many wealthy people, and increased freedom of movement has made it difficult for family planning authorities to track down people if they choose to flout the regulations. One possibility for relaxation is that everyone could be allowed to have up to two children, with a space of at least five years between them. It is thought that this would be acceptable to the majority of people, would help to reduce the excess in male births and would help with the problem of care of the elderly. There are real concerns about what is known as the 4-2-1 phenomenon: families with four grandparents, two parents and one child taking care of them all. But the government feels that vigilance is still essential. It fears that an accelerated increase in population growth could threaten economic growth and stability. There are particular concerns about the increasing level of migration from rural to urban areas, which has fuelled substantial urban growth. So a softly-softly approach is being taken. In most of urban China now, an only child marrying an only child is allowed to have two children. Interestingly, many of the young couples who are now eligible to have two are choosing to have just one child. This is perhaps less surprising when one considers that east Asia boasts some of the lowest fertility rates in the world. (The fertility rate is the average number of children born to each woman, with replacement fertility therefore at around 2.1). Hong Kong has a fertility rate of one, Taiwan 1.1 and Japan 1.3, alongside a figure of 1.6 for China. Another recent change has been that couples no longer need to obtain permission to have a first child. This spelt the end of the very unpopular system of local birth quotas, which meant that couples were forced to delay pregnancy if the local quota was exceeded. These changes, together with declining fertility aspirations, have reduced (though not eliminated) the tensions associated with the government&apos;s efforts to control population growth. The Shanghai government is now considering incentives to encourage couples to have two children. Other city governments may feel the need to follow suit."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/26/ang-lee-life-of-pi", "publicationDate": "2010-10-26T12:01:10Z", "tags": ["Ang Lee", "Film", "Yann Martel", "Books", "Culture", "Booker prize", "Booker prize 2002", "Fiction", "Life of Pi"], "sentences": ["He will start work in January, when Lee plans to start principal photography in Taiwan and India."], "title": "Ang Lee casts unknown teenage actor in Life of Pi", "article": "A previously unknown Indian actor has won the lead role in Ang Lee&apos;s forthcoming big screen adaptation of the bestselling novel Life of Pi, by Yann Martel, reports Variety.

In China to present a statement of friendship signed by nearly 700 British scientists and artists, he was watching a parade that the reporter James Cameron reckoned to be &quot;the greatest show on earth&quot;. First came the troops and the &quot;military ironwork&quot;, grinding past for a full hour. This was followed by a much longer civil parade in which the people marched by in barely imaginable numbers, beaming with joy at their elevated leaders who gazed back with the slightly &quot;subdued&quot; expression of still unaccustomed new emperors. Float after float rolled by, showing model factories and locomotives. Children released balloons and elastic-powered model aeroplanes; the masses united to cry &quot;Down with American imperialism&quot;; and Picasso&apos;s peace dove was everywhere. Having recently migrated from earlier European congresses, this simplified bird appeared to have usurped the traditional dragons of Peking. The spectacle with which China celebrated the fifth anniversary of the communist liberation was brilliantly organised, as Casson felt obliged to admit. He was less impressed by the admiring expressions worn by many of the other international guests: &quot;Gold-rimmed spectacles misted with emotion, cheeks creased with years of well-meant service in this cause or in that, shirts defiantly open at the neck, badges in lapels, and there in the middle \u2013 could it have been? \u2013 an MCC tie.&quot; That particular specimen was Ivor Montagu, a cricket-loving friend and translator of the great Soviet film-maker Sergei Eisenstein. He was also a table tennis champion who preferred &quot;New China&apos;s&quot; disciplined &quot;physical jerks&quot; to the indolence of a capitalist world in which &quot;rich men&quot; disdained even walking as &quot;something you paid those less fortunate to do on your behalf&quot;. And he was by no means alone in his enthusiasm for &quot;New China&quot;. Sickened by the rapture of the communist regime&apos;s ardent western friends, Casson quickly retreated to the shaded &quot;rest room&quot; beneath the viewing stand. Here he lingered among yellow-robed Tibetan lamas, sipping tea and exchanging impressions with other doubtful Britons: the classically minded and no longer Marxist novelist and poet Rex Warner, and AJ Ayer, the high-living logical positivist who would come home to tell the BBC that China&apos;s parade had reminded him of the Nuremberg rallies. They may also have caught a fleeting glimpse of the Marxist crystallographer JD Bernal, who had no MCC tie but was sporting his Stalin prize medal, collected in Moscow on the way to China. Bernal was full of admiration for New China and its celebrations, but as hour followed hour he too descended from the stand to spend a moment &quot;sipping orange juice through a straw&quot; at the same table as the dalai lama. Enraptured or appalled, none of these British witnesses appears to have regretted the absence of Stanley Spencer. The 63-year-old painter, so famously associated with the little Berkshire village of Cookham, had managed to escape the entire show \u2013 thanks, he later explained, to &quot;some Mongolians&quot;, whose timely arrival at the hotel that morning had provided the cover under which he retreated upstairs to his room. It was the discovery that Spencer had been to China that persuaded me to look further into this forgotten episode. I soon realised that an extraordinary assortment of Britons had made their way to China in 1954, including the former prime minister and leader of the Labour Party, Clement Attlee. And all this nearly two decades before 1972, when President Nixon made the stage-managed and \u2013 even before John Adams got hold of it \u2013 distinctly operatic visit that has gone down in history as the moment when the west entered rapprochement with the People&apos;s Republic of China. Were these motley British visitors just credulous idiots, for whom &quot;Red China&quot; was another version of the legendary Cathay? That is what the 24-year-old Douglas Hurd and the other diplomats in the British embassy compound in Peking appear to have suspected of these unwelcome freeloaders. Or was something more significant going on? Nowadays, the rapidly increasing number of British travellers to China think nothing of getting on a plane to fly directly there. Yet Spencer had good reason to feel &quot;trembly&quot; as he and the five other members of his entirely unofficial cultural delegation approached the runway at Heathrow on 14 September 1954. Though Britain had recognised China a few months after the liberation, it had yet to establish proper diplomatic relations with the communist-led government, and the embarking Britons couldn&apos;t pick up a visa until they had reached Prague. That meant crossing the iron curtain dividing Europe. &quot;Did you go under or over it?&quot; one joker would later ask, making light of a passage that was actually more like falling over the edge of the known world. The travellers then had to fly across east Europe, pausing at Minsk and Moscow before heading across Siberia and then Mongolia \u2013 all the time relying on their hosts to finance, accommodate and entertain them, and also to provide the vibrating twin-prop planes in which they would hop to the far side of the world, landing every three hours or so to refuel. &quot;There are bears in there,&quot; Spencer mused, glancing anxiously down into a nameless Soviet forest at a moment when the engine sputtered &quot;Fit! Fit! Fit!&quot; There were troubles at home too. The cold war was entrenched, its dangers exacerbated by the advance of nuclear weaponry on both sides. Britain, meanwhile, was financially straitened, and reliant on loans from America, which demanded adherence to Washington&apos;s hard-line foreign policy including its trade embargoes against Russia and China. Under these circumstances, it was by no means just a handful of disgruntled communists and export-hungry businessmen who yearned to make Britain&apos;s political outlook more independent. The loss of power gave a distinctly anti-American resonance to the patriotic lament of Shakespeare&apos;s John of Gaunt \u2013 that &quot;This England&quot; should ever be &quot;leas&apos;d\u00a0out . . . Like to a tenement, or pelting\u00a0farm&quot;. China remained hostile and isolated behind the recently lowered &quot;bamboo curtain&quot;. Nevertheless, by the beginning of 1954 a thaw had begun to seem possible. Stalin had died in March 1953, and the Korean war had been brought to a ceasefire not long afterwards. There were indications that Moscow and its Chinese ally might be interested in making more than a slogan out of &quot;peaceful coexistence&quot; with the west. It was, however, France&apos;s losing war in the area then known as &quot;French Indo-China&quot; that persuaded many in western Europe to adopt a more optimistic view of &quot;New China&quot; than President Eisenhower&apos;s bomb-wreathed &quot;domino theory&quot; of Asia&apos;s imminent fall to communism. On the morning of Saturday 24 April, the Chinese prime minister and foreign secretary, Zhou Enlai, flew into Geneva from Moscow. He came at the head of a large Chinese delegation to join France, Britain and Russia in a conference aimed at finding a settlement to the Indo-China war. Previously, west Europeans had known the Chinese leader only through anti-communist stereotypes, or the equally partisan hymns of praise issued by witnesses such as Hewlett Johnson, the inordinately optimistic &quot;Red Dean of Canterbury&quot;. But here he now was, anything but a Russian puppet or, for that matter, a primitive &quot;agrarian reformer&quot; of the kind many in the west imagined the Chinese communists to be. Diverse western Europeans were transfixed by the sight of this urbane and highly competent man, smiling into the cameras as he berated America \u2013 which had refused even to take part in the conference \u2013 and demonstrating his abilities as a regional leader by negotiating ceasefires in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Later in the year, James Cameron would describe Zhou as the man who, in the course of his short visit to Geneva, had produced &quot;the simultaneous double-effect&quot; of &quot;a nervous constriction in the diplomatic hearts and a violent sexual impulse in the persons of almost every European woman who clapped eyes on him&quot;. The flights to Peking began shortly after Zhou&apos;s European triumph. From Geneva, as at the Bandung conference the following year, Zhou invited the world to &quot;come and see&quot; what was going on behind the bamboo curtain. And Britons were among those who headed for the airport. The Labour leadership sent the opening delegation. Clement Attlee was at its head, accompanied by various other members of the National Executive Committee, including Aneurin Bevan and his former insurance minister Edith Summerskill. The cultural delegation, which comprised Casson, Warner, Ayer and Spencer, together with the geologist Leonard Hawkes and the young sinologist John Chinnery, followed later in the summer. Like the vague statement of friendship in its luggage, its membership had been decided by people close to the Britain-China Friendship Association, who were careful to come up with a group that could not easily be dismissed as communist fellow travellers. A delegation of Labour councillors and shop stewards was recruited at the last minute and guided, very reluctantly, by the communist &quot;artist-reporter&quot; Paul Hogarth. He had travelled a lot behind the iron curtain and could not now escape responsibility for chaperoning a very &quot;third rate&quot; Labour delegation whose members, as he told me, cared nothing for China new or old, and wanted only to get drunk at somebody else&apos;s expense. A more senior delegation of Labour MPs, including Barbara Castle, William Griffiths and various other &quot;Bevanites&quot; who had come into the Commons in the 1945 landslide, delayed its departure until early October so that its members could attend the Labour party conference, where they had joined Bevan in objecting, unsuccessfully, to Attlee&apos;s support of cold war policies. There were indeed some pilgrims among the travellers, who saw what they and China&apos;s presenters wanted them to see \u2013 docilely imbibing tea and statistics, smiling back at children in model nurseries, and sensing only a bright cooperative future in fields fertilised with the blood of murdered landlords. But the Attlee delegation was not like that. Its members had fought their own battles against communism in Britain, and they had been well briefed before leaving. They had also been given a detailed anticipation of the &quot;show&quot; they should expect from a collection of Chinese teachers, editors and intellectuals who had moved to Hong Kong. They liked the new marriage laws, the apparent abolition of prostitution, and also the new public health campaigns. As in Moscow, they were, perhaps, a little discomforted as they compared their own achievements while in government in Britain with China&apos;s prodigious construction of factories, mines, housing, schools and hospitals. They stood up to Mao over tea, deplored the regime&apos;s failure to do anything about the booming birth-rate and also criticised the communist-led government for imposing an absurdly distorted idea of the west on their people. If China really believed that the masses in the west sympathised with communism, and were only held down by an evil ruling class, then they might blunder into another war. Even those with strong communist loyalties tried to reduce China&apos;s exclusive reliance on the USSR. Thus, while JD Bernal was known for his mistaken support for the &quot;proletarian science&quot; of the bogus geneticist Trofim\u00a0Lysenko, he certainly did not spend his many lectures trying to convince New China&apos;s scientists to rely on such Soviet\u00a0models, arguing throughout for\u00a0a renewed exchange between Chinese scientists and their colleagues in the west. It was a similar situation with the artists Paul Hogarth and Denis Mathews. They were both happy to celebrate the liberation and the ongoing reconstruction of China. And yet they were also united in their opposition to the idea that Soviet socialist realism offered an adequate model for the future development of Chinese art. They argued this point forcefully with the artists who welcomed them and accompanied them around the country. Both insisted that it would be far better to consider the new forms of figuration pioneered by Picasso and Guttuso in western Europe. Meanwhile, confusion as well as unexpected light followed from the visitors&apos; habit of applying British analogies to Chinese realities. Attlee himself praised New China&apos;s still expanding network of cooperatives, seeing in them the principle of &quot;voluntary action&quot; that William Beveridge had insisted was the necessary attendant to the welfare state. The national secretary of the Women&apos;s Cooperative Guild, Mabel Ridealgh, likened China&apos;s extensive cooperatives to those of her own organisation and joined Castle in comparing China&apos;s food distribution system to the Co-op in Britain. Earlier post-liberation visitors had already set about Englishing the new Chinese scene. &quot;It&apos;s the same in Marylebone High Street,&quot; the veteran actor Miles Malleson had remarked in 1953: he was thinking of New China&apos;s appetite for dramas with a contemporary message. Basil Davidson had reserved a different English comparison for a communist group leader in the southern city of Canton. Aware of what the regime&apos;s critics said about such watchful cadres, he insisted that she was &quot;as much a spy on her 50 families as the chairman of my parish council, in rural Essex, is a spy on me&quot;. Hogarth was merely continuing in this line when he declared arriving in Shanghai to be like &quot;pulling into Manchester from Sheffield&quot;, while Hangchow (Hangzhou) was like &quot;a South Coast English seaside resort whose better days lay at the beginning of the century&quot;. He found a more original English line on China&apos;s revolutionary art. Visiting the Lu Xun museum in Shanghai, he enjoyed the discovery that those stark woodcuts, designed to galvanise illiterate peasants into action against both the Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s reactionary nationalists, were descended from leafy English scenes portrayed by such far from revolutionary artists as Gwen Raverat, Robert Gibbings and Edward Bawden. There was a characteristically English way of looking at China&apos;s notoriously bloody &quot;agrarian reform&quot; too. In 1949, Mao had famously proclaimed that the Chinese people had at last &quot;stood up&quot;, and Hogarth was happy to confirm that claim. His drawing of a &quot;Shansi peasant&quot; shows a man standing very upright indeed: clasping the wooden hayfork that rises next to his head, he stares back with a resolute expression that is neither cringing nor deferential. Made in the field, as was this determined artist-reporter&apos;s way, Hogarth&apos;s drawing evokes an English analogy already employed by Joseph Needham, Davidson and other visitors \u2013 the English Diggers and Levellers of the 17th century, who had torn down fences and set to work digging up the commons land stolen from them under the new Enclosure Acts. It was at once an evasive strategy and a concerted attempt to assert an English tradition uncompromised by a mutually hated British imperialism. Yet it was Spencer who raised the art of being English in New China to its strangest heights. Twenty years earlier, he had recorded the desire to write the story of his life as if it were a wandering &quot;journey to China&quot;, and he had no sooner landed at the airfield outside Peking than he started peering around in startled recognition: &quot;As I drove along the roads from the airports to the towns it was almost comic to see these dreams of mine coming true on either side of the road.&quot; Other delegates cringed as he harassed the guides at various historical sites with peculiar offscript questions, and tormented helpless waiters with requests for fish and chips. As for New China&apos;s artists, Spencer had no prescriptions to offer about socialist realism. Instead he informed his audience at the Central Academy of Fine Arts that he was &quot;possibly the most marvellous visitor to China they had ever had&quot;. He ventured that his visit was &quot;something on a par with the coming of Buddha&quot;, later explaining that he had felt obliged to emphasise this fact &quot;because in England if people don&apos;t know who I am I am at once called upon to carry heavy suitcases&quot;. Britain&apos;s horrified charg\u00e9 d&apos;affaires in Peking, Humphrey Trevelyan, avoided that particular occasion but could not escape the &quot;fatuous performance&quot; in which Spencer, Ayer, Warner, Casson and Hawkes, the leader of the cultural delegation, presented their statement of friendship to the minister of culture, Kuo Mo-jo, a man whose purpose was so obviously to &quot;exploit the word &apos;peace&apos; for political ends&quot;. Trevelyan was particularly dismayed to hear Spencer &quot;guilelessly expatiating&quot; about &quot;the delights of Formosa&quot;. For Trevelyan, as for Kuo Mo-jo and his colleagues, Formosa was the American-buoyed nationalist island that the communist slogans fiercely insisted was really China&apos;s Taiwan. And now here was Spencer blundering on without ever really making it clear that the &quot;Formosa&quot; in his mind was actually a little island in the Thames at Cookham, with a creek, a picturesque old house, and a field in which the local Boy Scouts held their musters. Judging from the notes he wrote after returning home, Spencer made very short work of the Great Wall of China too. Indeed, he reduced it to the garden wall along which he had liked to walk as a child in Cookham. He had, as he explained, climbed up by the coal cellar and triumphed over many challenges as he made his way along its length: not the advancing Manchu army, but the leaning lid of the dustbin, the ivy that stretched over some sections, and the protruding branches of cherry, yew and fir that also had to be negotiated over that wall&apos;s rather less than 4,000 mile length. Spencer \u2013 who told Zhou that &quot;I feel at home in China because I feel that Cookham is somewhere near, only just around the corner&quot; \u2013 was uniquely idiosyncratic, but he was by no means the only delegate who seems to have journeyed to the far side of the world without ever really leaving England behind. As for the future of this attempted rapprochement between Britain and &quot;New China&quot;, the optimistic &quot;spirit of Geneva&quot; evaporated soon enough after the last delegates came home, and the blocs quickly refroze. Yet that moment of hopefulness was not entirely without consequences. Trade between Britain and China was renewed over the years to come, diplomatic relations were established, and cultural exchanges did develop. The Bevanite perspective within the Labour party cannot be said to have thrived, but the insistence on maintaining an independent British stance towards Washington was alive in the 60s, when Harold Wilson refused to commit British forces to America&apos;s war in Vietnam. Though insufficient to restrain Tony Blair from joining Bush&apos;s invasion of Iraq, it did continue to resound in the heartfelt declamations that the elderly Barbara Castle used to launch against various New Labour policies during her last years in the House of Lords. She informed me in no uncertain terms that the true delinquents of 1954 were those in power who refused to rise to the opportunities of the moment, and certainly not those like herself who went to China with the aim of lifting the bamboo curtain. Of the British artists who went to China in 1954, neither Spencer nor Hogarth would ever return. Mathews, however, would try to maintain the dialogue even as China went through the suppression of the Hundred Flowers campaign, the collectivisation of the briefly &quot;cooperative&quot; economy, and the monstrously costly &quot;Great Leap Forward&quot;. He used his position as secretary of the Contemporary Art Society at the Tate Gallery to promote an exchange of exhibitions. Working directly with Chinese government agencies, he began by organising a survey show of British Graphic Art, which was taken to China by his fellow organiser and artist Richard Carline in 1955. He himself returned in 1960, accompanying an exhibition of recent paintings entitled Sixty Years of British Painting in Oils. He found China to be a very different place. Discussion was discouraged, the circulation of the show was curtailed, and he was prevented from renewing his acquaintance with some of the Chinese artists he had got to know in 1954.

This is crap organisation!&quot; &quot;Keep it sane!&quot; a fellow rally-goer shouted in response.  &quot;No, no yeah, you&apos;re right\u2026 Thank you!&quot; the woman responded, suitably embarrassed that she had broken the rally&apos;s code of moderate, respectful behaviour. \u00a0The calmness of the crowd \u2013 having braved packed Metro trains or hour-long walks from Virginia to the capital \u2013 was startling: people were clapping along to muffled songs and laughing at jokes they could barely hear, straining to catch a glimpse of the stage or even one of the giant screens. Taller men moved so that the vertically-challenged could have a fleeting glance of Jon Stewart himself or take a picture. It was heartening, almost as heartening as the concept of a rally populated by political moderates in a country so frequently dominated by vociferous extremists. \u00a0Jon Stewart&apos;s Rally to Restore Sanity was attended by overwhelming numbers, with spectators climbing up portable toilets and trees to catch a glimpse of the main event. Among them were the predictable suspects: anti-Tea Partiers and a plethora of groups championing every &quot;liberal&quot; cause imaginable, from pro-choice to legalising marijuana. There were even anarchist groups in evidence, calling for revolution (over inaction) as the only &quot;sane&quot; course to take. \u00a0But for the most part, the rally was perhaps exactly as Jon Stewart would have intended; filled with calm, independent, vaguely political yuppies, moderate progressives and, of course, leftwing liberals. If Chris Lander&apos;s Stuff White People Like came to life, it would look like this. There was a distinct sense of irony about the entire affair; a rally held by a semi-journalistic satirical comedian, the weekend before the midterm elections, aiming to be anti-political. Rather than just being a party for progressives, however, the sheer diversity of the crowd&apos;s demographics, united mostly by their love for the Stewart/Colbert pairing, indicated it could be something more. When a young woman on the giant screens at the rally said she was from Taiwan, a man yelled, &quot;Taiwan! Yeah! We support your existence!&quot; \u00a0For many, this was their first political rally of any kind. For Ramon d&apos;Immensio, 69, who describes himself as &quot;almost a socialist, but not quite there\u2026 light pink, maybe&quot;, this was about trying to make a quiet statement against the Republicans. &quot;They live in a fantasy world. Everything the Republicans are doing is putting us at risk.&quot; He carried a sign that said &quot;Stupid is a choice\u2026 Often a lifestyle,&quot; but said he had never done anything overtly political before this. \u00a0For a few hours, despite the crowds politely pushing their way through, the anti-Fox News banners, the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch-wearing preppy college kids and the colourful Halloween costumes, everything seemed surreal but serene. But beneath the placards, clapping and laughter was a deep, genuine desire for some sort of alternative to the current shouting-match in the Capitol and all over the media.  At some point between the rendition of the Star Spangled Banner and Jon Stewart&apos;s closing speech calling for optimism, perspective and humour, one could almost feel hopeful about the direction in which political life in America is heading.\u00a0Until Tuesday, of course."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/02/aviva-closes-final-salary-scheme-cost-cutting", "publicationDate": "2010-11-02T13:42:00Z", "tags": ["Aviva", "Insurance industry", "Business", "Pensions", "Money"], "sentences": ["Aviva, Britain&apos;s second-largest insurance group, is selling its Taiwan business and hinted at further disposals to focus on the UK and Europe.", "Aviva announced today it would sell its \u00a313m business in Taiwan \u2013 mirroring Prudential&apos;s withdrawal from the country last year \u2013 and there could be &quot;one or two&quot; further disposals."], "title": "Aviva targets \u00a3400m of savings in cost-cutting drive", "article": "Aviva, Britain&apos;s second-largest insurance group, is selling its Taiwan business and hinted at further disposals to focus on the UK and Europe. It is also cutting several hundred jobs in Canada and shutting its final salary pension scheme as part of efforts to save \u00a3400m. The news came as Aviva unveiled better-than-expected pension and life sales, which rose 6% to \u00a325.6bn in the first nine months of this year. Last year, nine-month sales fell 11% in the wake of the financial crisis. Total sales worldwide climbed 5% to \u00a335.9bn. General insurance and health net written premiums were 4% ahead at \u00a37.3bn this year. &quot;As we look to the next phase of our growth, Aviva will sharpen its geographic focus and deepen its position in its key markets through its strengths in both life and general insurance,&quot; said chief executive Andrew Moss. Aviva announced today it would sell its \u00a313m business in Taiwan \u2013 mirroring Prudential&apos;s withdrawal from the country last year \u2013 and there could be &quot;one or two&quot; further disposals. Unlike competitors such as Prudential who are chasing growth in Asia, Aviva will continue to focus on the UK and Europe, the largest life and pensions market in the world which it said offers the greatest absolute growth over the next five years. Moss also ruled out acquisitions in the US. &quot;Geographic expansion now seems to be on the back burner,&quot; said Raghu Hariharan at Citi. &quot;The non-life business seems to be on an improving trend ... especially in the UK. While this remains an attractive story, we believe that Aviva would need to engage in disposals of unattractive businesses to reduce leverage which would help drive more comfort around its ability to pay a full cash dividend.&quot; Aviva plans to take out \u00a3200m in costs and deliver another \u00a3200m in efficiency gains by the end of 2012. Of the \u00a3200m savings, half will come from the UK, including \u00a350m from the closure of the final salary pension scheme, first announced in April. Some 7,600 people are affected by this and can join the insurer&apos;s money purchase scheme instead from 1 April 2011. This is set to further reduce the pension deficit, which is estimated to have fallen to \u00a32.1bn in March from \u00a33bn in March 2009. About 14,000 UK staff are already members of the money purchase scheme. The insurer is laying off &quot;a few hundred&quot; staff in Canada, where it employs 3,300 people, and there will also be job cuts in the US, while the UK will not see any job losses. The measures will reduce the group&apos;s cost base to below \u00a35bn by the end of next year, from \u00a35.75bn in 2007. Moss once again confirmed Aviva&apos;s commitment to running the life and general insurance businesses together. In the summer, the group rebuffed a \u00a35bn bid for its general insurance operations in the UK, Ireland and Canada from rival RSA. &quot;We have a unique competitive strength in the UK market in that we&apos;re excellent providers of both life and general insurance,&quot; he said today. &quot;There are benefits for us from running both businesses \u2013 there are synergies in terms of human resources, technology, branding, marketing and advertising which work positively for us.&quot; He noted that the group can hold 30-40% less capital than it would on a standalone basis. The general insurance business tends to generate cash in the short term, which is consumed by life operations that make returns over a longer timescale. RSA questioned whether the composite model is best for Aviva, suggesting it could be broken up. Moss did not rule out the possibility of a sale of the general insurance arm. &quot;Of course there is a price at which we on the board of Aviva would entertain an offer for any of our businesses but it would have to provide the right value for Aviva&apos;s shareholders.&quot; In the UK, total sales improved by 16% to \u00a312.3bn, long-term savings sales grew 22% to \u00a38.9bn, and life and pension sales climbed 15% to \u00a37.6bn.

Just three days after getting the worst drubbing of his career, Barack Obama flew off for a 10-day spin around Asia that encompasses India, Indonesia, Japan and South Korea. There is a G20 summit thrown in, and Obama is bringing 200 business leaders, so he can argue that the trip is all about drumming up orders for US jobs. Indian investment alone accounts for 75,000 of those. Even so, he is either one cool dude or he has still not got the message. No one is quite sure which. Under the constitution, the president both has the initiative and plays the predominant role in foreign policy. The international stage is the only one in which he can be relatively free of a Republican veto. But this freedom is relative. A pro-Israeli Cuban-American is taking over the chairmanship of the house foreign affairs committee, which will surely cheer Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. There could be problems ahead in the Senate over an important treaty which the president has already signed with Russia, the strategic arms reduction treaty. Some of the more cold-war minded Republicans could put an oar in here too, claiming the treaty limits anti-missile deployments. Perhaps paradoxically, Mr Obama needs to be at home just to safeguard his foreign agenda. But the fact that Mr Obama and David Cameron will be in India and China respectively next week with posses of businessmen in tow speaks volumes about who needs whom in today&apos;s world. US trade with India is more balanced than it is with China, even though it is only a fraction of it. But Delhi is just as troubled by America&apos;s superpower role. For his part, Mr Obama is not about to reverse Washington&apos;s support for Pakistan&apos;s military, nor change his plans to begin withdrawing from Afghanistan next year, neither of which India likes. The US president will stay at the Taj hotel in Mumbai, where 31 people died in the terror attacks in November 2008, which is an important gesture. But in the end presidential trips are about pushing hard strategic interests, not Harley-Davidsons. The arrival of the American president in Japan and South Korea comes when the waters of the East China Sea are choppy. China, Taiwan, Russia and South Korea all have leadership changes next year, and North Korea is in the process of one transition already. It is a zone where there are at least two active territorial disputes, and plenty of ocean in which boats can collide and nationalist mischief be engineered for domestic electoral gain. The Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan, and the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, have only just met to repair the damage done by the arrest of a Chinese fishing boat captain by a Japanese coastguard. The incident caused weeks of anti-Japanese demonstrations and a shutdown in the export of rare earth minerals to Japan. It took the threat of a reference to the WTO before the exports resumed. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, denied recently that the US was seeking to contain the projection of Chinese power in the region, but that is exactly what at least 10 members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations want the US to do. Barely had the Chinese fishing boat captain been released when the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, popped up in the Kurils (the site of a dispute between Moscow and Tokyo). Senior Japanese analysts interpreted this as a Russian diplomatic gift to China. Try as modern leaders do to talk about capital inflows, trade balances and exchange rates, they are just as anxious about keeping national influence, and for this the diplomatic presence of the US in the region is needed as never before. It may do him no good in Ohio, but it is important that Mr Obama sees for himself how the world&apos;s engine of growth \u2013 for that is what India and Asia now are \u2013 is running."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/nov/08/obama-us-dominance-asia-over", "publicationDate": "2010-11-08T21:30:00Z", "tags": ["Barack Obama", "India", "Malaysia", "Indonesia", "China", "US foreign policy", "World news", "US news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Politically damaged Thailand as well as Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan have recovered from the downturn.", "Asian fears of China&apos;s rise, which the United States keenly monitors, look minor beside the fact that China is now the largest export market for Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, in addition to being India&apos;s biggest trading partner."], "title": "Obama, the street kid from Jakarta, knows US dominance of Asia is over | Pankaj Mishra", "article": "Barack Obama has embarked on his tour of four Asian countries (India, Indonesia, South Korea, and Japan); and you might expect him to have a full foreign-policy agenda. Relations between Japan and China have deteriorated sharply following the Japanese seizure of a Chinese fishing boat. South Korea, another stalwart American client, has much to fear from the political transitions of its mysterious neighbour. India and Indonesia also present some complex strategic challenges. The dispute in Kashmir, which Obama identified as among his &quot;critical tasks&quot; in 2008, clearly saps Pakistan&apos;s commitment to America&apos;s war in Afghanistan. After two cancelled trips to Indonesia, Obama finally has the chance this week to commemorate his childhood in the country, and to re-engage his audience in the Muslim world that he first addressed in Cairo in 2009. However, Obama insists on defining his mission in Asia in less than lofty terms. &quot;We need to find,&quot; he wrote in an op-ed last week in the New York Times, &quot;new customers in new markets for American-made goods.&quot; This article, which went on about trade pacts with South Korea, Indonesia&apos;s chairmanship of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), and the importance of creating thousands of American jobs, had not a word to say about the political and military role of the United States in Asia. Visiting India, Obama has remained on message, talking about business deals and American jobs. He may be feeling a bit chastened after the setbacks in US midterm elections last week. Certainly he must stem growing unemployment as well as stimulate an economic recovery if he hopes to win a second term as president in 2012. And he may be trying to avoid the impression of being too preoccupied with abstruse foreign policy issues. Still, Obama&apos;s geopolitical diffidence acknowledges an undeniable fact: that America, weakened by the recession and successive military-diplomatic failures, can no longer dictate the course of events in Asia \u2013 a power it exercised, with often devastating effect, throughout the cold war. The oft-repeated story of China&apos;s rise is only part of the explanation for this. More importantly, mass politicisation and economic regionalism have emboldened many Asian countries that previously followed America&apos;s lead or cowered in its long shadow. There is probably no American politician more aware of this impalpable but dramatic turnaround than Obama, who lived on a mud lane in Jakarta in the late 1960s, and visited Pakistan and India as a student in 1981. He came of age when the United States still wore the mantle it had inherited from European empires in the east; and many American officials, politicians and intellectuals dreamed, as Lawrence of Arabia once had, &quot;of hustling into form \u2026 the new Asia which time was inexorably bringing upon us&quot;. Two years before the six-year-old Obama moved with his mother to Jakarta, the CIA colluded in the killing, by military and paramilitary Muslim groups, of nearly half a million suspected communists in Indonesia. Indonesia during General Suharto&apos;s long New Order (1967-1998) became a perfect client of the United States. There were always high-class intellectual justifications available for crony capitalism and military brutality of the kind Suharto specialised in. In 1968 Samuel Huntington published Political Order in Changing Societies, which in terms of political effect seems more influential \u2013 and malign \u2013 than The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of the Political Order. Pro-American despots from Suharto to South Korea&apos;s Park Chung-hee and the Shah of Iran took careful note of Huntington&apos;s emphasis on the utmost necessity of political stability and military modernisation. Another beneficiary of the American preference for sturdy anti-Communism over messy democracy was Pakistan&apos;s General Zia-ul-Haq. In 1954, the year Pakistan along with Turkey and Iran was drafted into the cold war, the great Urdu writer Saadat Hasan Manto addressed &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; in a series of satirical (and prophetic) letters. &quot;Dear Uncle,&quot; he wrote, &quot;you are seriously concerned about the stability of the world&apos;s largest Islamic state since our Mullah is the best antidote to Russian communism.&quot; By 1981, the year Obama visited Pakistan, Zia had persuaded the United States that global jihad was the correct response to monolithic communism. Of course, none of the political and economic arrangements frozen during the cold war were destined to last; and they melted in their own way, often causing a more extensive chaos than the one Huntington feared. Mass revolts finally unseated Suharto, plunging Indonesia into a turbulent period of democratisation. General Zia departed mysteriously in a plane crash; but the religious-political passions he unleashed are still with us, partly feeding on the cruel injustices of Pakistan&apos;s feudal society that Obama witnessed on his visit to the country. The military may have been forced out of politics in Indonesia. In Pakistan it still slyly fattens itself on feckless American aid. Indeed, Pakistani military and intelligence have refined their money-extraction ruses into an art form even as popular sentiment in Pakistan turns overwhelmingly against the United States. But then, as Manto put it to Uncle Sam: &quot;I am your Pakistani nephew and I know your moves. Everyone can now become a smartass, thanks to your style of playing politics.&quot; Almost everywhere in Asia, the United States finds itself distrusted, outmanoeuvered and encircled, by present allies (Pakistan, Karzai) as well as erstwhile proteges. Decades after getting rid of the shah, Iran&apos;s rulers can still draw upon strong anti-western passions as it bankrolls its proxies and friends in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as Lebanon and Gaza. The politicians and businessmen of Japan and South Korea can barely keep a lid on mass opposition to America&apos;s lingering cold war presence in the region. Malaysia, from where I write, consistently &quot;looked east&quot; for its economic growth in the last three decades. Here, the east Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 stigmatised American policies long before the &quot;Washington consensus&quot; received its final rites elsewhere. The shrinking of American influence is apparent even in India, whose political and business elites adore US wealth and power with an embarrassing intensity. (&quot;The people of India,&quot; Manmohan Singh, the prime minister, blurted out to George Bush, &quot;love you!&quot;) India remained as protective of its farmers as ever at the stalled Doha round of talks. The Bush administration&apos;s generous gift of a nuclear deal has not made India much more hospitable to American investors and exporters. As Obama will find out, India has many more likely and rewarding partners in booming Asia than in the recession-hit west. Politically damaged Thailand as well as Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan have recovered from the downturn. Last year India signed a major free-trade deal with Asean. Not surprisingly a columnist in the Star, Malaysia&apos;s leading newspaper in English, deemed the Indian prime minister&apos;s visit to Kuala Lumpur last week more important than the jaunt of Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, to the region at the same time. A tangle of bilateral trade agreements underpins Asia&apos;s new economic unity. China and Asean countries already constitute the biggest free-trade zone in the world. Asian fears of China&apos;s rise, which the United States keenly monitors, look minor beside the fact that China is now the largest export market for Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, in addition to being India&apos;s biggest trading partner. All this sounds a planet away from those Tea-Partying Americans who think that the US can bomb its way out of any political and economic difficulties abroad. It now falls to Obama to advance their education; and he&apos;ll most likely fail in this thankless task. But it can&apos;t be said that this president, once a street kid in Jakarta, didn&apos;t try, or that he ever imagined he could hustle into form the new and intractable Asia."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/nov/08/art-auction-records-broken-billionaire", "publicationDate": "2010-11-08T21:51:47Z", "tags": ["The art market", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "New York", "US news", "World news"], "sentences": ["Gorvy says the numbers of collectors from Hong Kong, Taiwan and China &quot;increased dramatically&quot; over the past two years."], "title": "Art auction records broken by new breed of billionaires", "article": "By the end of this week, New York will have come to the end of a fortnight of impressionist and contemporary art sales at its main auction houses. Already, the auction record for a Modigliani has been broken. By Thursday, if the sales reach expectations, \u00a31bn will have been spent. For ordinary mortals \u2013 those dealing with the bleak everyday challenges of recession on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 the prices are staggering. How come, when our own economy is struggling through the deepest downturn since the second world war, the art market seems to have wriggled out of the crash of 2008 and auction houses are mounting what one expert calls &quot;ambitious, pumping, thrusting&quot; sales? After last week&apos;s impressionist sales, it is the turn of contemporary art to go under the hammer. At Christie&apos;s, Campbell&apos;s Soup Can With Can Opener by Andy Warhol is among the star turns, estimated at $30-50m (\u00a318m-\u00a330m). Sotheby&apos;s has a Coca-Cola bottle canvas by him at $20-25m. The answer, or part of it, is that the very top of the art market is semi-detached from the movements of individual economies. Rather, it is bound up with the tastes and choices of a number of super-rich people in Europe and America \u2013 and, increasingly, Russia, China and the Middle East. As Brett Gorvy, deputy chairman of Christie&apos;s, put it: &quot;The market is not reliant on one single economy at any one time.&quot; In pockets, at least, the very rich are spending on luxuries \u2013 a category into which contemporary art arguably falls \u2013 without apparent restraint. In Hong Kong this month, Sotheby&apos;s held an auction of fine wine that saw an Asian buyer purchase three bottles of 1869 Ch\u00e2teau Lafite for $232,000 each, a new record. Even more surprisingly, cases of wine that retail for $17,000 in New York were selling at the auction for $70,000. Meanwhile, the tastes of Chinese, Russian and Middle Eastern billionaires are increasingly embracing contemporary art. One of the stars of tomorrow&apos;s Christie&apos;s sale \u2013 estimated at $40m, over double its previous saleroom record of $16.3m \u2013 is a Roy Lichtenstein titled Ohhh ... Alright ... The painting shows a beautiful red-headed woman, telephone receiver cradled to her cheek, thought-bubble drifting from her temple. &quot;It&apos;s not too racy,&quot; said Sarah Thornton, art market expert and author of Seven Days in the Art World. &quot;So it could easily go the Middle East. And it&apos;s totally palatable to the Asian and Russian markets, where figurative work is preferred. It seems the taste for pretty girls is fairly universal.&quot; This month blue chip London galleries, such as White Cube and Timothy Taylor, travelled to the Abu Dhabi art fair to sell to their growing numbers of Middle Eastern clients. Abu Dhabi&apos;s rising appetite for western art of all kinds is evidenced by the development of Saadiyat Island, a new cultural district in which branches of the Louvre and Guggenheim museums are planned to open by 2014. Thornton has noticed a trend among the emerging super-rich. &quot;They tend to start by collecting art of their own nations, whether Middle Eastern, Russian or Chinese. But \u2013 perhaps as their own businesses become global businesses \u2013 their predilections shift towards contemporary art.&quot; Having the &quot;right&quot; contemporary art is a totem of a certain kind of lifestyle, a badge of elite wealth. Gorvy says the numbers of collectors from Hong Kong, Taiwan and China &quot;increased dramatically&quot; over the past two years. It was partly because of its international nature, spanning many economies at once, that the art market recovered from its big dip of late 2008 (in the wake of the collapse of Lehmann Brothers) faster than most had expected. &quot;It took six months, and people expected it to be four to five years,&quot; said Gorvy. The speed of recovery itself breeds confidence, so that sellers who had been anxious to consign works of art to the saleroom two years ago are now returning to the market. There is, nonetheless, a different feel to the auction rooms than there was mid-decade. Speculation on new names is down; tried and tested artists with impeccable records are on the up. Amanda Sharp is cofounder of Frieze art fair, London&apos;s most important annual selling event for contemporary art, and a barometer of the market as a whole. Though last month&apos;s fair was &quot;in the main good&quot;, the market was certainly &quot;much slower than the extreme times of 2006&quot;. She added: &quot;In 2008 there was fear in the air. Last year, you felt galleries had made tough decisions, rolled up their sleeves and carried on. This year it felt like the panic had gone. There was a post-bling feel to it, and most galleries were showing considered and restrained displays.&quot; There also practical reasons for buying art. At a time of economic uncertainty, art is a hedge against currency fluctuation. &quot;If you buy a property in Mayfair, you will always have to sell it in pounds,&quot; said Thornton. &quot;If you buy art, its value will be in whatever denomination you choose, depending on where you choose to put it on the block.&quot; Arguably, the art market has something in common with the gold market, which is bouncing at the moment, with prices topping $1,400 an ounce last week. Art, like gold, is tangible \u2013 not a stock or a share, or complex derivative that cannot be physically embodied. &quot;I spoke to a gentleman the other day,&quot; said Gorvy. &quot;He bought a painting for $5m in 2008 and it&apos;s now worth $6m. Whereas many of his shares are worth nothing at all.&quot; Pop artLike gold, a very instant message According to Brett Gorvy, deputy chairman of Christie&apos;s, the top of the contemporary art market is &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;focused on quality&quot;. He explained: &quot;There is no difference from the move to buying gold, in a way: people are being drawn to things whose value is tried and tested.&quot; Whereas the boom up to 2006 and 2007 saw speculation on new names, buyers are now attracted to 20th-century art history. &quot;Pop is the overriding movement at the moment,&quot; said Gorvy. &quot;Warhol is huge, and Lichtenstein is globally popular.&quot; The star of Christie&apos;s New York sale is a Roy Lichtenstein canvas. The star at Sotheby&apos;s is a Coca-Cola bottle by Andy Warhol with an estimate of $20m-$25m. Part of the point is that pop art can transcend cultural boundaries and appeal to an international audience; the art embodies clear, simple messages. &quot;It is very instant in terms of understanding,&quot; said Gorvy. Jeff Koons, whose Balloon Flower (Blue), pictured left, will be one of the Christie&apos;s evening sale highlights with an estimate of $12m-$16m, is a popular, blue-chip name, as is Richard Prince. So is Gerhard Richter, one of whose candle paintings, Zwei Kerzen (1982) is to come under the hammer this week also estimated at $12m-$16m. Mark Rothko makes appearances at both Sotheby&apos;s and Christie&apos;s this week, with his yellow and white 1955 painting Untitled estimated at $20m-$30m at Sotheby&apos;s. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 November 2010.

The Ha\u00e7ienda and two other Manchester projects for Factory, the Dry 201 bar and the label&apos;s headquarters, had a deeply radical influence on the discipline of interior design. Although now demolished, the Ha\u00e7ienda is still used by design students as a case study. Joining the museum designers MET Studio in 1991, Sandra brought a fresh and gutsy rawness to exhibition design. She introduced a much-needed sense of architectural rigour to the projects, making one think differently about telling stories spatially, as witnessed by her work on the Water Gallery for the National Museum of Science and Industry in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. In 1995, she and I worked together on a commission to convert L&apos;Olympic, a cinema dating from 1927 in Nantes, France, into a club and venue. Sandra finally settled at the design practice Johnson Naylor in London, where she was a powerful creative force. Always drawing on her deep interest in the visual arts (she couldn&apos;t walk past Tate Modern without running in for a look), she worked on a huge range of projects. Sandra was born in Crawley, West Sussex, and educated at Rochester grammar school, followed by a foundation course at Canterbury College of Art. We met on the interior design course at Kingston Polytechnic (now Kingston University), Surrey, in 1979.

Sandra had a wonderful knack of making friends, who loved her great sense of fun, her vivaciousness, her courage and her spirited ability to hold an opinion on just about anything.

The wide scope of commercial problems posed by growing pressure on global water supplies and changing weather patterns is revealed by a survey of the 302 biggest companies in the most water-intensive sectors, across 25 countries. The study was commissioned by the increasingly influential Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which conducts an annual study of what companies are doing to measure and reduce greenhouse gas emissions on behalf of investors holding US$16trillion (\u00a39.9tr) of assets. About half the companies responded to the water survey, of whom 39% said they were already experiencing &quot;detrimental impacts&quot;. In answer to a separate question, about half said the risks to their businesses were &quot;current or near term&quot; - in the next one to five years - a sample likely to have significant crossover with those already reporting problems. Companies most at risk are in the food and drink, tobacco, and metals and mining sectors, says the first CDP Water Disclosure report. Other concerns listed were fines and litigation for pollution. Marcus Norton, who headed the report, said companies that replied to the survey were more likely to have taken action to address water issues affecting their business, but he was still &quot;impressed&quot; by the replies: 96% were aware of potential problems, and two-thirds have somebody responsible for water issues at board or executive committee level. Of the companies which did not reply, not all would be ignoring the problems, but Norton hoped in following years more companies would show they take the issue &quot;seriously&quot;. &quot;I don&apos;t think this is an issue of the price of water increasing even 10-fold, which I think in many cases it will,&quot; he added. &quot;For me it&apos;s about building resilience to and avoiding catastrophic damage from water scarcity and physical risks. If you run out of water you can&apos;t operate. We have seen floods in China and Pakistan cause hundreds of billions of dollars of damage.&quot; Companies that ignore water dangers &quot;pose a risk to investments&quot;, said Anne Kvam, head of corporate governance of Norges Bank Investment Management, a lead sponsor of the report. The report, written by London-based consultancy Environmental Resource Management, names six companies showing &quot;best practice&quot; as mining giant Anglo American, consumer group Colgate-Palmolive, auto maker Ford, US utility PG&amp;E, and engineers GE and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. This was not intended to suggest the named corporations were the top six, only that subjectively they were &quot;good examples&quot;, said Norton. A major report, Charting Our Water Future, commissioned by Nestl\u00e9 and brewer SAB Miller among others last year, calculated by 2030 global water demand would outstrip supply by 40%, with shortages in some parts of the world much more severe than others, but also claimed existing management and technology could cut water use and boost supply enough to close the gap. Nestl\u00e9 chairman, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, previously warned water is a greater threat than climate change, and called for significant rises in water prices to pressure big users to be more efficient."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/nov/15/edinburgh-festival-2011-eastern-flavour", "publicationDate": "2010-11-15T00:05:04Z", "tags": ["Edinburgh festival 2011", "Edinburgh festival", "Festivals", "Culture", "Edinburgh", "Scotland", "UK news"], "sentences": ["The programme will also feature work from India, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, and performances by western artists influenced by eastern traditions and techniques, said festival director Jonathan Mills."], "title": "Edinburgh festival 2011 to have an eastern flavour", "article": "A &quot;heady and intoxicating&quot; season of opera, ballet and classical music from some of Asia&apos;s most acclaimed companies will dominate next year&apos;s Edinburgh international festival.

The programme will also feature work from India, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, and performances by western artists influenced by eastern traditions and techniques, said festival director Jonathan Mills.

Mills said the Chinese national ballet and Shanghai Peking opera productions were made possible by &quot;substantial&quot; financial support from China&apos;s government, which last week hosted a major UK trade mission led by David Cameron. Festival officials said that, coincidentally, Mills is in China as a guest of the country&apos;s culture ministry to give lectures on the importance of arts festivals for medium-sized cities, and to support a VisitBritain mission to boost Chinese tourism to the UK. Visits by Chinese tourists are expected to double by 2014, and Mills hopes that visitors to the London Olympics in 2012 and the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014 will be persuaded to detour to see the Edinburgh festivals. These links underscore Mills&apos; increasing reliance on foreign sources to fund his programme as UK arts organisations face increasingly tight public and private sector spending. The 2010 festival received \u00a34.7m in grants from domestic sources, but shows were also funded by Australian, German, Spanish and Mexican partners. After bankrolling an unparalleled increase in subsidies to the festivals since 2007, the Scottish finance secretary John Swinney is expected to unveil cuts of at least 10% in direct support for the arts when he announces the Scottish government&apos;s budget this week.

Its school system is by some measures the world&apos;s best. The island state promotes itself as diverse, competitive and cultured \u2013 an exciting global hub. But there are two league tables which shame Singapore. The first, compiled by the campaigning group Reporters Without Borders, places the country 136th in the world for press freedom \u2013 below Iraq and Zimbabwe. The second is the rate at which Singapore executes convicted criminals: arguably higher, per capita, than any other country in the world. Singapore presents itself as a modern liberal democracy: it has a parliament, elections, courts, a constitutional right to free speech and the consumerist gloss of capitalism. Its citizens are free to become rich and to travel. Many do both. The country has by any measure succeeded since independence. But its autocratic political culture \u2013 overseen by the country&apos;s founding father and now official minister mentor Lee Kuan Yew \u2013 is highly and needlessly restrictive. The media is largely state-owned. Defamation and contempt laws threaten dissent. The latest victim of these is Alan Shadrake, a British-born writer sentenced yesterday to six weeks in prison and a large fine after being found guilty of contempt of court. His book Once a Jolly Hangman questioned the independence of Singapore&apos;s legal system, and its use of the death penalty. It is depressing that a country as successful as Singapore should feel the need for such restrictions on free speech. Singapore argues that, without them, the balance between the country&apos;s Chinese, Malay and Indian populations would be upset. But the reality is that other successful parts of Asia \u2013 Hong Kong and Taiwan, for instance \u2013 have thrived by extending free speech and the rule of law. Singapore is making itself a less significant place by refusing to give its people the sorts of freedoms that are routine elsewhere. On a practical level, the decision to prosecute Mr Shadrake was also foolish. His book has had far greater attention because of it, and Singapore&apos;s reputation has been harmed. Mr Shadrake is quite right to attack a criminal justice system whose victims are often poor migrant workers. His book was legitimate and \u2013 despite the court&apos;s claim to the contrary \u2013 largely accurate. The suspicion is that the Singapore government resented the exposure of a squalid system of routine executions which sits uneasily with the image it likes to present to the world. Singapore wants to be judged as a first-world nation. It must find the confidence to allow its citizens the freedoms that go with that status. Repression is not the route to success.

From one side, inflation hawks prefer austerity over expansion. Those who favour expansion and growth have valid concerns that it may not work and, instead, have negative global effects. At the G20, the United States got criticised \u2013 rightly \u2013 by emerging countries for the negative impact of QE2 on their economies.  The results of the recent US elections make it very difficult for the US to pursue the first best policy to keep its economy recovering: further fiscal expansion, for a time. As Keynes taught us, and we have seen during numerous crises, private investment and consumption will not recover on their own (due both to over-leveraging and lack of confidence), without the stimulus of aggregate demand, which only governments can give in these particular circumstances. Once the recovery is on track, fiscal policy needs to contract, to avoid both overheating and excessive public debt.  The Fed has already brought the short-term interest rate to zero, so Bernanke, to his credit, has ventured into the emergency toolkit. The Fed chairman should be applauded for his willingness to think past convention. As one of the last policy-makers in developed countries with significant economic power, he is now almost the sole voice for expansionary economic policy. However, on its own, QE2 may, indeed, not be enough to restore the US economy to growth; and it will contribute to further overheating of asset prices in the emerging economies, which could not just complicate macroeconomic management for them now, but also increase the risk of future crises. To ensure QE2 helps the US economy to grow, mechanisms need to be found to channel the additional liquidity created by the Fed to the real economy. The key is to expand credit to small and medium-sized enterprises, starved of funds at present, and to finance large investments in infrastructure, including that required to generate clean energy. Policy-makers must exercise creativity to help achieve this. The Europeans have a massive institution, the European Investment Bank (EIB), which last year lent more than $100bn; the US needs to create similar mechanisms quickly, or use existing institutions to lend more to the private sector. The Europeans, in turn, should further expand EIB lending. Internationally, if the US dug into the emergency toolbox again, it could place prudent capital regulations on the outflow of speculative capital from the US via the carry trade; this might help avoid future crises in those countries, which would harm not only them, but also the US and the world economy. More broadly, it is time policy-makers stopped letting the financial sector tail wag the real economy dog. Before and at the G20 summit, many emerging market politicians and well-known economists voiced serious concern over the global effects of quantitative easing. Increased US liquidity may pull dollars out of the US and invest them in nations with higher interest rates for rapid speculative return. Known as the carry trade, such speculative flows push up the value of emerging market currencies and create asset bubbles. It is for this reason that the US was criticised at the G20. Brazil, with interest rates over 10%, has seen an appreciation of over 30% due in part to the carry trade, and was most vocal in Seoul.  One remedy to the problem already under way is the use of capital controls in emerging markets. Many nations such as Brazil, India, China, Argentina, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, Peru and Indonesia have put in place controls to limit excessive inflows. Such controls have been sanctioned by the IMF \u2013 a landmark shift. The problem is that \u2013 on their own \u2013 controls from recipient countries may be overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the inflows, with investors often finding ways to evade them. Given that the majority of the carry trade effect will come from the US, the United States could start regulating the outflow of capital due to the carry trade. Controls on short-term outflows would facilitate the liquidity created by the Fed to stay in the US and have a better chance of going toward productive investment. Such investment could help developing countries via trade, rather than causing speculative capital to flow to emerging markets and cause havoc to their financial systems and their economies. By stemming criticism from emerging markets, the US may find more allies for a global growth agenda. Developing countries have deployed expansionary policy in the wake of the crisis, and it is working. It is important that their efforts are strengthened, and not undermined, by hot money. Together, they could pose a legitimate alternative to the austerity-ridden Europeans and new members of the US Congress."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/18/nato-kept-peace-60-years", "publicationDate": "2010-11-18T21:00:03Z", "tags": ["Nato", "World news", "US military", "US news", "Military", "UK news", "Afghanistan", "Foreign policy", "US foreign policy"], "sentences": ["Nor would they stand as one if Nato somehow became embroiled in a future crisis in Belarus, the Maghreb, the Middle East or even Taiwan."], "title": "Martin Kettle: For 60 years, Nato kept the peace in Europe.

Amid all the motorcades, flashbulbs and ceremonials of tomorrow&apos;s Nato summit in Lisbon \u2013 the most important Nato gathering for a decade, or since the fall of the Berlin Wall, depending on who you listen to \u2013 this remains the unresolved question haunting the much-expanded Atlantic alliance. That is not to say that the 28 Nato member states and their many partners, contacts and clients who will gather in Lisbon have nothing more concrete to discuss than the alliance&apos;s latest &quot;strategic concept&quot; \u2013 a crisp, concise and concrete document, according to one drafter \u2013 that will be unveiled by Nato secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen. On the contrary, what brings Barack Obama and many other heads of government to Portugal is one extremely urgent practical question, Afghanistan, and a clutch of other tangled regional and strategic issues that are only slightly less pressing and intractable. Afghanistan will undoubtedly dominate the summit. But there will be no dramatic initiatives. The reality of Nato deployment there is that, America and Britain excepted, most of the member states are doing the absolute minimum to support the mission consistent with preserving the alliance. With the Dutch gone and the Canadians going, the Obama administration&apos;s goal in Lisbon is the modest one of keeping the alliance lined up behind the four-year US handover timeline. It&apos;s simply about holding it all together. There will be other big topics on the table. Two stand out \u2013 and are related. Russia is the first, though relations with the old enemy are easier now than during the war in Georgia and since the Obama administration &quot;reset&quot; the dial with Moscow. The one-time superpowers are working together on nuclear weapons reduction and Afghanistan. But Obama may not be able to deliver on nukes if the Republicans on Capitol Hill dig in, and the two sides will simply never see eye-to-eye about Ukraine or Georgia. Some mutual suspicion is ineradicable. This week Pravda compared Nato&apos;s attitude to Russia to that of Hitler. The other big subject is Iran, whose conduct plays to Nato&apos;s need to find a new threat \u2013 not without reason in this case \u2013 against which it can justify its existence. Iran&apos;s intention of producing missiles that would threaten Europe is now treated as a given by Nato strategists, and Iran has duly overtaken North Korea and Saddam-era Iraq as the justification of choice for the deployment of a US missile defence shield in Europe. But the shield is on course to become a reality now, and Russian co-operation with it has been a pivotal shift. Yet Nato&apos;s underlying existential uncertainty should not be brushed aside just because there are practical matters of this kind. The fact remains that Nato was formed to defend western Europe against the Soviet Union. When the Soviet empire crumbled, the alliance was left without a clear role. Soldiers often talk about the fog of war. Yet Nato has operated ever since 1991 in a fog of peace. It owes its continuing existence as much to inertia as to any grand overarching military project. Over these years, Nato has attempted to reinvent itself in many ways: first as the guarantor of the newly independent former Soviet satellites and republics; then as the enforcer \u2013 eventually \u2013 of new nation states in the Balkans; and finally, since 2001, as a go-anywhere military alliance, classically in Afghanistan. Yet Nato&apos;s deployment in each of these roles took place at least as much for political as for military reasons. The truth is that Nato is now more obviously something that to some extent it has always been \u2013 an international auxiliary military force of the United States. This in no way means Nato is some surrogate of Satan. Supporters as well as critics of Nato converge on the point. The great achievement of Nato is that it has helped to keep the peace in Europe \u2013 with occasional exceptions \u2013 for more than 60 years. The longer this peace lasts, and the more distant the memory of war becomes, the more it needs to be reiterated that this is an epochal achievement on the grand historic scale. With Remembrance Day still fresh in the mind, the point may need less assiduous underlining. That all this suited US interests is true; but it unquestionably suited yours and mine too. And yet, 65 years since the guns fell silent, what were once common interests have naturally diverged and developed in different ways. It is no longer true that the European nations and the US have common foreign and security interests, as they once did. The Nato 28 are not united on Afghanistan any more than they were on Iraq, or for that matter on Georgia. Nor would they stand as one if Nato somehow became embroiled in a future crisis in Belarus, the Maghreb, the Middle East or even Taiwan. America no longer looks at the world through a European prism. All this has been sharply accentuated by the financial crisis, which has seen European nations slash their defence spending, to Washington&apos;s and the military&apos;s alarm. The upshot is that Nato today is more than ever an alliance between, on the one hand, a superpower which spends a lot on defence and is increasingly focused on the emergence of new powers in Asia; and, on the other, a lot of small nations which all spend relatively little on defence. Those small nations could certainly co-ordinate their spending more smartly and with less duplication, as Britain and France have recently pledged to do. Rasmussen&apos;s proposed streamlining of Nato&apos;s command structure is also manifestly overdue. But it is hardly surprising that the one remaining big spender calls most of the shots. There are better alternatives. More honourable ones too. The European members of Nato could all spend more as well as more smartly, perhaps making the 2% of national income on defence target a common goal, like the 0.7% pledge on aid. That way, Europe could increase its role in Nato or focus its defence policy in new and more independently European ways. Rasmussen&apos;s new strategic concept document will set out all the reasons \u2013 cyber, terrorist, ballistic and nuclear \u2013 as to why the defence and security job has to be done, in our name and whether we like it or not. If we don&apos;t own it, pay for it and do it ourselves in our way, it will be done by the Americans in theirs. And in two years&apos; time, if recent reports are to be believed, that might even mean by Sarah Palin."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2010/nov/19/ask-jack-usb-3-superspeed", "publicationDate": "2010-11-19T12:09:46Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Computing"], "sentences": ["All we have to go on is a recent item from Taiwan&apos;s DigiTimes, which said Intel planned to support USB 3.0 in a forthcoming laptop platform codenamed Chief River, with chips being released to manufacturers around September 2011."], "title": "Is it worth waiting for USB 3.0? | Ask Jack", "article": "When do you think we&apos;ll see USB 3.0 ports installed on mid-range laptops in the UK? I&apos;m wondering if I should hold off buying one until these SuperSpeed ports are embedded into laptops.Alex RentonDon&apos;t wait, unless you are prepared to wait until early in 2012. It looks as though USB 3.0 will not become ubiquitous until Intel adds support to its standard chip sets, and we don&apos;t know when that will happen. All we have to go on is a recent item from Taiwan&apos;s DigiTimes, which said Intel planned to support USB 3.0 in a forthcoming laptop platform codenamed Chief River, with chips being released to manufacturers around September 2011. Intel&apos;s next laptop platform is codenamed Huron River, and PCs based on that are expected to appear at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. Chief River is the one after that, which means 2012. Of course, companies that are willing to buy USB 3.0 chips from alternative suppliers are already shipping PCs with USB 3.0 ports, and have been all year. Some desktop PC motherboards now offer at least two USB 3.0 ports, mainly using NEC SuperSpeed chips, though chips are starting to arrive from other manufacturers as well. Unfortunately, USB 3.0 has not appeared in many laptops, though examples include the HP Envy 15, Dell Precision M6500, Asus N61 and N82, Acer Aspire TimelineX 4820TG, and MSI&apos;s GX660R. Bear in mind that USB 3.0 uses four extra wires (twice as many as USB 2), so it requires new blue-marked sockets and new cables, though the new sockets are backwards compatible with USB 2 cables. USB 3.0 is also allowed to demand significantly more electrical power. It does require more engineering than using off-the-shelf Intel parts. At the moment, USB 3.0&apos;s main application is attaching external hard drives, and there are plenty of those from Western Digital, Seagate, Buffalo, Freecom, LaCie, Iomega and other suppliers. These typically advertise a connection speed of 5Gbps. Even if they don&apos;t actually deliver that, they should still run about ten times faster than the average USB 2 connection, and this has a dramatic effect on backup times. USB 3.0 can also enable faster links to external Blu-ray drives. If you want to have a faster connection from a laptop PC to an external hard drive, you have a couple of choices. First, you could fit a two-port adaptor into an ExpressCard slot. Examples include the Freecom 34144 USB 3.0 Express Adapter, StarTech&apos;s SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Card Adapter, Newlink&apos;s NLUSB3-PCMEX2P, the Buffalo IFC-EC2U3UC Interface, the Trust SuperSpeed TRU-HUB-16909 and the RaidSonic ICY BOX IB-AC605 USB adapter. There must be at least a dozen options at prices from about \u00a315 to \u00a325, which isn&apos;t unreasonable. The main drawback with ExpressCard adaptors is that the connectors stick out a long way from the edge of your laptop. Also, you will need an ExpressCard 2.0 slot for maximum throughput. Second, you could buy a laptop that includes an eSATA external hard drive port, which may be combined with a USB 2 port. An eSATA connection may well be faster than USB 3.0, as confirmed by tests by CrunchGear. However, eSATA was designed to connect to standard SATA hard drives. It doesn&apos;t connect to such a wide range of devices as USB. Manufacturers who sell laptop PCs with eSATA/USB combo ports include, I think, Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Sony and Toshiba. These combo ports may also be &quot;sleep and charge&quot; ports: you can charge a mobile phone or MP3 player from one while your laptop is asleep. There are some conspiracy theories around to the effect that Intel has been slow to support USB 3.0 because it wants to promote its forthcoming Light Peak optical connection system. I doubt it, because it would be stupid to imagine that Light Peak could possibly generate the widespread support that USB has accumulated over 14 years. But if Intel has a better excuse, it isn&apos;t saying.  The growing volume of USB 3.0 peripherals is likely to prompt some manufacturers to fit USB 3.0 ports to more laptops, particularly the ones aimed at business users. Keep an eye on Dell and HP. Also, AMD could deliver support for USB 3.0 well before Intel. But still, the SuperSpeed port looks unlikely to reach the mass market for mid-range (under \u00a3500) laptops until Intel delivers USB 3.0 support as standard."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/19/farmville-they-reap-what-you-sow", "publicationDate": "2010-11-19T18:30:00Z", "tags": ["Games", "Virtual worlds", "Social media", "Facebook", "Internet", "Technology", "Digital media", "US news"], "sentences": ["The internet now boasts several massively popular farm-themed video games: from Farmerama to Happy Farm, where 23 million people in China and Taiwan daily tend their digital crops."], "title": "FarmVille: they reap what you sow | Laurie Penny", "article": "There can be no more elegant example of the alienation of the modern workplace than the fact that hundreds of millions of employees across the globe spend their lunch hours pretending to be farmers on the internet. With all the breathtaking and transformative power of the web at their fingertips, armies of workers and young people still choose to spend their online hours growing virtual potatoes on badly animated digital fields. One of the biggest forums for this activity is FarmVille, the online role-playing game made popular through Facebook, whose players tend and trade digital crops and livestock. Almost 100 million people subscribe to the game, which has just announced profits of $500m (\u00a3300m) for 2010. I have an account myself, and have spent many happy hours playing on my virtual farm, although my attempts to grow virtual opium were swiftly curtailed by the virtual CIA.

Zynga&apos;s stock is predicted to soar, especially after the launch of CityVille, an urban version that runs along the same principles of clunky virtual enterprise. Because of the extraordinary speed with which FarmVille has become popular, it is tempting to regard it as a fad; but this is no isolated phenomenon. The internet now boasts several massively popular farm-themed video games: from Farmerama to Happy Farm, where 23 million people in China and Taiwan daily tend their digital crops. Altogether, since 2008, the number of regular players of farm-themed online games across the world has ballooned to almost 150 million \u2013 2.5% of the entire human race. Most video games have obvious escapist themes, allowing players to immerse themselves in fantastical scenarios such as leading dwarf armies or shooting aliens in epic space battles. FarmVille is not really about escaping to a farm \u2013 most of the office workers saving their digital coins to buy virtual tractors would panic were they ever to be presented with an actual pig. Perhaps what the sudden popularity of co-operative farming games shows is that, for many modern workers, the idea of owning a piece of land within a friendly community is now just as inconceivable as pulverising zombie invaders in Resident Evil 4. Farming games tap into a powerful collective wish-fulfilment fantasy: the fantasy of running your own life rather than being a peasant in the neo-feudal hierarchy of corporate serfdom. The precarity and anxiety of modern labour conditions have become more acute during the financial crises of the past two years, and this is precisely the timeframe in which the craze for these online games took off. The bitter irony, of course, is that FarmVille itself is a neo-feudal state, where rich virtual landowners exploit the free labour of virtual farmhands to make real profits. For all its evocation of rustic utopia, this and other farm simulations are ruthless markets whose exploitation of human emotion is anything but virtual. Real-world gift cards, now available in real-world supermarkets, can buy FarmVille players in-game advantages such as better &quot;equipment&quot; and more &quot;seeds&quot;, and, as with many games, some independent speculators have made huge profits by trading online assets and even running gaming sweatshops to boost their profits. The launch of CityVille may simply be the logical next step in the online industrial revolution. The stated mission of Zynga is to &quot;connect the world through games&quot; \u2013 but rather than connecting the world, online farming games unite it in a compliant virtual fantasy of self-determination that displaces real resistance. Alienated workers pay real money to play out a fantasy of having control over the products of their own labour, but the true tragedy is that, even in the jerky bucolic idyll of FarmVille, they are still working for someone else&apos;s profit."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/25/huang-hua-obituary", "publicationDate": "2010-11-25T18:50:00Z", "tags": ["China", "United Nations", "US news", "Richard Nixon", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Huang&apos;s reward for this work was to be appointed the first People&apos;s Republic of China representative to the UN when\u00a0the country took up its seat there, supplanting the Republic of China on Taiwan.", "That year, Huang drafted the accord by which the US formally recognised the People&apos;s Republic over Taiwan.", "As such, his ability to speak on behalf of the republic, and assert its interests when necessary (he roundly condemned the US for its continuing arms sales to Taiwan from 1979 onwards), did his country huge service."], "title": "Huang Hua obituary", "article": "For more than half a century, the diplomat and statesman Huang Hua, who has died aged 97, played a pivotal role in communist China&apos;s relations with the international community.

Transcripts released by the US several decades later showed Huang to be an effective, sharp operator, more than able to hold his own with the clever and devious Kissinger. By late 1971, a deal for the re-establishment of\u00a0relations had been struck, leading to\u00a0Nixon&apos;s groundbreaking visit to Beijing in 1972. Huang&apos;s reward for this work was to be appointed the first People&apos;s Republic of China representative to the UN when\u00a0the country took up its seat there, supplanting the Republic of China on Taiwan. In 1976 Huang returned to Beijing, where he was made foreign minister. He was able to survive the upheavals associated with the purge of\u00a0the Gang of Four leaders, being trusted enough by the newly emergent Deng Xiaoping not only to remain as foreign minister, but also to serve concurrently as a state councillor and vice-premier until the mid-1980s, when he retired from all of these positions. The son of a teacher, Huang was born Wang Rumei, just after the fall of the Qing dynasty, in the province of Hebei, which surrounds Beijing. He studied at\u00a0Yanjing University in Beijing, and joined the Communist party in 1936, just before the war with Japan, which was to devastate the country. It was then that he assumed the name Huang Hua. His first significant role came that year, when he accompanied the American journalist Edgar Snow to the communist bases around Yan&apos;an, in northern China, resulting in Snow&apos;s book Red Star Over China (1937), which was widely credited with introducing the communists and their leadership to the rest of the world. Huang maintained friendly relations with Snow until his death in 1972, serving as Snow&apos;s translator when he visited China in 1970 as a guest of Mao Zedong. Active in the Beijing Communist Youth League and a number of other party posts during his early career, Huang was assigned as an assistant to Zhu De, one of the greatest military leaders of communist forces, in the 1940s. After the end of the Sino-Japanese war, he served as secretary to General Ye Jianying during the civil war against the nationalists. Huang&apos;s excellent spoken English meant that, upon the communist victory in 1949, he was placed in the newly established ministry of foreign affairs. He took part in truce talks during the Korean war from 1950 to 1953. From 1958, Huang spent much of his time outside China. He had a liaison role in Warsaw and served as ambassador, first in Ghana, then Egypt and Canada. He was the sole senior representative of China abroad in the depths of the Cultural Revolution in 1967, an era in which China was at its most isolated. He\u00a0was finally summoned back, spending a year in the countryside in 1970 before returning to Beijing to become involved in the secret talks with the US. Huang was subsequently active in three key areas of China&apos;s new international diplomacy. First, he negotiated and then signed a friendship accord with Japan in 1978, re-establishing formal relations with a\u00a0country with which, in his own memory, China had experienced a\u00a0devastating war. Japan was to prove one of China&apos;s key partners for the economic reforms that took place over the following two decades. Next, Huang accompanied Deng on his visit to the US in 1979, appearing in many of the photographs with his trademark broad, toothy smile, while Deng took centre stage. That year, Huang drafted the accord by which the US formally recognised the People&apos;s Republic over Taiwan. Finally, from 1980, Huang was instrumental in the talks with the UK over the status of Hong Kong, parts of which were due to be returned to Chinese sovereignty after the expiry of their leases in 1997. While foreign minister, Huang was energetically engaged in the re-estabishment of the republic as an international player. He effectively retired in 1985 but remained head of\u00a0a\u00a0number of friendship associations. For many major diplomats outside China, from the 1950s onwards, Huang was their first point of contact with the new regime in Beijing and the man mandated with building dialogue and trust. As such, his ability to speak on behalf of the republic, and assert its interests when necessary (he roundly condemned the US for its continuing arms sales to Taiwan from 1979 onwards), did his country huge service. Huang married He Liliang in the 1930s. She survives him, along with his two sons, a daughter and several grandchildren. \u2022 Huang Hua (Wang Rumei), diplomat, born 25 January 1913; died 24 November 2010 "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/26/son-former-taiwanese-leader-shot-at-rally", "publicationDate": "2010-11-26T19:22:24Z", "tags": ["China", "Taiwan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The son of a former Taiwanese vice-president was shot in the face at a rally on the outskirts of Taipei tonightlast night while campaigning for tomorrow&apos;s local elections.", "Taiwanese media said a 29-year-old man was shot dead at the event.", "President Ma Ying-jeou, who attended the hospital where Lien was being treated, told reporters: &quot;Taiwan is a democracy.", "Acts of violence are rare in Taiwanese politics, although Chen Shui-bian of the Democrative Progressive party was wounded by a gunshot on the eve of a dead-heat presidential election in 2004."], "title": "Son of former Taiwanese vice-president shot in face at rally", "article": "The son of a former Taiwanese vice-president was shot in the face at a rally on the outskirts of Taipei tonightlast night while campaigning for tomorrow&apos;s local elections.

So after the minor uproar that greeted her comment that &quot;we&apos;ve got to stand with our North Korean allies&quot;, the Republican presidential contender hit back using her preferred method of communication: Facebook. In an entry posted on her Facebook page on Thanksgiving \u2013 when most people would still be digesting turkey \u2013 Palin strung together an amusing series of verbal slips made by Barack Obama, and followed up by writing:  If you can&apos;t remember hearing about them, that&apos;s because for the most part the media didn&apos;t consider them newsworthy. I have no complaint about that. Everybody makes the occasional verbal gaffe \u2013 even news anchors. Obviously, I would have been even more impressed if the media showed some consistency on this issue. Unfortunately, it seems they couldn&apos;t resist the temptation to turn a simple one word slip-of-the-tongue of mine into a major political headline.  She&apos;s right, of course \u2013 and has a sense of humour (the news anchor link above is to Shepard Smith saying &quot;blow job&quot; on Fox News). The problem for Palin is that pointing out the failings of others does nothing to solve her own embarrassment. A writer on Little Green Footballs harshly remarked that Palin apparently believes &quot;pointing out someone else&apos;s mistakes is an excuse for her own stupidity&quot;.Given that Palin is considering a run for the Republican presidential nomination, and is one of the leading contenders according to opinion polls, her every remark will be scrutinized, just as George Bush&apos;s were before the 2000 election. Palin should recall that Bush&apos;s inability to name the president of Pakistan or the prime minister of India wasn&apos;t fatal to his presidential ambitions. (Although Bush did correctly name the president of Taiwan, and couldn&apos;t name the president of Chechnya, although that&apos;s understandable.) Having made her point, Palin goes on to say:  If the media had bothered to actually listen to all of my remarks on Glenn Beck&apos;s radio show, they would have noticed that I refer to South Korea as our ally throughout, that I corrected myself seconds after my slip-of-the-tongue, and that I made it abundantly clear that pressure should be put on China to restrict energy exports to the North Korean regime.  Actually, if you listen to Palin&apos;s remarks on Glenn Beck&apos;s show \u2013 you can read the official transcript here \u2013 it&apos;s clear her claim that &quot;I refer to South Korea as our ally throughout&quot; is specious.

We look set to get some clues. FBI agents swarmed into the offices of three US funds this week, seizing scores of boxes of documents and confiscating traders&apos; BlackBerrys as part of a sudden crackdown on insider trading. In images carefully orchestrated to alarm the financial community, burly men were photographed carrying carton after carton of printouts from the premises of Diamondback Capital Management, Level Global Investors and Loch Capital. A day later, hedge fund titans SAC Capital and Citadel, which manage $30bn (\u00a319bn) in assets between them \u2013 were served with subpoenas demanding information about trades. The criminal investigation, jointly conducted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), New York prosecutors and the FBI, is the biggest assault on insider dealing for years and it has severely rattled Wall Street. Shares in Goldman Sachs sunk following reports its junior bankers are facing a probe for alleged leaks of upcoming deals. But the key target for the authorities are little-known intelligence firms far from Wall Street that provide so-called &quot;expert network&quot; information to fund managers. On Wednesday, the Feds arrested Don Chu, an executive at a firm called Primary Global Research, which describes itself as a provider of &quot;incremental information&quot; giving institutional investors a &quot;strategic advantage&quot; in investment decisions. Firms such as Chu&apos;s conduct deep due diligence on quoted companies: they talk to suppliers, clients and employees in an effort to find out what products are hot and which lines are going cold. They&apos;ve been known to count the cars in car parks to see just how busy companies appear to be \u2013 all fodder to help fund managers decide whether to invest. This poses a dilemma. In a perfect free-market model, all investors on the stock market are supposed to have access to the same information. Deciding whether to buy shares in Apple, Google, eBay or Microsoft, investors can look at official quarterly reports providing balance sheets, sales numbers and earnings breakdowns to see how iPods, Android phones or Xboxes have been faring. On top of that, there&apos;s nothing wrong with doing a little extra industry research. But when does legitimate fact-finding tip over into obtaining unlawful insider information about commercially sensitive trading ahead of public disclosure? Chu is charged with covertly obtaining upcoming earnings figures from employees at technology companies such as Broadcom and Sierra Wireless which, if proven, amount to classic insider information. But is it illegal to befriend corporate executives and chat, in a more general sense, about business trends? An Ohio-based chain of discount household stores, Big Lots, has decided to test this: it is suing an &quot;expert network&quot; research company for snooping around its workforce and obtaining trade secrets by offering unspecified inducements to its employees. Chu, portrayed by New York&apos;s tabloids as a Thanksgiving turkey for the Wall Street-bashing Feds, will be the first of many to be arrested. The FBI moved quickly on him because he was preparing to fly to Taiwan. New York&apos;s federal prosecutor, Preet Bharara, recently declared that insider trading was rampant and that\u00a0it was acting like a financial steroid: &quot;It is unfair, it is offensive, it is\u00a0unlawful and it puts a black mark on the entire enterprise.&quot; As ever, when under threat, the financial community is defaulting to angry hyperbole. A Wall Street Journal columnist compared the SEC to Stalin, accusing the authorities of trying to criminalise routine investment research. And a hitherto obscure analyst, John Kinnucan, has become a hero, lauded by CNBC&apos;s financial blowhards for blowing the cover of the entire investigation by firing an email off to his hedge fund clients warning them that the FBI had tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade him to wear a wiretap to incriminate the recipients of tips. The problem is that on both sides of the Atlantic, insider information is extremely poorly drawn in law. The broadest possible definition of &quot;insider&quot; information would make most financial journalism a crime for uncovering price-sensitive stories. Beyond that, there&apos;s a sliding scale of nudges, winks and tip-offs. And the web has further blurred the line between rumour, private and public information. But illegal or not, this probe is lifting the lid on how hedgies operate. It&apos;s not always instinct, bravado and market nous that yield huge bonuses \u2013 it&apos;s paying large wodges of money to lackeys who count cars in office car parks."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/147040", "publicationDate": "2010-11-28T18:14:10Z", "tags": ["Paraguay", "Iran", "US foreign policy", "World news", "The US embassy cables", "US national security", "US news", "Americas"], "sentences": ["- Information on other key bilateral international relationships, especially for China, Taiwan, and Russia.", "- Information on military cooperation, assistance received or provided, or interaction with others in the region, for example, the training provided by Argentina; status of international military cooperation or assistance programs, such as the kinds of military support that might be offered by China, Iran, Venezuela, Taiwan, or other countries."], "title": "US embassy cables: Washington worries that Paraguay harbours Iranian agents and Islamist terrorists", "article": "Monday, 24 March 2008, 18:30S E C R E T STATE 030340 SIPDIS NOFORN EO 12958 DECL: 02/27/2033 TAGS PINR, KPRP, ECON, PREL, PGOV, ETRD, PA SUBJECT: (S) REPORTING AND COLLECTION NEEDS: PARAGUAY REF: 07 STATE 161706Classified By: PAULA CAUSEY, DAS, INR.

(C) Taiwan&apos;s participation as an observer at the upcoming May World Health Assembly (WHA) meetings demonstrated what could be achieved based on &quot;one China, very broadly interpreted,&quot; Vice Foreign Minister (VFM) He Yafei said at an April 30 working lunch hosted by the Charge d&apos;Affaires. In his capacity as G-20 Sherpa, VFM He said he would ask for appropriate meetings in Washington to discuss the dates and agenda of the next G-20 summit. VFM He reviewed several issues he hoped to discuss during his upcoming visit to Washington: On North Korea, China encouraged the United States to re-engage the DPRK, but if the Six-Party Talks were suspended for an extended period, we should consider maintaining engagement in other ways. On Iran, Beijing appreciated the &quot;bold steps&quot; taken by Washington and had told Tehran that this represented a good opportunity for Iran to resume a positive role in the region. On Afghanistan/Pakistan, VFM He asked to see a list of items that would be transported via the proposed Northern Distribution Network, given that &quot;non-lethal&quot; is a broad and vague term. 2. (S) Summary Continued: VFM He raised concerns over China&apos;s &quot;core interests&quot; of Tibet and U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, which he said could &quot;derail&quot; bilateral cooperation. The Charge raised the Liu Xiaobo and Gao Zhisheng human rights cases, to which VFM He replied with standard language about Chinese law. The Charge asked for assistance in expediting the exit from China of two North Koreans from the U.S. Embassy compound; VFM He promised to assist. The Charge urged China to press North Korea to release the two detained American journalists; VFM H said China would. VFM He expressed concern over building &quot;momentum&quot; on UNSC reform and asked the United States not to be &quot;proactive&quot; on the matter. The Charge expressed concern that differences regarding a Conditions of Construction Agreement (COCA) II for our new Consulate General in Guangzhou had begun to affect other parts of our support for each other&apos;s practical needs including residential leases and asked for VFM He&apos;s assistance in stopping this trend. The Charge and VFM He agreed on the importance of high-level meetings to the bilateral relationship and reviewed a number of recent and upcoming visits. End Summary. TAIWAN OBSERVERSHIP AT WHA -------------------------- 3. (C) The agreement allowing Taiwan to participate as an observer at the World Health Assembly (WHA) meetings in Geneva in May was &quot;one step forward&quot; toward better cross-Strait relations and demonstrated what could be achieved through consultations based on &quot;one China, very broadly interpreted,&quot; Vice Foreign Minister (VFM) He Yafei said at an April 30 working lunch hosted by the Charge d&apos;Affaires. Cross-Strait relations were &quot;improving,&quot; and as they did, China hoped the United States would feel &quot;less burdened, frustrated and nervous,&quot; VFM He said. The Charge congratulated VFM He on the agreement, noting its timeliness in light of concerns over the H1N1 outbreak, while expressing hope that both sides would continue to take steps to increase mutual trust. IMPORTANCE OF BILATERAL VISITS ------------------------------- 4. (C) The Charge and VFM He agreed on the importance of high-level meetings to the bilateral relationship and reviewed a number of recent and upcoming visits. Both concurred that Chief of Naval Operations ADM Roughead&apos;s visit to China was a success. The Charge emphasized that, as President Obama told Foreign Minister Yang, the United States wanted to move relations between our two militaries forward. VFM He agreed that State Councilor Liu Yandong&apos;s visit, including her meeting with Secretary Clinton, had been productive. VFM He said Liu came away &quot;very impressed&quot; by her interaction with Secretary Clinton and wanted very much to &quot;follow up&quot; on the issues they discussed such as education, something very basic and important to the people of both countries. 5. (C) Although we recognize the importance of the proposed visit by Politburo Member and CCP Organization Department BEIJING 00001176 002 OF 005 Head Li Yuanchao, it would be easier to arrange a successful visit if Li could postpone his travel to a less busy time, the Charge said. VFM He replied that the visit of Li, a &quot;future leader of China,&quot; was &quot;very important,&quot; so China hoped the United States would provide a full schedule of meetings with senior leaders despite the fact that those leaders recently met with State Councilor Liu. The Charge urged VFM He to arrange a useful schedule for Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, including a trip to Tibet or Tibetan areas, noting that the Speaker was also particularly interested in climate change and environmental issues. China would treat Speaker Pelosi&apos;s visit as a type of &quot;state visit,&quot; VFM He replied. Nevertheless, given her &quot;tight schedule,&quot; the Speaker would likely &quot;not have time&quot; to visit Tibet, VFM He said. 6. (C) Reviewing the upcoming meetings between Presidents Obama and Hu this year, VFM He noted that, over the past 30 years, the U.S.-China relationship had been driven by high-level visits to a greater degree than other bilateral relationships. With these meetings between our two presidents in mind, both sides should be &quot;careful&quot; and act in ways that benefit the long-term interests of the bilateral relationship. Our two presidents would meet several times in the coming months, including at the G-8, G-20 and APEC summits, after which China anticipated President Obama would visit China. We should plan our work for the bilateral relationship in the year ahead with the President&apos;s visit to China in mind. G-20: DATES AND TOPICS ----------------------- 7. (C) VFM He stated that, he would ask to meet with NSC&apos;s Michael Froman in Washington and was considering requesting an appropriate meeting with the Treasury Department. The topics would include the dates of the next G-20 meeting, as well as the agenda. 8. (C) In the first two G-20 Financial Summits, U.S. and Chinese positions had been close, closer even than the United States and Europe, VFM He noted. Views on major issues such as the need for fiscal stimulus and reform of international financial institutions were similar. Leading up to the London Summit, VFM He felt that the U.S.-U.K.-China &quot;troika&quot; had been effective: Beijing could persuade the developing countries, Washington could influence Japan and South Korea, and London could bring along the Europeans. 9. (C) The first two G-20 summits, according to VFM He, had succeeded in boosting confidence and agreeing on measures to help international financial institutions cope with the crisis. Now, the G-20 had entered an implementation period. He outlined four objectives that he intended to discuss with Froman: A) Establish what stimulus and macroeconomic policy coordination the G-20 economies needed to implement to ensure economic recovery; B) Strengthen the message against protectionism so that leaders did not &quot;break their promises as soon as they returned home&quot;; C) Set a clear timetable for IMF reform, establishing whether the New Arrangement to Borrow (NAB) decisions had any relation to future quota; and D) Reforming the international monetary system, vis-a-vis the dollar and an alternative reserve currency such as Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). 10. (C) Expounding on this last topic, VFM He stated that a stable U.S. dollar was good for China, and Beijing had no interest in &quot;destabilizing the system.&quot; The system, however, was &quot;not perfect and needs reform.&quot; He said China had a huge stake in how the United States managed the dollar. Further, VFM He suggested that the RMB could become a component of the SDR. Mentioning that the RMB could compose two percent of the SDR value, VFM He noted that this was more of a symbolic than practical change. 11. (U) Note: VFM He&apos;s comments on the Strategic and Economic Dialogue will be reported septel. VFM HE&apos;S WASHINGTON VISIT: DPRK, IRAN, AF/PAK --------------------------------------------- BEIJING 00001176 003 OF 005 12. (C) VFM He reviewed several issues he hoped to discuss during his upcoming visit to Washington, including North Korea, Iran and Afghanistan/Pakistan. On North Korea, VFM He hoped to hold &quot;informal consultations&quot; in Washington on how generally to approach the North Koreans, not just through the Six-Party Talks. Washington and Beijing nevertheless needed to discuss how to maintain momentum in the Six-Party Talks so as to preserve our common interest in stability of the Korean Peninsula. North Korea wanted to engage directly with the United States and was therefore acting like a &quot;spoiled child&quot; in order to get the attention of the &quot;adult.&quot; China therefore encouraged the United States, &quot;after some time,&quot; to start to re-engage the DPRK. In this regard, it was good that the New York channel remained open, VFM He observed. Noting that Special Representative for North Korea Policy Stephen Bosworth would visit Beijing in May, VFM He said that, if the Six-Party Talks would be on hold for an extended period, then the Six Parties needed to find ways to continue to engage the DPRK and each other, either bilaterally or even perhaps trilaterally. The Charge noted that we should be careful not to reinforce Pyongyang&apos;s bad behavior. 13. (C) VFM He also hoped to discuss the Iranian nuclear issue in Washington. Beijing appreciated the &quot;bold steps&quot; taken by Washington. China had told Tehran that this represented a good opportunity for Iran to resume playing a positive role in the region. Though such an Iranian role made moderate Arab countries &quot;jittery,&quot; VFM He said, this should be a matter the United States could &quot;manage.&quot; What was essential was to get Iran involved positively in the region again. 14. (C) VFM He said he also hoped to discuss Afghanistan/Pakistan. The Charge stated that, even though XXXXXXXXXXXX was unable to announce new money for Afghanistan at the April 17 Pakistan Donors&apos; Conference, China still had an opportunity to contribute to the security and stability of both Afghanistan and Pakistan. One way to do so would be to agree to a re-supply route via China for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. On the re-supply route question, VFM He said China would like to see a list of items that would be transported on the proposed route, noting that &quot;non-lethal&quot; is a broad and vague term. TIBET AND TAIWAN AS &quot;CORE INTERESTS&quot; ------------------------------------ 15. (C) VFM He raised concerns over China&apos;s &quot;core interests&quot; of Tibet and Taiwan, which he said could &quot;derail&quot; bilateral cooperation. On Tibet, China had heard &quot;rumors&quot; that the Dalai Lama would attend a &quot;seminar&quot; in the United States in late September or early October, and that President Obama was &quot;likely&quot; to meet with him then. Noting that there was no need for both sides to reiterate our respective positions on Tibet, VFM He said the critical question was whether both sides would agree to &quot;take care&quot; of each other&apos;s &quot;core interests.&quot; When considering such sensitive issues in the context of the bilateral relationship, they could be viewed either as &quot;obstacles&quot; or as &quot;core interests.&quot; It did not matter whether one side &quot;liked or disliked&quot; such matters; rather, in a &quot;mature, close and important&quot; bilateral relationship such as ours, the question was whether the key interests for each side would be accommodated. The United States had its core interests, VFM He asserted, such as U.S. naval vessels that had operated near the Chinese coast. Both sides agreed to &quot;step down&quot; over that issue, despite the strongly held views of the Chinese public. Regarding the Dalai Lama, China hoped the United States would deny him a visa, and if not, then agree to hold no official meetings with him, including no meeting with President Obama. 16. (C) The Charge expressed concern with China&apos;s defining Tibet as a &quot;core issue&quot; with the apparent expectation that others would &quot;step back.&quot; Instead, our two sides should agree to continue to discuss the issue in an attempt to resolve our differences. The United States recognized that Tibet is a part of China. Nevertheless, the Dalai Lama is a respected religious leader and Nobel Laureate, and U.S. officials meet with him in that capacity. Future meetings by U.S. officials with the Dalai Lama could not be ruled out. Moreover, there were serious concerns among the U.S. public, the Administration and Congress over the situation in Tibetan areas of China. China should take steps to address Tibetans&apos; legitimate grievances and engage the Dalai Lama&apos;s representatives in productive dialogue. Denying a visa to the Dalai Lama was not being contemplated. BEIJING 00001176 004 OF 005 17. (C) Another issue that could &quot;derail&quot; relations was arms sales to Taiwan, VFM He said. China had long opposed U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, especially advanced weapons sales. China was concerned by reports of possible &quot;very important&quot; and &quot;potent&quot; arms sales to Taiwan, including 60 Blackhawk helicopters and F-16 C/D fighter aircraft. Such arms sales were a &quot;very serious issue&quot; for China, AFM He said. The Charge replied that there had been no change to our one China policy based on the three joint communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). In accordance with the TRA, the United States made available to Taiwan defense articles that allowed Taiwan to maintain a credible defense. The Charge urged China to take steps to reduce military deployments aimed at Taiwan. HUMAN RIGHTS: LIU XIAOBO, GAO ZHISHENG --------------------------------------- 18. (C) The Charge raised two human rights cases, inquiring as to the status, location and treatment of dissident writer and Charter 08 signatory Liu Xiaobo and rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng. VFM He replied that, as a sign of the &quot;maturity&quot; of our bilateral relationship, he had &quot;repeatedly&quot; listened to our concerns regarding these two cases. Both cases would be handled &quot;according to law&quot; and in accordance with China&apos;s legal/judicial system. Such cases were &quot;sensitive&quot; and should be handled &quot;carefully,&quot; VFM He said, pledging that he nevertheless would look into the cases &quot;to the extent possible.&quot; NORTH KOREAN &quot;GUESTS&quot; --------------------- 19. (S) The Charge emphasized the importance of expediting exit procedures from China for two North Koreans who had entered the Embassy compound and asked for VFM He&apos;s assistance in doing so. VFM He said he would look into the matter. U.S. JOURNALISTS DETAINED IN DPRK --------------------------------- 20. (C) The Charge urged China to press the DPRK to release the two American journalists detained in North Korea. VFM He replied that the United States could &quot;rest assured&quot; that China would do so. UNSC REFORM ----------- 21. (C) China was concerned by &quot;momentum&quot; that was building on UN Security Council reform, which was &quot;not good&quot; for the P-5, VFM He said. China wanted the United States to maintain its position on UNSC reform and not be &quot;proactive&quot; on the matter, which the PRC feared could result in a UN General Assembly resolution on the subject. The P-5 &quot;club&quot; should not be &quot;diluted,&quot; VFM He said. If we end up with a &quot;P-10,&quot; both China and the United States would &quot;be in trouble.&quot; Moreover, it would be difficult for the Chinese public to accept Japan as a permanent member of the UNSC. The Charge replied that the Administration had not completed its policy review on UNSC expansion, so we do not yet have a position on specific proposals. Nonetheless, the United States believed that UN members should be allowed to state their positions freely and openly without undue P-5 influence. Regarding Japan, the Charge said that, while no decision had been made about which countries to support for permanent membership on the UNSC, it was hard to envision any expansion of the Council that did not include Japan, which was the second-largest contributor to the UN budget. COCA II: AVOIDING A &quot;TRADE WAR&quot; -------------------------------- 22. (C) The Charge expressed concern that differences regarding a Conditions of Construction Agreement (COCA) II for our new Consulate General in Guangzhou had begun to leak into other areas. The Charge asked VFM He to speak with the appropriate PRC officials to stop this trend before significant damage was done. The COCA II team from Washington held good discussions in Beijing last week with MFA DG for Administrative Affairs Li Chao regarding the new CG Guangzhou complex. The U.S. Embassy today had formally invited DG Li to Washington in May for further talks. One serious problem, the Charge noted, was the Chinese having moved to block new housing leases for the U.S. Embassy in BEIJING 00001176 005 OF 005 Beijing in an apparent attempt to gain leverage on office properties. VFM He said this situation sounded like a &quot;trade war.&quot; The Charge asked VFM He to help stop this matter before it led to a downward cycle. VFM He said he believed real progress had been made and differences narrowed during the most recent round of COCA II talks and that China did not want a &quot;trade war&quot; over COCA II issues. He pledged to &quot;look into&quot; the matter.

(S) SUMMARY: Deputy Secretary Steinberg used his meeting with Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew to stress the importance of Chinese cooperation in addressing the North Korea nuclear issue and to elicit MM Lee&apos;s views on China and North Korea. MM Lee said the Chinese do not want North Korea to have nuclear weapons and do not want North Korea to collapse. If China has to choose, Beijing sees a North Korea with nuclear weapons as less bad than a North Korea that has collapsed. MM Lee asked Deputy Chief of the People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Ma Xiaotian what China can do about North Korea. General Ma&apos;s answer was that &quot;they can survive on their own.&quot; The Deputy Secretary noted that the DPRK could have a fair and attractive deal if it would change its approach. If not, North Korea faces a change of course by the United States, the ROK and Japan. MM Lee said he believes Japan may well &quot;go nuclear.&quot; MM Lee also offered views on the Chinese economy, Taiwan, Chinese leaders, and U.S.-China relations. End Summary. China and North Korea --------------------- 4. (S) Deputy Secretary Steinberg met with Singapore Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew on May 30 on the margins of the Shangri-La Dialogue, the annual international security forum held in Singapore. The Deputy Secretary used the meeting with MM Lee to stress the importance of Chinese cooperation in addressing the North Korea nuclear issue and to elicit MM Lee&apos;s views on China and North Korea. MM Lee said the Chinese do not want North Korea to have nuclear weapons. At the same time, the Chinese do not want North Korea, which China sees as a buffer state, to collapse. The ROK would take over in the North and China would face a U.S. presence at its border. If China has to choose, Beijing sees a North Korea with nuclear weapons as less bad for China than a North Korea that has collapsed, he stated. 5. (S) MM Lee said he asked Deputy Chief of the People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Ma Xiaotian what China can do about North Korea. General Ma&apos;s Delphic answer was that &quot;they can survive on their own.&quot; MM Lee said he interpreted this as meaning that even if China cut off aid, the DPRK leadership would survive. This is a leadership that has already taken actions like killing ROK Cabinet Members in Burma and shooting down a KAL flight. If they lose power, they will end up facing justice at The Hague, like Milosevic. They have been so isolated for so long that they have no friends, not even Russia. They have not trusted China since the Chinese began cultivating ties with the ROK, given China&apos;s interest in attracting foreign investment, he said. The Deputy Secretary noted that the DPRK could have a fair and attractive deal if it would change its approach. If not, North Korea faces a change of course by the United States, the ROK and Japan. MM Lee expressed worry about the effect on Iran if the DPRK persists. MM Lee said he believes the DPRK can be contained and will not proliferate, but Iran has very high ambitions, ties to Shiite communities outside Iran, and oil wealth. 6. (S) The Deputy Secretary noted that North Korea&apos;s decisions will have an impact in Japan. MM Lee said he believes Japan may well &quot;go nuclear.&quot; The Chinese must have factored this into their calculations and concluded that the prospect of Japan with nuclear weapons is less bad than losing North Korea as a buffer state. The Chinese take a long-term view and must think that within a few years the DPRK&apos;s current leadership will be gone and there will be new leadership, with new thinking. But there will still be a North Korea, he said. 7. (S) MM Lee said he wishes the USG well in its efforts on North Korea, but he would be surprised if the North Koreans agree to give up nuclear weapons. They might give up a first-strike capacity, but they want nuclear weapons in case the USG decides to seek regime change. They are psychopathic types, with a &quot;flabby old chap&quot; for a leader who prances around stadiums seeking adulation. MM Lee noted that he had learned from living through three and a half years of Japanese occupation in Singapore that people will obey authorities who can deny them food, clothing and medicine. 8. (S) MM Lee said the ROK, after seeing what had happened with German unification, does not want immediate unification with the DPRK. There is &quot;nothing there&quot; in the DPRK, other than a military organization. Kim Jong-Il has already had a stroke. It is just a matter of time before he has another stroke. The next leader may not have the gumption or the bile of his father or grandfather. He may not be prepared to see people die like flies. China is calculating all this. They have their best men on the job. They want to help the United States to advance common objectives. But they do not want the South to take over the North, MM Lee said. Chinese Economy --------------- 9. (C) Regarding the Chinese economy, MM Lee said the global economic crisis has hit many countries, but the feel on the ground differs considerably from place to place. The Chinese economy is reportedly in the doldrums, but when MM Lee visited Jiangsu Province on May 24, his impression was one of continued prosperity. Shanghai has been harder hit, with container port traffic down 30-35 percent, similar to the situation in Singapore. There is no sign of deep unrest in China. The Chinese are very confident they will be able to sustain eight percent growth. The government is pumping resources into the economy, with a focus on developing Western China. Whether such policies can be sustained for three to four years is unclear, but China can certainly sustain these policies for at least a year, he said. 10. (C) MM Lee stated that in the absence of a social safety net in China, the Chinese savings rate is 55 percent, exceeding even Singapore&apos;s 50 percent level. Consumption accounts for only 35 percent of Chinese GDP, as opposed to 70 percent of U.S. GDP. The Chinese leadership may be loath to shift permanently to a more consumption-oriented economy, but the leadership will do so temporarily, if only to avoid unrest. 20 million people have moved back to the countryside because of economic dislocations. The government is providing microfinance to facilitate the transition. The pragmatists are in charge. There is nothing Communist about it. They just want to preserve one party rule. The Deputy Secretary expressed concern that current Chinese policies designed to counter the economic crisis could undermine reform. MM Lee said this cannot be helped. China wants to prevent riots like the ones that happened in Guangzhou in March when Hong Kong-connected enterprises suddenly shut down, he said. Taiwan ------ 11. (C) The Deputy Secretary asked MM Lee for his assessment of Taiwan. MM Lee said former President Chen Shui-bian had left Taiwan in a weak economic position, which had enabled President Ma Ying-Jeou to come to power with his pledge to strengthen the economy through means including expanding the three links with China. In Beijing, former President Jiang Zemin was wedded to his eight-point approach, but President Hu Jintao was more flexible. Jiang wanted to show he was a great man by solving the Taiwan issue in his lifetime, but Hu is more patient and does not have any fixed timeline. In Chinese domestic politics, Hu had wanted Vice Premier Li Keqiang from the Communist Youth League to emerge as his successor, not Vice President Xi Jinping, but Hu did his calculations and accepted Xi when it became clear that Xi had the necessary backing from the rest of the leadership. Similarly, on Taiwan, Hu will be pragmatic. It does not matter to Hu if it takes 10 years or 20 or 30. The key is building links with Taiwan. As in the case of Hong Kong, if necessary the tap could be turned off, he said. 12. (C) In this context, MM Lee said, Hu could live with Ma&apos;s positions on the &apos;92 consensus and on not addressing the reunification issue during his term in office. What mattered to Hu was that Taiwan not seek independence. If that happened, China has 1,000 missiles and is building its capacity to hold the U.S. fleet at a distance. The implicit question for Taiwan&apos;s leaders is if that is what they want, MM Lee said. 13. (C) MM Lee stated that the alternative is Mainland investment in Taiwan stocks and property. The Mainland has already assured Hong Kong that it will help out economically. The Mainland has not said this to Taiwan, but the Mainland&apos;s Taiwan Affairs Director, Wang Yi, did urge Chinese companies to invest in Taiwan. In four years Taiwan&apos;s economy will pick up and Ma will win re-election. The DPP lacks strong potential candidates. Su Zhen-chang is promising, but seems unlikely to be able to win. Meanwhile, even the traditionally DPP-supporting farmers in Taiwan&apos;s South need China&apos;s market for vegetables and other products. Taiwan&apos;s continued participation in the World Health Assembly depends on Beijing. Beijing&apos;s calculation seems to be to prevent Taiwan independence in the near term, then bring Taiwan &quot;back to China,&quot; even if it takes 40 or 50 years. MM Lee said he is looking forward to visiting Fujian Province, where preparations are underway for a new southern economic area linked with Taiwan. Xi Jinping ---------- 14. (C) The Deputy Secretary asked if in the future a leader like Xi Jinping would continue the policies on Taiwan followed by Hu Jintao. MM Lee responded affirmatively. Xi is a princeling who succeeded despite being rusticated. When the party needed his talents, Xi was brought in as Shanghai Party Secretary. Xi is seen as a Jiang Zemin protege, but in another three and a half years Jiang&apos;s influence will be gone. The focus now is on maintaining the system. There are no more strongmen like Deng Xiaoping. Jiang did not like Hu, but could not stop him, because Hu had the backing of the system and he did not make mistakes. Wang Qishan ----------- 15. (C) MM Lee said Vice Premier Wang Qishan, whom the MM saw in connection with celebrations in May of the 15th anniversary of Singapore-China Suzhou Industrial Park, is an exceptional talent, very assured and efficient. Wang handled SARS superbly when he was in Hainan. He excelled in coordinating the Beijing Olympics. Li Keqiang may not get the Premiership and the Party is looking for a way to keep Wang on past his 65th birthday until he is 70. MM Lee said he had met first Wang back in the 1990s but had forgotten their meeting. This time when they met, Wang told Lee he had reviewed the records of all Lee&apos;s meeting with Chinese leaders going back to the days of Deng Xiaoping to see how Lee&apos;s thinking had developed. Wang told Lee he respects him as a consistent man. China&apos;s Rise ------------ 16. (C) MM Lee said China is following an approach consistent with ideas in the Chinese television series &quot;The Rise of Great Powers.&quot; The mistake of Germany and Japan had been their effort to challenge the existing order. The Chinese are not stupid; they have avoided this mistake. China&apos;s economy has surpassed other countries, with the exceptions of Japan and the United States. Even with those two countries, the gap is closing, with China growing at seven-nine percent annually, versus two-three percent in the United States and Japan. Overall GDP, not GDP per capita, is what matters in terms of power. China has four times the population of the United States. China is active in Latin America, Africa, and in the Gulf. Within hours, everything that is discussed in ASEAN meetings is known in Beijing, given China&apos;s close ties with Laos, Cambodia, and Burma, he stated. 17. (C) MM Lee said China will not reach the American level in terms of military capabilities any time soon, but is rapidly developing asymmetrical means to deter U.S. military power. China understands that its growth depends on imports, including energy, raw materials, and food. This is why China is working with South Africa on the China-Africa Development Fund. China also needs open sea lanes. Beijing is worried about its dependence on the Strait of Malacca and is moving to ease the dependence by means like a pipeline through Burma. Build Ties with Young Chinese ----------------------------- 18. (C) MM Lee said the best course for the United States on China is to build ties with China&apos;s young people. China&apos;s best and brightest want to study in the United States, with the UK as the next option, then Japan. While they are there, it is important that they be treated as equals, with the cultural support they may need as foreigners. Why not have International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs for China? Why not have Chinese cadets at West Point alongside Vietnamese cadets and Indian cadets? America&apos;s advantage is that it can make use of the talent of the entire world, as in Silicon Valley. China still tends to try to keep the foreigners in Beijing and Shanghai. MM Lee noted that his own experience as a student in the UK had left him with an enduring fondness for the UK. When he spent two months at Harvard in 1968, an American professor had invited him home for Thanksgiving. This was not the sort of thing that happened in the UK, and Lee had realized he was dealing with a different civilization. In the future, China&apos;s leaders will have PhDs and MBAs from American universities, he predicted. 19. (U) The Deputy Secretary has cleared this message.

It includes verdicts on the first batch of revelations from a very eclectic cast of characters including: Sarah Palin; Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Hillary Clinton, and a Today programme ding-dong between Sir Christopher Meyer and Alan Rusbridger.  7.34am: The rest of the British media wasn&apos;t that interested in WikiLeaks disclosures yesterday. But that&apos;s all changed today now that royalty is involved.       The Daily Mirror&apos;s front page describes Prince Andrew as the Duke of Yuk (left), the Sun calls him the Tirade Envoy.  The Daily Mail goes with Exposed: Andrew&apos;s 4-letter Tirade; and the Telegraph leads with &quot;Duke raged at &apos;idiocy&apos; of fraud inquiry&quot;  (though its web version of the story has slightly different headline). Inside the Telegraph devotes four news pages to following-up the WikiLeaks and Guardian disclosures, but its comment pages are sniffy about the exercise. &quot;The mass release of American diplomatic cables by the WikiLeaks website has, so far, generated a great deal of heat but not a lot of light,&quot; its editorial says. It also carries a scathing opinion piece from the former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, now chairman of the intelligence and security committee.   It is too early to say precisely what damage the WikiLeaks revelations will do. Many of us suspected that Arab leaders were even more alarmed than the West at the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran. It does not surprise me that they would be supportive of a military attack if all other pressures fail. The fact that this is now public may bring home to the international community and, in particular, Russia and China, that the UN Security Council must agree very heavy sanctions and pressure on Iran if the whole Middle East is not going to be disrupted by conflict. But regardless of whether the spotlight of unauthorised publicity might, occasionally, help rather than hinder, the deliberate leaking of sensitive dispatches and diplomatic cables is highly damaging in what is already a very dangerous world.   8.07am: Most of the last night&apos;s BBC Newsnight programme was devoted to WikiLeaks.  It included some interesting comments on the Duke of York from Labour MP John Mann. He suggested that the Prince might have to resign as trade ambassador.  If these comments by Prince Andrew are accurate - and of course we don&apos;t know that yet - then clearly it&apos;s of public interest that they are out there, so that he can judge whether he is performing the role well and government can make that judgment as well. Prince Andrew will need to think through if he is actually carrying out this role to the best of his abilities.   8.43am: Former foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind said China will be &quot;very very angry&quot; with the disclosures on China&apos;s possible new stance on North Korea. &quot;And rightly so,&quot; he told Today programme.      Malcolm Rifkind MP Photograph: Guardian    &quot;The tragedy of these WikiLeaks is that if China is contemplating a historic change in its attitude to North Korea and possibly support for reunification, this premature revelation ... will have put that back by years. That shows the damage that can be done by unauthorised leaks from private conversations.&quot;  He said the documents on Korea, and the cables yesterday about Saudi Arabia&apos;s desire to attack Iran, should only have been available to handful of senior officials. &quot;Clearly they [the Americans] lost control of the system,&quot; he said.  On Prince Andrew&apos;s comments Rifkind said they were &quot;very unwise remarks to make&quot;. But he said he should carry on as trade envoy. &quot;He is an extremely good trade representative. He has always been known to be a blunt speaker,&quot; he said.      Tania Branigan Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    8.44am: Over to Tania Branigan in Beijing where Chinese officials have been making their first comments on the leaked cables.   Beijing called on the US to &quot;properly handle&quot; the emergence of the diplomatic cables, but sought to play down the issue in its first response to the release. Foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a regular press briefing: &quot;We do not want to see any disturbance in China-US relations.&quot; But he declined to comment on any of the issues raised in the documents. Asked whether Beijing believed that North Korea had behaved &quot;like a spoilt child&quot; \u2013 as a senior official remarked, according to one of the cables - Hong replied: &quot;China takes note of the leaked reports. We hope the US side will properly handle the relevant issues. As for the content of the documents, we do not comment on that.&quot;    9.13am: The chairman of North Korea&apos;s Supreme People&apos;s Assembly, Choe Thae Bok, arrived in Beijing today for a five-day visit, according to AP. He was summoned by China to discuss the current tension in the peninsula after the North unleashed a fiery artillery barrage on a South Korean island. They have lots to talk about, but don&apos;t expect any leaked cables from that visit.  9.31am: The New York Times trawl for latest leaks reveals the extraordinary horse trading between the US and its allies over the fate of Guant\u00e1namo Bay prisoners. Slovenia was promised more &quot;high-level attention&quot; if it helped with detainees; the Maldives said it would accept prisoners in return US help in getting IMF loans; and the Pacific nation Kiribati was offered $3m to take 17 Chinese detainees.  There&apos;s lots more including details a suggestion by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to implant electronic chips in the detainees.  9.55am: There&apos;s no mention of Ecuador in the haggling over Guant\u00e1namo Bay prisoners. But according to Al Jazeera, Ecuador has offered residence to someone to another US problem - Julian Assange. &quot;We are ready to give him residence in Ecuador, with no problems and no conditions,&quot; Kintto Lucas, the deputy foreign minister, said.  &quot;We are going to invite him to come to Ecuador so he can freely present the information he possesses and all the documentation, not just over the internet but in a variety of public forums.&quot; There&apos;s more in Spanish on the Ecuador news site Ecuadorinmediato.com  10.15am: Pentagon papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg has defended the release of the cables.  Asked on CNN&apos;s Larry King show about Hillary Clinton&apos;s condemnation of the WikiLeaks, Ellsberg said &quot;There hasn&apos;t been a secretary of state who wouldn&apos;t have said exactly the same thing about the Pentagon papers.  &quot;I&apos;m sure in America they see Julian Assange as the most dangerous man. A truth teller is potentially very embarrassing.&quot; Saving diplomats embarrassment was not enough of an excuse to withhold the information, he said.  10.34am: Gordon Brown a made personal request to allow the hacker Gary McKinnon to serve a sentence in the UK, but the request was rejected by the US, the latest disclosure shows.     'Super hacker' Gary McKinnon    Here&apos;s the relevant document.  Louis Susman, the current US ambassador to London wrote: &quot;PM Brown, in a one-on-one meeting with the ambassador, proposed a deal: that McKinnon plead guilty, make a statement of contrition, but serve any sentence of incarceration in the UK. Brown cited deep public concern that McKinnon, with his medical condition, would commit suicide or suffer injury if imprisoned in a US facility.&quot; The ambassador says he sought to raise Brown&apos;s request in Washington with Obama&apos;s newly appointed attorney general, Eric Holder. But the plea got nowhere.   11.19am: NATO has joined the international condemnation of WikiLeaks after leaked cables revealed the European countries hosting US nuclear weapons. NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu described the disclosures as &quot;illegal and dangerous.&quot; One of cables revealed that US nuclear weapons still left in Europe are based in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Turkey. The four nations have been long suspected of hosting the warheads, but NATO and the governments involved have always refused to confirm this. If you haven&apos;t seen it this seems a good moment to look at Steve Bell&apos;s cartoon today. There&apos;s more on Bell brilliance on his noisy website.     Copyright \u00a9 Steve Bell 2010     11.34am: Downing Street just told lobby journalists that the government&apos;s position on the extradition of Gary McKinnon has not changed. We don&apos;t quite know what its position is - the Cameron government has failed to announce whether or not it will comply with continued US demands to hand over McKinnon after he hacked into their government computers.  12.01pm: Time for a summary:      \u2022 The latest released cables show that US spurned British attempts to allow the computer hacker Gary McKinnon to serve sentence in UK. McKinnon&apos;s mother is appearing before the home affairs select committee.\u2022 Malcolm Rifkind, former foreign secretary and chairman of the intelligence and security committee, said the leaks could scupper China&apos;s apparent support for a reunified Korea. Speaking on the Today programme he also described Prince Andrew&apos;s rude comments about journalists, the French and fraud investigators as &quot;very unwise remarks to make&quot;.\u2022 In an interview with Forbes magazine Wikileaks founder Julian Assange revealed that his next target for documents disclosures will be a large US bank. &quot;A major American bank will suddenly find itself turned inside out,&quot; it said.\u2022 In its first comments on the leaks, China called on the US to &quot;properly handle&quot; the emergence of the cables. Foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a regular press briefing: &quot;We do not want to see any disturbance in China-US relations.&quot; (8.44am)  12.11pm: Janis Sharp, Gary McKinnon&apos;s mother, said she was &quot;very surprised and very pleased&quot; to hear that Gordon Brown had tried to bargain with the Americans in an attempt to avoid his extradition.  &quot;I wish I had known about that, because he [Brown] would have been given credit for it,&quot; she told the home affairs select committee.  She also criticised the Americans for refusing to budge. &quot;They know this is a difficult decision for this government and yet they did not want to give leeway,&quot; she said. &quot;The fact that people at the top are so intransigent, I find difficult to understand... I believe America wants Gary as an example of computer crime.&quot;       12.20pm: Our Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis reports on the reaction in France, where Le Monde has been poring over the cables.  Le Monde is preparing to release documents relating to France in the coming days. The paper said these will give US view of Paris&apos;s anti-terrorism policy, Washington&apos;s interpretation of the suburb riots of 2005 and France-US relations. Today the paper&apos;s website has explored French negotiations over taking former Guant\u00e1namo Bay bay detainees. It says Sarkozy&apos;s government was keen to make a gesture to help the Obama administration in order to improve Paris-Washington relations. But the French media, left and right, today slammed the publication by the Guardian and others of the US embassy cables. The right-wing Le Figaro, close to the French government, ran an editorial entitled &quot;The tyranny of transparency&quot; saying: &quot;The massive diffusion of secret documents belonging to American diplomacy is an act of malice, about which it would be very na\u00efve to rejoice.&quot; The left-wing Lib\u00e9ration warned that &quot;in a world of violent conflict&quot;, states had a &quot;right&quot; to their secrets, adding that the private positions so-far revealed were little different from what the governments were saying in public. The Socialist party was as critical of the leaks as Sarkozy&apos;s right-wing UMP party. The socialist Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis complained of &quot;the tyranny of transparency with no limits&quot; . Socialist spokesman Beno\u00eet Hamon said he was &quot;not really in favour&quot; of the publication of the cables.  Josselin de Rohan, the UMP head of the foreign affairs commission in the French senate, said the publication was &quot;very serious&quot; and raised questions of blackmail and voluntary disinformation: &quot;I think we&apos;ve gone over the boundary here of what&apos;s possible in the domain of information.&quot;  Francois Baroin, budget minister and government spokesman, told Europe1 radio, &quot;I always thought a transparent society would be a totalitarian society.&quot; He said Sarkozy thought the leaks were &quot;irresponsible to the last degree&quot;.    12.32pm: Saeed Kamali Dehghan has more on the Iranian reaction to the cables.        In Iran the release of the cables has been overshadowed by the assassination of two nuclear scientists. But today opposition websites started covering the leaks more widely.  The disclosure in a 2009 diplomatic cable that the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has terminal cancer has attracted attention. Nikahang Kowsar, a prominent Iranian cartoonist, based in Canada, suggested that Hashemi Rafsanjani, an influential Iranian cleric thought to be sympathetic to the opposition, could be his successor. Rafsanjani is dipicted sitting on a egg timer next to an ailing Khamenei. Another cartoon by Kowsar picks up the view of the Saudi Arabia&apos;s King Abdullah that Ahmadinejad is the head of a snake that needs cutting off.  The foreign-based Iranian opposition websites have also focused on the revelations that Iranian parliament speaker, Ali Larijani, was aware of rape and sexual assaults in Kahrizak detention centre in the aftermath of Iran&apos;s disputed election in 2009.  Yesterday, Ahmadinejad dismissed the leaks as part of US psychological warfare. It was a theme taken up today by Iran&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast. IRNA, Iran&apos;s state news agency, quoted him saying &quot;As the president stated yesterday, this action is very dubious and it should not be taken seriously.&quot;  He added: &quot;They [Wikileaks cables] were revealed in order to create quarrels between countries, they want to create an Iranophobia between nations.&quot;  12.56pm: WikiLeaks says its website is being subjected to another distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack. A similar claim on Sunday set a number of hares running, but it turned out to be the work of one hacker called Jester or the3j35t3r, according to the Tech site Mashable.  1.09pm: Business secretary Vince Cable has chirped on the Prince Andrew front. He said anti-corruption policy is &quot;not a matter&quot; for the Duke of York and he should stop talking about it. Speaking to Sky News Cable said it would be &quot;helpful&quot; if he the prince steered clear of policy issues. &quot;But his contribution is a very positive one and I want to encourage him to continue to make it,&quot; he diplomatically added.  1.27pm: The German magazine Der Spiegel provided a teaser of what some of the documents will say about Kenya. &quot;Viewed through the eyes of the US diplomats, entire states -Kenya for example - appear as mires of corruption,&quot; it said. It added: &quot;Almost every single sentence in the embassy reports speaks with disdain of the government of President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga.&quot; Alfred Mutua, Kenyan government spokesman, delivered an angry response. &quot;If what is reported is true, it is totally malicious, and a total misrepresentation of our country,&quot; he told a press conference, recorded by Capital FM Kenya.  &quot;True friends should tell you the truth all the time and should not tell you that everything is OK on one hand, and on the other say the opposite.&quot; The spokesman also revealed that the US government had apologised.              1.51pm: There&apos;s been more response to Gordon Brown&apos;s failed bargaining with the Americans over Gary McKinnon. Shami Chakrabarti, of Liberty, said:   While it is to Brown&apos;s credit that he pleaded with the US on behalf of Gary McKinnon, [Tony] Blair&apos;s shame is that the rights of people in Britain were signed away and left to special secret pleadings instead of law. No one should be sent anywhere without evidence in a local court and where justice and mercy suggest dealing with them at home.  Former home secretary David Blunkett told the home affairs select committee that he knew about Brown&apos;s appeal to the US at the time.  I remember discussing it with (current Justice Secretary) Ken Clarke in a private meeting that it would be a really good idea for this case not to end up being a political football. Although the [extradition] treaty itself is not responsible for the immediate removal of Gary... there was an issue for senior politicians to make representations.   2.08pm: Two US foreign affairs commentators Eli Lake, from the Washington Times and Daniel Drezner, from Foreign Policy, launch into a lively discussion about the disclosures on Bloggingheads TV. Lake says the cables reveal that Arab leaders are much more bullish about Iran than Israel. They go on to discuss whether suspected leaker Bradley Manning is a traitor or whistle blower. Drezner says that journalists are better at handling this kind of information than Julian Assange.       2.16pm: The US embassy cables story gets the bizarre news animation treatment from Taiwan&apos;s NMA. Taste alert: it includes Uncle Sam taking biometrical details from a UN official in a toilet bowl. And Messrs Sarkozy, Putin, and Gaddafi are not spared.              3.03pm: This is handy - a country guide to the main WikiLeaks revelations, from Reuters. It is likely to get fuller over the next few days.  3.21pm: The American Shanghai-based writer Adam Minter seizes on a tantalising looking cable suggestion corruption in China. It claims that a payment of $10,000 was offered to secure the support of premier Wen Jiabao for a mining contract for a North Korean copper mine.  But Minter says the cable reveals more about US diplomatic ignorance than corrupt practices in China.   Now, you don&apos;t need to know anything about graft in China, much less world leaders, or Wen Jiabao, to know that $10,000 not only wouldn&apos;t get the job done, it&apos;d be viewed as an insult and an automatic disqualification from this any other mining contract. So I&apos;m going to go out on a limb here: there&apos;s simply no way that happened. None. Zero. Zilch. Now, is it possible that Wen has a &quot;relationship&quot; with Wanxiang? Sure. But not the one described in the cable. And this gets to something that I think is going to become increasingly, uncomfortably obvious as more and more of these cables are released: US State Department employees in overseas posts often don&apos;t know very much about the countries in which they&apos;re posted  .  3.25pm: Blimey: Chinese officials have confirmed to Simon Tisdall that China does want to see an &quot;independent and peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula&quot;. So much for Malcolm Rifkind&apos;s fear that the Chinese would row back on that one.      That&apos;s it from me. The charming Richard Adams is about to breeze in from Washington.       3.40pm: Thank you Matthew and good morning from a damp Washington, where the US&apos;s bloggers and other media are still transitioning from their knee-jerk &quot;this is old news&quot; response to deciding that there is in fact some hot stuff amongst the cables. The Washington Post&apos;s neo-conservative leader writers today dismiss the cables as &quot;embarrassing to their authors or subjects, but otherwise harmless&quot;, and save their attention for how the leak happened in the first place:  Of course there must not be firewalls that prevent senior intelligence analysts and their bosses from seeing and sharing sensitive information. That does not mean a troubled 22-year-old in Baghdad should have access to secret State Department cables from all over the world. Surely there is a way to create a system that can do the former while preventing the latter.   3.58pm: Former senator Rick Santorum \u2013 best known for his ferocious opposition to homosexuality \u2013 is one of the dozens of Republicans who fancy being president \u2013 and he used a trip to New Hampshire, the birthplace of presidential ambition, to denounce WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange:  &quot;We haven&apos;t gone after this guy, we haven&apos;t tried to prosecute him, we haven&apos;t gotten our allies to go out and lock this guy up and bring him up on terrorism charges. What he&apos;s doing is terrorism, in my opinion.&quot;   4.05pm: From one pole of US politics (Santorum) to another: Noam Chomsky, speaking to Democracy Now!, says that while the cables reveal Arab leaders urging the United States to attack Iran, opinion polls in the region tell a different story:  What this reveals is the profound hatred for democracy on the part of our political leadership.  The Democracy Now! site reminds us that back in 1971, Chomsky helped whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg release the Pentagon Papers \u2013 and Ellsberg popped up on television last night to defend WikiLeaks, as mentioned below at 10.15am.  4.26pm: While there&apos;s a lot of talk about the damage these cables might do, NBC&apos;s Michael Isikoff has highlighted a case where the leaked information will be used as &quot;a recruiting and propaganda tool&quot; by al-Qaida. This is the revelation that the Yemeni government covered up the American role in missile strikes that killed 41 civilians, including 14 women and 21 children. Isikoff reports:  &quot;President Saleh&apos;s comments will be translated and used over and over again by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) as a recruiting and propaganda tool,&quot; Gregory Johnsen, a leading U.S. expert on the terror organization&apos;s Yemeni affiliate, told NBC on Monday. &quot;His statements and those of his top ministers of deceiving and lying to the Yemeni public and parliament \u2026 fit seamlessly into a narrative that AQAP has been peddling in Yemen for years. This is something AQAP will take immediate and lasting advantage of.&quot;   Isikof also points out that Amnesty International issued a report on the bombing earlier this year, with evidence of US involvement that has now been proved beyond doubt, thanks to the leak of the cables.             4.42pm: Meanwhile, former president Jimmy Carter popped up on MSNBC last night to dispute Hillary Clinton&apos;s claim that the US embassy cables had hurt international diplomacy:  &quot;I don&apos;t agree with Secretary Clinton that it&apos;s that significant it has torn up the fabric for our diplomacy,&quot; Carter said. &quot;In the future, there&apos;s going to be a lot more caution as leaders send them dispatches into the State Department and as our own ambassadors send reports back into the State Department if they suspect that their words might be revealed.&quot;   5pm: The US right is egging each other on into making ever more audacious demands about what the US government should do to both WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. Here&apos;s the latest from neo-con and Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol:  Why can&apos;t we act forcefully against WikiLeaks? Why can&apos;t we use our various assets to harass, snatch or neutralize Julian Assange and his collaborators, wherever they are? Why can&apos;t we disrupt and destroy WikiLeaks in both cyberspace and physical space, to the extent possible? Why can&apos;t we warn others of repercussions from assisting this criminal enterprise hostile to the United States?   5.24pm: Zbigniew Brzezinski, who served as national security advisor under Jimmy Carter, is more concerned about the US embassy cables than his old boss. Speaking to PBS News, Brzezinski also sees more sinister forces at work than just a leak coming from one member of the armed forces, and suggests a larger conspiracy theory:  It&apos;s, rather, a question of whether WikiLeaks are being manipulated by interested parties that want to either complicate our relationship with other governments or want to undermine some governments, because some of these items that are being emphasized and have surfaced are very pointed. And I wonder whether, in fact, there aren&apos;t some operations internationally, intelligence services, that are feeding stuff to WikiLeaks, because it is a unique opportunity to embarrass us, to embarrass our position, but also to undermine our relations with particular governments.   5.40pm: Yesterday the Washington Post&apos;s editor Marcus Brauchli was heard complaining that his newspaper wasn&apos;t offered a first look at the US embassy cables by WikiLeaks \u2013 and today the paper devotes more than four pages of broadsheet to the topic, and this media analysis of who got what and when.       5.49pm: My colleague Ewen MacAskill has unearthed this nugget from the files of cables \u2013 praise from a US ambassador for Moazzam Begg, the former British Guant\u00e1namo detainee, in an ironic turn of events:  Cynthia Stroum, ambassador to Luxembourg, acknowledges the irony of lavishing praise on Begg, who was alleged by the US to have been an instructor at an al-Qaida training camp in Afghanistan. In a cable labelled &quot;To Hell and Back: Gitmo ex-detainee stumps in Luxembourg&quot;, Stroum wrote that Begg was &quot;barnstorming&quot; through Europe. In January this year, he met the Luxembourg government and spoke at a public meeting. &quot;Mr Begg is doing our work for us and his articulate, reasoned presentation makes for a convincing argument. It is ironic that after four years of imprisonment and alleged torture Moazzam Begg is delivering the same demarche to GOL [the government of Luxembourg] as we are: please consider accepting GTMO detainees for resettlement.&quot;  If ever there was a sign of how ludicrous the US policy towards Guant\u00e1namo has been, this is it.

Photograph: Vincent Thian/AP    6.04pm: Now this is interesting: it&apos;s reported by Computerworld that China has blocked internet access to WikiLeaks&apos; US embassy cables:  Access to the WikiLeak&apos;s Cablegate page, as well as certain Chinese language news articles covering the topic, have been blocked in the country since Monday. Other articles from the Chinese press that are accessible on the web appear to only concern the US response.  The main issue is likely to be the revelation that the Chinese government was involved with the hack on Goggle&apos;s servers.      Martin Chulov    6.20pm: The Guardian&apos;s Martin Chulov is in Baghdad and reports from there on the delayed reaction to the US leaks: After a day&apos;s silence, Iraq has just responded to the US embassy cables. The leaks gave the Government a lot to reflect on \u2013 especially about the establishment&apos;s links to Iran and about how much influence the US has in vetting Iranian visitors. Prime Minister Nour al-Maliki felt the blowtorch of the Saudis and Americans in the cables, especially about his links to Tehran. But it was left to Foreign Minister, Hoshyer Zebari, a Washington chum, to defend the Government&apos;s honour. Zebari denied that Iraq hands the name of would-be Iranian visitors to the Americans before granting visas, saying their own spooks do the vetting themselves. He also downplayed the influence of the Kaiser S\u00f6ze of the Middle East, Qassem Suleimani, who heads the Iranian Revolutionary Guards&apos; al-Quds force, claiming he is just a regular guy. (Iraqi MPs have been known to tremble at the mention of the man). That should keep the neighbours happy.  6.34pm: Fast Company gives us a &quot;word cloud&quot; of one tranche of the cables:     US embassy cables word cloud from Fast Company    Kit Eaton of Fast Company writes:  Guess what word is most on the minds of US diplomats in 2010? Yup \u2013 Iran. &quot;Iranian&quot; is prominent in the mix too as is &quot;nuclear,&quot; which should explain the interest. Fascinatingly &quot;Turkey&quot; is more prominent than &quot;Afghanistan,&quot; possibly due to the country&apos;s key location in supporting US and Nato operations in both theaters of conflict.   6.53pm: Historian James Mann writes in the New Republic that the US embassy cable leaks won&apos;t be the death of diplomacy:  So, while the cables released by Wikileaks will give new meaning to the words &quot;modern history,&quot; and, while we now know more than we ever did before about the State Department&apos;s recent diplomacy, it&apos;s also worth remembering that State Department cables don&apos;t contain everything. And, yes, there will still be secrets in the future.        7.22pm: Incoming news from the Guardian&apos;s David Leigh, with cables showing that American and British diplomats fear Pakistan&apos;s nuclear weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists, aided by members of the Pakistan government, or lead to a devastating nuclear exchange with India:  The latest cache of US embassy cables released by WikiLeaks contains warnings that Pakistan is rapidly building its nuclear stockpile despite the country&apos;s growing instability and &quot;pending economic catastrophe&quot;.   7.32pm: Those wanting to hear more from the Guardian&apos;s David Leigh \u2013 such as Prince Andrew \u2013 can listen to David&apos;s appearance on Democracy Now!, in which he says there&apos;s much, much more to come.  7.50pm: In a slight change of pace, the Washington City Paper&apos;s Moe Tkacik has been closely following the WikiLeaks saga and is interested in how much US press coverage has been on the issues raised by the content of the leaks, and how much is about the flotsam surrounding it:  But before the latest document dump it appeared that a grand total of three stories, comprising 4108 words of the 35,662 words of 2010 [Washington] Post stories about which Wikileaks was the primary focus, actually required anything approaching a close read of any of the Wikileaked documents.   8.06pm: Perhaps the best piece of media analysis of the US embassy cable release has come from Politico&apos;s Keach Hagey, a must-read if you are interested in the nuts and bolts:  Such collaboration by major media organizations across international borders \u2014 both in agreeing to work together in publishing the material and in agreeing what material should be kept out \u2014 is new for journalism. &quot;I know of no international efforts like this, a global kind of collaboration,&quot; said Mark Feldstein, a professor at George Washington University&apos;s School of Media and Public Affairs... &quot;It&apos;s unprecedented and to be commended. The volume of the material that WikiLeaks obtained is unprecedented, so to tackle a subject this complicated is going to take more resources. And just as everything else has gone global \u2013 crime and multinational corporations \u2013 so we are starting to see the beginning of a more global investigative journalism,&quot; he said.   8.21pm: The Associated Press reports that the State Department has pulled out the plug between its classified information network and the rest of the government to avoid any more Wikileaking:  Reeling from disclosures of sensitive diplomatic messages, the State Department has disconnected access to its files from the US government&apos;s classified computer network. The move dramatically reduces the number of employees inside the government who can see important diplomatic messages. A State Department spokesman, PJ Crowley, said the decision was temporary, at least until workers correct what he called &quot;weaknesses in the system that have become evident because of this leak.&quot;       Julian Assange speaks at a press conference in London, September 2010.

He added that &quot;we have formally asked the State Department for assistance with that. That request was formally rejected.&quot; Asked what his &quot;moral calculus&quot; is to justify publishing the leaks and whether he considered what he was doing to be &quot;civil disobedience,&quot; Assange said, &quot;Not at all. This organization practices civil obedience, that is, we are an organization that tries to make the world more civil and act against abusive organizations that are pushing it in the opposite direction.&quot;   9.06pm: The Economist is mildly revising its snotty tone over the value of WikiLeaks. Its blogger MS writes:  I think WikiLeaks is an important organisation that&apos;s doing something the world needs. But like other human-rights and humanitarian organisations, such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Doctors Without Borders and the International Committee of the Red Cross, it needs to lay down some clear, public ethical guidelines about how and why it does what it does. And it needs to bring in a board of directors of people from a wide range of countries, backgrounds and institutions to review the organisation&apos;s conduct on ethical and other grounds.  Yes, a board of directors. That&apos;ll do it. MS ends by asking: &quot;Who&apos;s WikiLeaks? Besides Mr Assange, I don&apos;t know, and they&apos;re not really telling. Do you know? If so, start a wiki about it.&quot; (You mean, like this one?)  9.29pm: The New York Times&apos;s Mark Mazzetti has a cracking piece of embassy cable showing Blackwater&apos;s attempts to get into the pirate-fighting business:  In late 2008, Blackwater Worldwide, already under fire because of accusations of abuses by its security guards in Iraq and Afghanistan, reconfigured a 183-foot oceanographic research vessel into a pirate-hunting ship for hire and then began looking for business from shipping companies seeking protection from Somali pirates. The company&apos;s chief executive officer, Erik Prince, was planning a trip to Djibouti for a promotional event in March 2009, and Blackwater was hoping that the American Embassy there would help out, according to a secret State Department cable.        9.43pm: Micah Sifry (@Mlsif) tweets about an engaging cable from Kazakhstan, where a group of powerful oil executives talk with the US ambassador about corruption, and make a good point:  &quot;If Goldman Sachs executives can make $50 million a year and then run America&apos;s economy in Washington, what&apos;s so different about what we do?&apos; they ask.&quot;   10pm: Lots of new articles coming down the pipeline, any moment now.  10.05pm: Dave Weigel, blogging at Slate, looks at how Republican politicians are using WikiLeaks to indulge their spy-thriller fantasies.  As Republicans come into power, they&apos;re going to explore what can be done. They can&apos;t do much. But let&apos;s be honest. The quest to find some way to define Assange&apos;s group as terrorists is not about fighting terrorism. It&apos;s about indulging the fantasy, well put by Cornell law professor William Jacobson, of Assange being hunted down like a Robert Ludlum villain and possibly &quot;killed while resisting arrest.&quot;   10.18pm: Prince Andrew \u2013 or the Duke of WikiLeaks as he is officially known \u2013 appears again, thanks to the Guardian&apos;s Rob Evans and David Leigh, in this new article:  Prince Andrew used his royal position to demand a special briefing from the Serious Fraud Office weeks before launching a tirade against the agency&apos;s &quot;idiotic&quot; investigators at a lunch with businessmen in Kyrgyzstan.... Soon after, believing he was speaking in private to a group of sympathetic British businessmen, he appeared to condone bribery, and scorned the work of the SFO&apos;s anti-corruption investigators in investigating the Saudi royal family.   10.25pm: This just in: Interpol issues wanted notice for Julian Assange.

Pekala, for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 1. (S) Summary. On February 7, Acting U/S John Rood and his delegation met his French and British P3 counterparts, Philippe Carre and Mariot Leslie respectively, to discuss a broad range of nonproliferation, arms control and disarmament issues. Unusually, the French were closer to the U.S. than were the British on most issues. The greatest area of divergence involved a strong UK push for complete nuclear disarmament as a long term goal, including using verification measures in P5 countries. Rood and Carre expressed skepticism that this would have a significant impact either on aspiring proliferators or NGO disarmament advocates. They urged the British to join instead in a P3 strategy publicizing our strong nuclear disarmament records, promoting FMCT and START follow-on, and focusing on emerging threats such as nuclear terrorism. On missile defense, the British and French both praised our efforts with Russia as forward-leaning, supported our post-START approach, and expressed concern about Russia&apos;s moves to globalize the INF treaty. The British strongly supported the U.S. in seeking NATO endorsement in the Bucharest Communique of our MD efforts in Europe; the French, while remaining reluctant, agreed to support language in the Communique recognizing the threat and the utility of MD as one element of a response, and positively recognizing U.S. interceptors and radars as the core of a NATO capability. The P3 also discussed enforcement of the NPT vis-a-vis Iran, civil nuclear energy cooperation with India, cluster munitions, a proposed UK Arms Trade Treaty and difficulties with Egypt and China. The P3 plan to meet again in April. End Summary. ---------------------------------- A (MODEST) BRITISH PROPOSAL ---------------------------------- 2. (S) The meeting began with general agreement that, in the last 10 to 15 years, proliferation concerns have grown and that the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime is under stress. While aspiring proliferators such as Iran constitute the primary threat, the issue of energy security (and the acquisition of nuclear energy by non-nuclear states) has raised a new NPT dimension as well. U/S Rood stated that the USG was interested in creating &quot;rules of the road&quot; to allow for the peaceful use of nuclear energy within the NPT. Leslie agreed, adding that UK FM David Miliband was focusing on using the new demand for nuclear energy to look at safety issues as well as building capacity (some of which can be addressed through PSI). 3. (S) Participants agreed that Iran is the primary problem facing the states in the NPT regime. Carre stated that if the international community is unable to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear state, the NPT will lose credibility. U/S Rood agreed, adding that enforcement of the NPT regime must be the first priority, followed by addressing structural defects in the regime that allow nations to acquire enrichment technologies without any justification. Leslie said that, while no one was &quot;on Iran&apos;s side,&quot; some in the NAM, such as Brazil and Egypt, pay lip service to Iranian arguments for their own political reasons. All agreed that the P3 should do more to mobilize the various constituencies to promote better understanding of the threat and show that the stakes of withdrawing from the NPT are high. 4. (S) There was extensive discussion about a UK proposal to push for complete nuclear disarmament as a long-term goal, to include confidence-building measures by the P5 as a gesture of good will towards non-nuclear states suspicious of our nuclear reduction efforts. Leslie argued that there is a &quot;political danger&quot; within the UK and in NATO if the member states don&apos;t live up to the commitments in the NPT, including the final goal of a world without nuclear weapons. Leslie conceded U/S Rood&apos;s point that a P5 effort of this kind would not persuade Iran or other nuclear weapons aspirants to give up their nuclear ambitions, but she asserted that it would help bring countries such as Brazil, Egypt and South Africa to greater trust and support for the P5 in this area. The UK is planning to circulate a draft paper with proposals in four areas to help demonstrate the P5 commitment to reducing nuclear arsenals. These areas would concentrate on: (1) Work on definitions of nuclear terms and forces; (2) Greater transparency on warhead production and storage facilities (that would not need to include information on current location of warheads, but more general sharing of information about historic storage facilities); (3) Nuclear accident response; and (4) Verification of disarmament through peer review of technology, including demonstrating the practice of dismantling a nuclear warhead. If initiated, these proposals might build support for additional P5 initiatives like the PARIS 00000245 002 OF 004 nuclear fuel cycle program, Leslie said. 5. (S) U/S Rood and Carre expressed strong disagreement with the UK proposal, with U/S Rood emphasizing that it was far better for the P3 to adopt a positive agenda by emphasizing our strong nuclear disarmament record, pursuing FMCT and START follow-on, and focusing on emerging threats such as nuclear terrorism. U/S Rood questioned whether the UK proposal would be counter-productive. No one had challenged P5 nuclear disarmament announcements, but focusing on verification of P5 steps could cast doubt on those achievements and raise questions about aspects of the dismantling such as the retention of the plutonium pits at the center of the warhead (which actually renders it less susceptible to therft or diversion than would grinding down the material). Verification is a means of checking compliance; it is not relevant in the context of NPT Article VI, which sets no specific milestones to be checked and leaves it to the P5 to determine their own progress. U/S Rood asked about the demonstration effect on other countries: it could actually be de-stabilitizing for Pakistan, India and Israel to increase transparency through verification and steps advocated by the UK, such as publishing locations of nuclear weapons production and deployment. Carre agreed firmly and added that the UK proposal went far beyond acceptable parameters. ---------------------------------------- CHINESE AND RUSSIAN P5 PARTNERS ---------------------------------------- 6. (S) U/S Rood observed that P3 nuclear weapons arsenals had been reduced since signing the NPT in 1968, with the U.S. now at one-fourth of its stockpile at the peak of the Cold War, but meanwhile China is building up its nuclear arsenal and Russia is placing increasing emphasis on nuclear weapons in its doctrine. Unfortunately, the Chinese oppose a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT) because they wanted to preserve their freedom of action and ability to make more nuclear weapons. Leslie said that the UK is less concerned about the Chinese nuclear and conventional arms build-up than is the U.S., particularly with respect to Taiwan, but that London wants China involved in the FMCT process, even at the cost of a long transition period and agreement on what type of Chinese arms build-up would ultimately be acceptable. Carre advocated strengthened P5 cooperation and said that the Chinese want to be seen as &quot;equals&quot; with the other P5 members in ensuring world stability and security, and suggested this motivation could be played on to move China&apos;s behavior closer into alignment with its own more positive rhetoric. ----------------------------------------- EGYPT AND MULTILATERAL FORA ----------------------------------------- 7. (S) Leslie proposed having the P5 meet with Egypt before the next Prepcom to allow the GOE to vent its &quot;grievances&quot; and then perhaps engage more productively in the future. The UK fears that the Egyptians are &quot;gearing up for a fight&quot; if they don&apos;t believe their concerns are being properly addressed. U/S Rood observed that Egyptian tactics were backfiring; they received fewer votes at the September 2007 IAEA general conference than the year before and seemed genuinely surprised. Furthermore, it is not in their interest to remove the ambiguity of Israel&apos;s nuclear status which was stabilizing to the region. Carre agreed and said that there was no benefit to weakening the Israeli pledge not to be the first to use nuclear weapons in the Middle East. ----------------------------------------- INDIA ----------------------------------------- 8. (S) Carre opened the subject of civil nuclear energy cooperation by noting that France had recently initialed an agreement on this subject with the government of India. The provisions of the French-Indian agreement were similar to those in the U.S.-India agreement and the process had presented fewer problems than expected. The GOF had repeatedly emphasized to the GOI that India must obtain the approval of the IAEA and there would be no shortcuts or special exceptions. U/S Rood said that the USG strongly believes that language on safeguards in perpetuity should not be made conditional on fuel supply and we had informed the IAEA of our position. The GOI was still testing the will of the international community to find flexibility on this. Leslie affirmed that the UK was in agreement with both the U.S. and France on this issue and the British would be concerned if India obtained an agreement in which safeguards could lapse if fuel supplies were disrupted. She doubted that the GOI would complete the necessary steps this year. PARIS 00000245 003 OF 004 Furthermore, China was not blocking progress on Indian civil nuclear cooperation, but the UK fully expects that they will raise the case of Pakistan as soon as the Indian situation is resolved. ----------------------------------------- POST-START AND MISSILE DEFENSE ----------------------------------------- 9. (S) U/S Rood noted that the U.S. is continuing discussions with Russia on a post-START regime. Both Russia and U.S. did not want to simply extend the current agreement, which is both cumbersome and expensive. The U.S. wanted to draft a new agreement based on the Moscow Treaty. Unfortunately, Russia wanted conventional weapons to be limited under the agreement as well. The U.S. does not agree; as a compromise, in October we proposed a legally binding treaty with transparency and confidence-building measures. However, in the run up to the Russian presidential election, the Russians are in no mood to compromise. We do not support further efforts on global INF. 10. (S) On Missile Defense, Carre observed that the Russians realized the issue was more complicated than they initially believed. The U.S. offer not to activate the system until the threat matured showed that the MD system in Europe was not oriented towards Russia. Unfortunately, in the Russian government the more moderate diplomatic voices were marginalized by the power of the Russian military. Carre said that France had recognized the missile threat and agreed that missile defense was one element of a broad response to this threat. The French regard the U.S. interceptors and radars as the logical core of a NATO capability. However, an endorsement at NATO raises consequences that the French believe need to be carefully considered. For example, Bulgaria and Turkey were already raising the need for collective financing of an additional NATO-linked system, saying that it was required under NATO&apos;s treaty ensuring collective defense. 11. (S) In response, U/S Rood said that there are many examples where individual states have different capabilities that they bring to the Alliance that do not require common funding. A NATO endorsement of MD at Bucharest would simply note that the U.S. system in Europe exists and forms the core of a future Alliance capability. It does not commit the Alliance to any programmatic costs or a common funding mechanism. It is fully in keeping with other weapons programs developed by the allies and would ensure that there is no divisability of security. Leslie agreed, saying that if the threat is recognized and missile defense is effective in combating such a threat, then the alliance should not hesitate to endorse missile defense. The UK does not see the NATO endorsement as any commitment to actual expenditure, but merely a commitment to the principle. ------------------------------------ CLUSTER MUNITIONS ------------------------------------ 12. (S) U/S Rood emphasized that the international community was making progress in addressing cluster munitions concerns in the UN-authorized Convention on Conventional Weaposn (CCW) process. The USG was concerned about Norway&apos;s efforts to go outside this multilateral track via the &quot;Oslo Process.&quot; We believe this is both impractical and unconstructive and would prefer that other countries not participate in this outside mechanism. Leslie responded that the UK was participating in both the CCW and the Oslo Process as a &quot;tactical maneuver&quot; designed to keep activity within the bounds of their &quot;redlines&quot; and at the same time, keep the CCW alive. The UK wants to keep the &quot;smart&quot; type of cluster munitions and would not agree to phase out anything without a transitional period. At the same time, the UK is concerned about the impact of the Oslo Process on the aftermath of a conflict (foreseeing &quot;astronomical bills&quot; handed out to those who used cluster munitions in the past). Carre said that France could not afford to ignore the Oslo Process given the political power of the NGOs on this issue, but like the UK they hope to affect the debate as a participant. Cluster munitions have also attracted the attention of FM Kouchner and the French government is under &quot;heavy domestic pressure&quot; to take action. Unfortunately, once cluster munitions are declared to be unacceptable, it is hard to argue that we still need to use them for awhile. -------------------------------------- ARMS TRADE TREATY -------------------------------------- 13. (S) Finally, Leslie raised the issue of the proposed PARIS 00000245 004 OF 004 Arms Trade Treaty, saying their motives for support for this agreement were clear and they hoped it could be used to raise the standards of other states and create a more responsible arms trade. As the treaty would deal with export of arms, it should not run afoul of U.S. constitutional concerns as it would not limit the U.S. citizen constitutional right to bear arms. Carre agreed that there was scope for something to be done to further regulate arms transfers. U/S Rood observed that while encouraging responsible behavior in arms transfers in general was good, the risk with a treaty was than an unacceptably low standard for arms transfers would result. Rood also said that the U.S. had concerns about any potential impact on second amendment rights. 14. (U) This cable has been reviewed and cleared by Acting U/S Rood.

Amazon is reported to be ready to invest up to $150m (\u00a396m) in daily deals service LivingSocial, a move that would bring it into direct competition with Google, which is said to be readying a $6bn (\u00a33.8bn) deal for the market leader, Groupon. But if those involved shake hands, both deals could be forestalled by antitrust investigations. Groupon, founded only in 2008, has more than 33m subscribers worldwide, while LivingSocial \u2013 No 2 in the online voucher market \u2013 has more than 10m. Both companies also offer UK-based deals. Groupon, which has made three acquisitions of its own in recent weeks, would easily be Google&apos;s most expensive acquisition to date, ahead of its $3.1bn purchase of the advertising network DoubleClick in 2007. Chicago-based Groupon bought uBuyiBuy, Beeconomic and Atlaspost to increase its reach in the Far Each; on Wednesday it also launched specialised services based in Honk Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and the Philippines. &quot;We see enormous potential in the Asian marketplace,&quot; president Rob Solomon said in a statement. The Chinese internet search behemoth Baidu launched its own Groupon-like voucher service yesterday. The product, which is part of its Youa e-commerce platform, was launched with little fanfare and limited offerings, suggesting it wanted to preempt any announcements from fellow international heavyweights. Amazon&apos;s reported $150m investment for a 7% stake in LivingSocial, meanwhile, would value it at about $1bn (\u00a3640m). According to the Wall Street Journal&apos;s All Things Digital, LivingSocial&apos;s revenue is poised to hit more than $500m (\u00a3320m) in 2011. Groupon sends its members \u2013 2.5m of whom are inside the UK \u2013 daily emails with about 200 discounts for goods and services, such as Abelli photo books. The deals are activated only when a minimum number of people agree to make a purchase, allowing Groupon to negotiate more lucrative group discounts on some products. Chris Muhr, UK and Ireland managing director of Groupon, told the Telegraph that the margins will only reduce as the market expands. &quot;It&apos;s a very high profit margin, especially for an online business,&quot; he said. &quot;In the long run you have to compare it with other forms of marketing. We are in that game. We are a marketing tool. &quot;Compare us with Google. You have to factor in the [search engine] optimisation work you have to undergo to benefit from [Google] Adwords, and if you do that we are very cheap. As the industry grows and ages the margins could come down.&quot; The news site Mashable, quoting sources familiar with the two companies&apos; advertising budgets, says LivingSocial and Groupon each spend more than $1m a month on advertising through Google. But this spend would presumably be wiped out for Groupon if it were to be enveloped inside Google, just as the cost of acquiring advertising for its video service YouTube is not broken out separately. &quot;The more Google acquires, the more antitrust issues they are opening themselves up to,&quot; a source said to be familiar with the situation told Reuters. &quot;That has to be considered.&quot; None of the companies would comment on the reports today."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/dec/04/wikileaks-cables-google-china-hacking", "publicationDate": "2010-12-04T17:46:53Z", "tags": ["Google", "China", "Censorship", "Technology", "World news", "The US embassy cables", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["In an attempt to gain market share from local rival Baidu, it launched Google.cn, in which results relating to Tibet, Taiwan and the Tiananmen Square massacre were among those filtered out."], "title": "WikiLeaks cables blame Chinese government for Google hacking", "article": "  The hacking of Google that forced the search engine to withdraw from mainland China was orchestrated by a senior member of the communist politburo, according to classified information sent by US diplomats to Hillary Clinton&apos;s state department in Washington. The leading politician became hostile to Google after he searched his own name and found articles criticising him personally, leaked cables from the US embassy in Beijing say. That single act prompted a politically inspired assault on Google, forcing it to &quot;walk away from a potential market of 400 million internet users&quot; in January this year, amid a highly publicised row about internet censorship. The explosive allegation that the attack on Google came from near the top of the Communist party has never been made public until now. The politician allegedly collaborated with a second member of the politburo in an attempt to force Google to drop a link from its Chinese-language search engine to its uncensored google.com version. A cable from the Beijing embassy marked as secret records that attempts to break into the accounts of dissidents who used Google&apos;s Gmail system had been co-ordinated &quot;with the oversight of&quot; the two politburo members. The cyber assault was described to the Americans by a high-level Chinese source as &quot;100% political in nature&quot; and having &quot;nothing to do with removing Google... as a competitor to Chinese search engines&quot;. Last December Google said that it was hit by a &quot;highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure&quot;. Part of it was aimed at the Gmail accounts of &quot;Chinese human rights activists&quot; \u2013 although in a statement released in January, Google said that there was no evidence the hackers were successful. Shortly after the attack, Google chose to abandon mainland China. It relocated to Hong Kong, where it was able to run an uncensored version of its website in English and Chinese, ending an awkward attempt to reconcile partial adherence to Chinese requirements with western democratic values. While Google and the US suspected leading Chinese politicians were behind the hacking, neither the company nor the US government said so at the time. Diplomats even discussed whether China&apos;s most powerful man, Hu Jintao, the president, or his prime minister, Wen Jiabao, were &quot;aware of these actions&quot;. The secret note sent back to Washington concedes that &quot;it is unclear&quot; whether advance knowledge of the attack went right to the top. Google, whose motto is Don&apos;t Be Evil, entered China in 2006. In an attempt to gain market share from local rival Baidu, it launched Google.cn, in which results relating to Tibet, Taiwan and the Tiananmen Square massacre were among those filtered out. Google retained a link to the unfiltered Google.com on its Google.cn website, which prompted months of tension before the January incident. A cable from Beijing records that Google was already sounding the alarm to the most senior American diplomat in the country at the time. Dan Piccuta, the US charg\u00e9 d&apos;affaires, was told how the prominent politician had &quot;recently discovered that Google&apos;s worldwide site is uncensored&quot; after he &quot;allegedly entered his own name and found results critical of him&quot;. Shortly afterwards, according to the cable, the Chinese government ordered &quot;the three dominant SOE [state influence enterprises] telecoms [companies] to stop doing business with the company&quot;. However, that was not enough to persuade Google to back down. The US embassy was told that &quot;removing the link to Google.com is against the company&apos;s principles&quot;. It refused to block access to Google.com. China then upped its attacks on Google, according to another cable. A group of Chinese internet users reported that Google China was &quot;not effectively filtering pornographic sites&quot; and the Chinese government blocked access to Google for 24 hours. The documents reveal a close relationship between Google and the US authorities in China. In January, a few days after Google made the hacking public \u2013 without specifying who it believed was responsible \u2013 Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, made a speech in Washington entitled &quot;remarks on internet freedom&quot;. Clinton weighed in heavily on the side of Google, warning that &quot;countries that restrict free access to information or violate the basic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century&quot;. She called on the Chinese government to &quot;conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions&quot; without revealing that it was her own officials who believed the attack was co-ordinated from inside the Chinese politburo."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/04/wikileaks-cables-hillary-clinton-beijing", "publicationDate": "2010-12-04T21:30:02Z", "tags": ["The US embassy cables", "China", "Hillary Clinton", "US foreign policy", "US news", "Obama administration", "World news", "UK news", "Asia Pacific", "Kevin Rudd", "Australian politics"], "sentences": ["He described Chinese leaders as &quot;subrational and deeply emotional&quot; on Taiwan, a frequent source of tension with the US.", "Huntsman said: &quot;The Chinese continue to signal intense displeasure with US positions on issues from the Dalai Lama to Taiwan arms sales and internet freedom, which they then cite as reasons why they may not co-operate with the US on other issues.&quot; The ambassador stressed that China&apos;s economic growth offered &quot;enormous&quot; opportunities for the US to create growth and jobs and talked of possible options for increased co-operation."], "title": "WikiLeaks: Hillary Clinton's question: how can we stand up to Beijing?", "article": "Hillary Clinton revealed America&apos;s deep anxiety over China&apos;s growing economic power and hold on US finances by asking Australia&apos;s then prime minister: &quot;How do you deal toughly with your banker?&quot; The question, at a lunch with Kevin Rudd last March and reported in a US Department of State cable, underscores the evolving and often difficult relationship between the world&apos;s superpower and an increasingly mighty China. It is the largest holder of US treasury bonds, with around $870bn. Tensions are also highlighted in an economic dispatch, written by the US ambassador to Beijing last January, warning of a &quot;rough&quot; year for relations between the two countries and accusing China of hubris. His remarks presaged increasing tensions between the two countries over their currencies and fears of protectionism. The United States is pushing China to allow significant appreciation of the yuan, which it says is substantially undervalued, while Beijing is unhappy at the US Federal Reserve&apos;s loosening of monetary policy through quantitative easing. Another cable from last year quotes a senior Chinese official predicting that the midterm elections in America would increase pressure for protectionism in the US and expressing fears about the Fed &quot;printing lots of money&quot;. According to the note of Clinton&apos;s lunch with Rudd in Washington: &quot;The secretary affirmed the US desire for a successful China, with a rising standard of living and improving\u00a0democracy at a pace Chinese leaders could tolerate\u2026 The secretary also noted the challenges posed by China&apos;s economic rise, asking: &apos;How do you deal toughly with your banker?&apos;&quot; Rudd responded by calling himself &quot;a brutal realist on China&quot;, arguing for a policy of &quot;integrating China effectively into the international community and allowing it to demonstrate greater responsibility, all while also preparing to deploy force if everything goes wrong&quot;. He described Chinese leaders as &quot;subrational and deeply emotional&quot; on Taiwan, a frequent source of tension with the US. In the January memo, Jon Huntsman, the US ambassador to China, argued: &quot;Whereas 2009 was a year to build the US-China relationship, 2010 will be a year that tests it. &quot;Ten per cent US unemployment coupled with our huge trade deficit with China, China&apos;s increasing use of industrial policies to restrict market access, and an undervalued RMB [yuan], will bring greater tension to bilateral ties. The Google case adds fuel to the fire.&quot; Clinton made a speech about internet freedom shortly after Google announced it would no longer censor results in China, to the anger of Chinese leaders. Officials said the speech was planned before the Google case emerged. Huntsman said: &quot;The Chinese continue to signal intense displeasure with US positions on issues from the Dalai Lama to Taiwan arms sales and internet freedom, which they then cite as reasons why they may not co-operate with the US on other issues.&quot; The ambassador stressed that China&apos;s economic growth offered &quot;enormous&quot; opportunities for the US to create growth and jobs and talked of possible options for increased co-operation. China has overtaken Japan to become the world&apos;s second-largest economy and Huntsman noted that this offered a huge potential market for US goods and services. He listed possible &quot;carrots&quot; to dangle in front of Beijing, including a re-examination of export controls. Set beside that, he warned: &quot;USG [US government] complaints about discriminatory policies \u2013 absent a credible threat of retaliatory action or other leverage \u2013 are falling on increasingly deaf Chinese\u00a0ears. &quot;China&apos;s relatively strong economic position in the wake of the global financial crisis has intensified that trend. As has Chinese hubris that it can call the shots and determine the playbook under which it operates without disclosing the same to foreign firms. &quot;We may want to consider ways to toughen up our talking points and enhance the use \u2013 or perception of likely use \u2013 of other real &apos;sticks&apos; in order to achieve market-opening, job-creating objectives. This will require some consideration of just how much disruption in our economic relations we are willing to countenance if we must carry through on threats.&quot; Despite tit-for-tat tariff impositions, both countries have been cautious about damaging an economic relationship valuable to both sides. Huntsman suggested highlighting possible congressional action on &quot;hot button issues&quot; like the valuation of the yuan and carbon tariffs on Chinese\u00a0imports. Last month the US House of Representatives passed by an overwhelming majority a bill calling for tariffs to be imposed on countries with artificially low currencies. The US treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, has postponed his report on whether China is a currency manipulator, due last month. Geithner has since said that he believes that Beijing is committed to allowing the yuan to increase in\u00a0value. The dispatches also show Chinese concerns that domestic politics in the US could derail the economic relationship this year. In a meeting last November, vice-minister Liu He &quot;described the trade conflicts as &apos;terrible&apos;, with the small number of disputes having huge political and social impact in both countries. &quot;He believed that American labour unions and the upcoming midterm [2010] US congressional elections both increase pressure for trade protectionism in the US.&quot; Liu also told Robert Hormats, the state department&apos;s under-secretary for economics, energy and agricultural affairs, that he was &quot;a little worried&quot; about the US economy and the Federal Reserve &quot;printing lots of money&quot;. The concern about quantitative easing has since returned to the forefront of economic discussions. Another official at the meeting expressed concern that future inflation could erode the value of China&apos;s dollar\u00a0holdings."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/185826", "publicationDate": "2010-12-04T21:30:03Z", "tags": ["China", "The US embassy cables", "US foreign policy", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["In the years to come, our defense experts will need to closely monitor China&apos;s contingency plans and we will need to use every diplomatic and strategic tool we have to prevent intimidating moves toward Taiwan.", "BEIJING 00000022 007 OF 007 Taiwan and Human Rights ------------------------ 31.", "(C) Taiwan was the most vexing issue holding up the establishment of relations 30 years ago and remains the toughest issue for U.S.-China relations despite significant improvement in cross-Strait relations since the election of Taiwan President Ma.", "We should continue to support Taiwan and Mainland efforts to reduce tension by increasing Taiwan&apos;s &quot;international space&quot; and reducing the Mainland&apos;s military build-up across from Taiwan."], "title": "US embassy cables: 'Looking at the next 30 years of US-China relations'", "article": "Tuesday, 06 January 2009, 08:41C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 07 BEIJING 000022 SIPDIS DEPARTMENT FOR THE SECRETARY, DEPUTY SECRETARY, EAP A/S HILL, S/P, EAP/CM NSC FOR DWILDER EO 12958 DECL: 01/05/2034 TAGS PREL, PGOV, ECON, EFIN, MARR, MASS, CH SUBJECT: LOOKING AT THE NEXT 30 YEARS OF THE U.S.-CHINA RELATIONSHIPClassified By: Ambassador Clark T. Randt. Reasons 1.4 (b/d) 1. (C) January 1, 2009, marked the 30th Anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the People&apos;s Republic of China. This anniversary followed the PRC commemoration of roughly 30 years of China&apos;s &quot;reform and opening&quot; policy under Deng Xiaoping, which led to China&apos;s staggering economic growth. 2. (C) Thirty years ago, China was just emerging from the nightmare of the Cultural Revolution and 30 years of fratricidal misrule. China&apos;s economy was crippled by years of disastrous policies like the Great Leap Forward. The population was coming to terms with the world&apos;s most draconian population controls enacted in 1976 after decades of Maoist state-subsidies encouraging large families. Chinese foreign relations tended to be more influenced by ideological yardsticks than economic links since China had very few commercial links with the outside world. In 1979, Chinese urbanites on average made the equivalent of five dollars per month. 3. (C) Just as no one in 1979 would have predicted that China would become the United States&apos; most important relationship in thirty years, no one today can predict with certainty where our relations with Beijing will be thirty years hence. However, given the current significance of the bilateral relationship and the risk of missing opportunities to jointly address ongoing and predictable future challenges, below we look at trends currently affecting China with an eye to how those trends might affect relations. Several issues leap out, including China&apos; insatiable resource needs, our growing economic interdependence, China&apos;s rapid military modernization, a surge in Chinese nationalism, China&apos;s demographic challenges, and the PRC&apos;s increasing influence and confidence on the world stage. 4. (C) China has been plagued over the millennia by unforeseen events that devastated formerly prosperous regimes. Mongol invasion, the Black Death, uncountable peasant uprisings, warlords, tax revolts, communist dictatorship, colonialism, famine, earthquakes and other plagues were largely unforeseen by the China watchers of the past. This report focuses generally on more optimistic projections. Given China&apos;s history, however, the United States should also gird itself for the possibility that China will fall short of today&apos;s mostly sanguine forecasts. Resource Consumption -------------------- 5. (C) Popular and scholarly works in recent years highlight China&apos;s growing demand for natural resources and the possible impact that China&apos;s pursuit of resources will have on its foreign policy. Since economic reforms began in the late 1970s, industrial and exchange rate policies have fueled investment in resource-intensive heavy industries in China&apos;s coastal region, which currently account for approximately 55 percent of the country&apos;s total energy consumption today. A construction boom over the past decade has also stimulated growth in heavy industries. China is now a leading steel producer and currently accounts for 50 percent of the world&apos;s annual cement production. Reflecting China&apos;s emphasis on resource-intensive industries, China&apos;s energy utilization rate grew faster than its GDP between 2002 and 2006. In 1990, China consumed 27 quadrillion British Thermal Units (BTUs) of energy, accounting for 7.8 percent of global consumption. In 2006, it consumed 68.6 quadrillion BTUs or 15.6 percent of the global total. According to U.S. Department of Energy statistics, by 2030 China will account for 145.5 quadrillion BTUs or 20.7 percent of global energy consumption. 6. (C) China&apos;s oil demand has grown substantially over the last 30 years. In 1980, China consumed 1.7 million barrels of oil per day, almost all of which was produced domestically. In 2006, China consumed 7.4 million barrels per day, second only to the United States. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China&apos;s oil consumption will reach 16.5 million barrels per day in 2030. More than two thirds of the increased demand will come from the BEIJING 00000022 002 OF 007 transport sector as vehicle ownership rates rise. China became a net importer of oil in 1993, and it now relies on imports to meet a growing portion of its fossil fuel needs. The IEA forecasts that China&apos;s oil import dependence will rise from 50 percent this year to 80 percent by 2030, as domestic oil production peaks early in the next decade. To strengthen the country&apos;s future energy security, the Chinese Government has adopted a &quot;go out&quot; policy that encourages national oil companies (NOCs) to acquire equity stakes in foreign oil and gas production. Today, state-owned Chinese oil giants CNPC/PetroChina, CNOOC, and Sinopec can be found in Sudan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Venezuela, Angola, and the Caspian Basin. 7. (C) China has also increased its reliance on imported minerals, and many analysts have attributed the global commodities boom of recent years in part to China&apos;s growing demand. Between 1980 and 2006, China became the world&apos;s largest consumer of iron, copper and aluminum. Chinese conglomerates are ubiquitous in sub-Saharan Africa exploiting mineral wealth there, and Chinese multinationals have significant investments in Australian mineral and uranium production. 8. (C) China&apos;s reliance on coal has come at an appalling environmental cost. This year, China surpassed the United States in carbon emissions, and it will soon become the world&apos;s biggest energy consumer. Between now and 2030, the IEA estimates, China will need to add 1,312 gigawatts of power generating capacity, more than the total current installed capacity in the United States. Coal-fired power generation, a major source of air pollution, accounts for approximately 78 percent of China&apos;s total electricity supply, and it will likely remain the predominant fuel in electricity generation for at least the next 20 years. Analysts predict that domestic coal production will peak in the next 15 to 25 years. China already became a net importer of coal in 2007, and coal imports are expected to grow in the coming decades to meet growing demand in China&apos;s coastal provinces. 9. (C) The Chinese Government recognizes the need to reduce dependence on coal, and it is pursuing policies to diversify its energy mix. China is already the largest producer of renewable energy in the world, with major investments in large-scale hydro and wind power projects. Nuclear and natural gas power will also account for a greater proportion of energy production, but under current projections, efforts to diversify China&apos;s energy mix will not have a large enough impact to curb greenhouse gas emissions growth. 10. (C) China&apos;s energy intensive growth has also had tragic consequences for public health. By most measurements, at least half of the world&apos;s most polluted major cities are in China. Rural residents, in particular farmers, have been affected by water pollution and dwindling water supplies, which are frequently redirected for industrial use. Respiratory disease, water-borne illness and tainted food scares are facts of modern life in the country. According to a recent WHO study, diseases caused by indoor and outdoor air pollution kill 656,000 Chinese citizens every year. Another 95,600 deaths are attributed annually to polluted drinking water. 11. (C) China&apos;s increasing reliance on imported natural resources has foreign policy ramifications and provides opportunities for the United States. A China that is increasingly dependent on Middle Eastern oil might be more likely to support policies that do not destabilize the Middle East. Take Iran, for instance. We have long been frustrated that China has resisted (with Russia) tough sanctions aimed at curbing Iran&apos;s nuclear program. In the future, a China increasingly dependent on foreign energy supplies may recalculate the risk a nuclear Iran would pose to the greater Persian Gulf region&apos;s capacity to export oil. 12. (C) Another opportunity presented by China&apos;s increasing resource consumption is in the joint development of technological responses to reduce carbon emissions and to diminish the public health impact of industrial growth. Scientific publications around the world conclude that the projected rate of global energy and natural resource BEIJING 00000022 003 OF 007 consumption is unsustainable. Experts warn that we must find alternative forms of energy in order to avert calamities posed by global climate change. International efforts to develop and significantly utilize renewable energy, clean up our shared global environment, and conserve our remaining raw materials will not be effective without meaningful Chinese participation. As the world&apos;s preeminent technological power and as a leader in multilateral energy and scientific organizations, the United States is in a unique position to work with China to overcome these challenges. Economic Interdependence and Chinese Demographics --------------------------------------------- ---- 13. (C) In the next fifteen years, while China&apos;s overall population is predicted to stabilize, its urban population will likely grow to almost 1 billion, an increase (of 300 million people) equal to the entire current population of the United States. China plans to build 20,000 to 50,000 new skyscrapers over the next two decades -- as many as ten New York cities. More than 170 Chinese cities will need mass transit systems by 2025, more than twice the number now present in all of Europe. China is now surpassing Germany as the world&apos;s third largest economy and is projected to overtake Japan within the next five years. By the end of the next thirty years, China&apos;s economy could rival the United States in overall scale (although its per capita income will likely only be one quarter of the United States&apos;). 14. (C) Behind these outward symbols of success will be an increasingly complicated economic picture. Since 1979, by reversing the misguided economic policies of the Mao era, liberalizing labor markets and prices, opening to foreign investment, and taking advantage of the West&apos;s consumer-driven policies, China has maintained fast growth. However, the set of circumstances that allowed such impressive growth rates will no longer exist in the future. 15. (C) Many speculate that China has reached the limit to easy productivity gains by rationalizing the state-planned economy. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects China&apos;s annual growth to slow from around 10 percent in the last 30 years to 4.5 percent by 2020. After 2015 when the labor force peaks as a share of the population, labor costs will rise faster. This will increasingly make other countries like India and Vietnam more attractive for labor-intensive investment. In addition, workers will have to support a growing number of retirees. Early retirement ages combined with the urban one-child limits creates the so-called &quot;4-2-1&quot; social dilemma: each worker will have to support four grandparents, two parents and one child. Savings rates will start falling as the elderly draw down their retirement funds. 16. (C) China will have to manage an economy increasingly dependent on domestic consumption and service industries for growth. Already, urbanites are buying 1,000 new cars per day, making China the world&apos;s largest Internet and luxury goods market, and traveling abroad in growing numbers. By 2025, China will have the world&apos;s largest middle class, and China will likely have completed the transition from the majority rural population of today to a majority urban population. These consumers of tomorrow will likely flock to products from around the world as their North American, European and Japanese counterparts do today, providing new opportunities for American business. If incomes continue to grow, it is likely that the Chinese middle class will react like educated urbanites in other countries by exerting pressure on the Government to improve its dismal performance on environmental protection, food and product safety. We are already seeing increased public activism over such issues today. 17. (C) China will face a challenge in the next thirty years encouraging this urban consumption while dealing with the social equality issues inherent in a rural population where over 200 million people still live on less than a dollar a day. China will also have to find a way to improve the lot of between 150 and 230 million migrant workers who today must leave their children and aging parents behind in their home villages to travel to the industrial centers of the BEIJING 00000022 004 OF 007 relatively developed coastal regions to work in factories or on construction projects. 18. (C) With China&apos;s phenomenal growth has come increased economic interdependence. This will likely increase, although some of the less-balanced elements of China&apos;s economic interactions should be mitigated. Rising consumption rates should work to lower China&apos;s trade surplus as well as its overabundance of foreign exchange reserves. More assets controlled by corporations and individuals, as opposed to the government, will diversify outward investment, reducing political control by Beijing, but also the utility of political suasion for U.S. policymakers interested in effecting the flow of capital to international hotspots. Chinese Nationalism and Confidence on the International Stage --------------------------------------------- ---------------- 19. (C) As one of two main pillars of post-Mao Chinese Communist Party rule (the other being sustained economic growth), Chinese nationalism is growing and should be monitored closely. As witnessed during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Chinese are increasingly proud of the tremendous strides their country has made in recent years. More and more young people see China as having &quot;arrived&quot; and might possess the confidence and willingness to assume the responsibilities of a major power. However, as was evident during protests over the 1999 mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, the 2004 protests over Japanese textbooks, and more recently the anti-France diatribes that followed the roughing-up of a disabled Olympic torch bearer in Paris by Free Tibet supporters, this nationalism can also lead to jingoism. Chinese leaders of a system with few outlets to express political sentiments are faced with trying to give vent to the occasional uprising of nationalistic anger without letting it get out of hand or allowing it to focus on the failings of the central leadership. 20. (C) With notable exceptions like Zhou Enlai, Chinese foreign policy practitioners thirty years ago had little practical experience dealing with the West. Since then, Chinese diplomats and subject matter experts are increasingly well-educated, well-traveled and well-respected. Chinese diplomats at international fora such as the UN and the WTO have become adept at using procedural rules to attain diplomatic or commercial ends. This trend will likely continue in the coming decades, increasing the likelihood of American decision makers finding more able adversaries when we disagree on issues, but also more able partners where we can agree to jointly tackle a problem of mutual concern such as nonproliferation, alternative energy or pandemic influenza. 21. (C) While still reluctant to claim China is a global leader, Chinese officials are gradually gaining confidence as a regional power. By the end of the next 30 years, China should no longer be able to portray itself as the representative of lesser developed countries. This does not mean that it will necessarily identify with the more developed, mainly Western countries; it well might choose to pursue some uniquely Chinese path. In the coming 30 years, a U.S. President might be involved in negotiations with a Chinese leader seeking to reshape global financial institutions like the IMF or the WTO or establish rival institutions for non-Western countries in order to mitigate domestic Chinese concerns. Even so, China&apos;s growing position as a nation increasingly distinct from the less-developed world may expand our common interests and make it easier for the United States to convince China to act like a responsible global stakeholder. 22. (C) Foreign assistance coordination is another area of opportunity. China is rapidly ramping up its global economic presence, not only via resource extraction ventures and cheap exports, but increasingly via direct investment and assistance. This investment and assistance are welcome in most less-developed countries, whether in Africa or Southeast Asia, and particularly in countries where China&apos;s longstanding policy of &quot;no strings attached no political interference&quot; appeals to democratically-challenged dictators BEIJING 00000022 005 OF 007 and kleptocrats. However, China is already facing blowback as a result of its more cavalier approach to issues that more scrupulous donors have wrestled with for decades. Scant attention paid to worker safety, job opportunities for local people, environmental protection, and political legitimacy has had negative consequences for China on multiple occasions, from a tarnished international image and being used as a political whipping boy by opposition groups in democratic countries to unpaid loans, expropriated investments, and even the deaths of Chinese expatriates. As a result, China is beginning to understand the merits of international assistance standards not for altruistic reasons, but for achieving China&apos;s own bottom-line imperatives of a more secure international position and better-protected economic interests in third countries. This realization, coupled with China&apos;s growing economic clout on the world stage, make it quite possible that, in the next 30 years, China will come to be identified by the average citizen in less developed countries not as &quot;one of us&quot; but as &quot;one of them.&quot; 23. (C) In all likelihood, a new-found (if still somewhat grudging) PRC interest in internationally accepted donor principles such as transparency, good governance, environmental and labor protections, and corporate social responsibility will have matured in 30 years&apos; time, making China a reliable partner for the United States, other donor countries, and international organizations in alleviating poverty, developing infrastructure, improving education and fighting infectious disease. And as one of the world&apos;s premier economic powers, China can be expected to have all but discarded its over-worn and outdated &quot;non-interference&quot; rhetoric in the face of massive Chinese investment assets and other economic interests abroad. 24. (C) As evidenced by Chinese policies toward pariah states like Sudan, Zimbabwe, Burma and Iran, China is still willing to put its need for markets and raw materials above the need to promote internationally accepted norms of behavior. However, the possible secession of southern Sudan (where much of the country&apos;s oil is found) from the repressive Khartoum-based Bashir regime, the erratic treatment of foreign economic interests in Zimbabwe by Robert Mugabe, the dangers to regional safety and stability posed by Burma&apos;s dysfunctional military junta, and the threat to China&apos;s energy security that a nuclear-armed Iran would represent have given Beijing cause to re-calibrate its previously uncritical stance toward these international outlaws. If China&apos;s integration into global economic and security structures continues apace, we would expect its tolerance for these sorts of disruptive players to decrease proportionately. 25. (C) China&apos;s work in the Six-Party Talks and the Shanghai Cooperative Organization may provide guidance as to how to accelerate this trend. China plays a leading and often responsible and constructive role in both of these multilateral groups. Future U.S. policy-makers might usefully consider additional international mechanisms that include both U.S. and Chinese membership such as the proposed Northeast Asia Peace and Security Mechanism that may grow out of the Six-Party Talks. The Chinese themselves have suggested a Six-Party Talks-like grouping to address the Iran nuclear issue, perhaps a P5-plus-1-plus-Iran. In the future, we may wish to consider the United States joining the East Asia Summit (EAS). 26. (C) Likewise, as the Chinese economy takes up a larger portion of the global economy, it inevitably will become increasingly affected by the decisions of international economic and financial institutions. Similarly, China&apos;s economic decisions will have global implications, and its cooperation will become essential to solving global-scale problems. Drawing China constructively into regional and global economic and environmental dialogues and institutions will be essential. More and more experts see the utility of establishing an Asia-Pacific G-8, to include China, Japan, and the United States plus India, Australia, Indonesia, South Korea and Russia; others say the time is ripe to include China as a member of a G-9. Giving China a greater voice is seen as a way to encourage China to assume a larger burden in BEIJING 00000022 006 OF 007 supporting the international economic and financial system. Role of the Military -------------------- 27. (C) The disparate possibilities exist that in the coming decades the PLA will evolve into a major competitor, maintain only a regional presence or become a partner capable of joining us and others to address peacekeeping, peace-enforcing, humanitarian relief and disaster mitigation roles around the world. China may be content to remain only a regional power, but Deng Xiaoping&apos;s maxim urging China to hide its capabilities while biding its time should caution us against predicting that the PLA&apos;s long-term objectives are modest. In the years to come, our defense experts will need to closely monitor China&apos;s contingency plans and we will need to use every diplomatic and strategic tool we have to prevent intimidating moves toward Taiwan. In the coming years, Chinese defense capabilities will continue to improve. The PLA thirty years from today will likely have sophisticated anti-satellite weapons, state-of-the-art aircraft, aircraft carriers and an ability to project force into strategic sea lanes. 28. (C) Thirty years ago the PLA was a bloated political organization with antiquated equipment and tactics. Today, the PLA is leaner and is becoming a modern force. Chinese military and paramilitary units have participated in UN-sponsored peacekeeping missions in East Timor, Kosovo, Haiti and Africa. In December 2008, for the first time, the PLA Navy deployed beyond the immediate waters surrounding the country to participate in anything beyond a goodwill tour to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa. It is likely that China will continue to support UN-sponsored PKOs, and if the piracy expedition is successful, China might follow up with expeditions to future piracy hotspots such as the Strait of Malacca or elsewhere. 29. (C) Over the past thirty years, Chinese officials have come to begrudgingly acknowledge the benefits to East Asia resulting from the U.S. military presence in the Pacific, especially the extent that a U.S. presence in the Pacific is an alternative to a more robust Japanese military presence. A peaceful resolution of the threat posed by North Korea might cause China to call for an end to the U.S. base presence on the Korean Peninsula. Perceived threats to China&apos;s security posed by Japan&apos;s participation in missile defense or by future high-tech U.S. military technologies might cause tomorrow&apos;s Chinese leaders to change their assessment and to exert economic pressures on U.S. allies like Thailand or the Philippines to choose between Beijing and Washington. 30. (C) Whatever the state of our future relations with China, we will need to understand more about the Chinese military. Multilateral training and exercises are constructive ways to promote understanding and develop joint capabilities that could be used in real-life situations. In the coming years, the Chinese may be called upon to participate in regional peacekeeping and humanitarian relief exercises. Some of these could be handled under UN auspices, but others could be bilateral or multilateral. For instance, Cobra Gold, which is held every year in Thailand, is America&apos;s foremost military exercise in Asia. It has a peacekeeping component and since the December 2004 tsunami in Indian Ocean has included a humanitarian relief element. With proper buy-in by the Pentagon and PACOM, we could create a program to engage the PLA more directly both with our military and with friendly militaries in the region. Modest efforts at expanding search and rescue capabilities on the high seas, developing common forensic techniques for use in mass casualty events, conducting exercises with PLA units tasked with responding to civil nuclear emergencies, or table-top exercises for U.S. and Chinese junior officers could be steps that promote trust with little risk. At the same time, more frequent, regularly scheduled high-level reciprocal visits between Chinese and U.S. security officials might eventually lead to a constructive strategic security policy dialogue on nonproliferation, counterterrorism and other issues. BEIJING 00000022 007 OF 007 Taiwan and Human Rights ------------------------ 31. (C) Taiwan was the most vexing issue holding up the establishment of relations 30 years ago and remains the toughest issue for U.S.-China relations despite significant improvement in cross-Strait relations since the election of Taiwan President Ma. It will remain a delicate topic for the foreseeable future. We should continue to support Taiwan and Mainland efforts to reduce tension by increasing Taiwan&apos;s &quot;international space&quot; and reducing the Mainland&apos;s military build-up across from Taiwan. 32. (C) Thirty years ago, the Chinese state interfered in virtually every aspect of its citizens&apos; lives. An individual&apos;s work unit provided housing, education, medical care and a burial plot. Reeducation sessions and thought reform were common, churches and temples were closed, and average citizens had little access to the outside world. Today, Chinese have far greater ability to travel, read foreign media and worship. Nonetheless, the overall human rights situation falls well short of international norms. Today, China&apos;s growing cadre of well-educated urbanites generally avoids politics and seems more interested in fashion and consumerism than in ideology; after all, outside-the-box political thinking, much less activism, remains dangerous. However, any number of factors in the future ranging from rising unemployment among recent college graduates, or growing discontent over the income divide separating rich urbanites from poor peasants, to discontent among the mass of migrant workers could lead to unrest and increased political activism. The Chinese Government still responds with brutal force to any social, religious, political or ideological movement it perceives as a potential threat. Chinese political leaders&apos; occasional nods toward the need for political reform and increased democracy suggest a realization that the current one-party authoritarianism has its weak points, but do not promise sufficient relaxation of party control to create a more dynamically stable polity in the long term. 33. (C) While the U.S. model of democracy is not the only example of a tolerant open society, we should continue to push for the expansion of individual freedoms, respect for the rule of law and the establishment of a truly free and independent judiciary and press as being necessities for a thriving, modern society and, as such, in China&apos;s own interests. Someday, China will realize political reform. When that day comes, we will want to be remembered by Chinese for having helped China to advance.

(C/Rel Aus) SUMMARY. In a 75-minute lunch following Rudd&apos;s White House meeting, the Secretary and PM Rudd discussed Afghanistan, Pakistan, China, Russia, and Rudd&apos;s Asia Pacific community initiative. Rudd complimented the United States&apos; recent &quot;creative play&quot; on Iran. The Secretary noted the President&apos;s video message and said inviting Iran to participate in the March 31 Hague Conference on Afghanistan had caused confusion in Tehran. END SUMMARY. ------------------------ AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN ------------------------ 5. (C/Rel Aus) The Secretary and PM Rudd agreed on the importance of making progress in building up the Afghan National Army. Rudd confirmed FM Stephen Smith would represent Australia at the March 31 Hague Conference on Afghanistan, where the Secretary indicated the United States would lay out specific goals. 6. (C/Rel Aus) The Secretary and PM Rudd discussed the need to turn Pakistan away from its &quot;obsessive focus&quot; on India, towards the problems in the west of the country, noting even total success in Afghanistan would be unraveled if Pakistan were to fall apart. Rudd indicated Australia was willing and able to help, especially in special operations and counterinsurgency areas, as soon as Pakistan was willing to accept help, but argued the necessary economic development assistance and capacity-building in Pakistan&apos;s security forces could only happen once the elites came to recognize the problem. The best way to cause such a realization would be to hold up a mirror showing what Pakistan would look like in five years if no action is taken. While China would undoubtedly be reluctant to do more, Rudd continued, a similar China-Pakistan mirror-holding exercise would be beneficial as well. The Secretary agreed China needed to be more engaged in Afghanistan and Pakistan, opining Chinese leaders were growing concerned that extremists&apos; success in Pakistan could be a harbinger of similar success in China&apos;s west. She noted that Chinese FM Yang would attend the March 31 Hague Conference. ----- CHINA ----- 7. (C/Rel Aus) PM Rudd said Chinese Politburo member Li Changchun had indicated Chinese leaders viewed the Secretary&apos;s recent visit to Beijing as a success and felt they could deal with the Obama Administration. The Secretary affirmed the U.S. desire for a successful China, with a rising standard of living and improving democracy at a pace Chinese leaders could tolerate, noting the impressive achievements in Chinese democracy at the village level. We wanted China to take more responsibility in the global economic sphere, create more of a social safety net for its people, and construct a better regulatory framework for the goods China manufactures. The Secretary also noted the challenges posed by China&apos;s economic rise, asking, &quot;How do you deal toughly with your banker?&quot; 8. (C/Rel Aus) Calling himself &quot;a brutal realist on China,&quot; Rudd argued for &quot;multilateral engagement with bilateral vigor&quot; -- integrating China effectively into the international community and allowing it to demonstrate greater responsibility, all while also preparing to deploy force if everything goes wrong. Rudd said the Australian intelligence community keeps a close watch on China&apos;s military modernization, and indicated the forthcoming Australian Defence White Paper&apos;s focus on naval capability is a response to China&apos;s growing ability to project force. Rudd would send the Secretary a copy of his April 2008 speech at Peking University in which he had argued that China&apos;s idea of a harmonious world, based on the philosophy of Kang Youwei, and the West&apos;s concept of a responsible stakeholder were not incompatible. 9. (C/Rel Aus) Reviewing recent Chinese leaders, Rudd assessed that Hu Jintao &quot;is no Jiang Zemin.&quot; No one person dominated Chinese leadership currently, although Hu&apos;s likely replacement, Xi Jinping, had family ties to the military and might be able to rise above his colleagues. Rudd explained that the Standing Committee of the Politburo was the real decision-making body, which then passed decisions for implementation by the State Council. 10. (C/Rel Aus) Rudd noted Chinese leaders were paranoid about both Taiwan and Tibet, but with subtle differences; leaders&apos; reactions on Taiwan were sub- rational and deeply emotional, whereas hard-line policies on Tibet were crafted to send clear messages to other ethnic minorities. Rudd indicated that he had suggested to Chinese leaders that they consider a &quot;small &apos;a&apos; autonomy deal with the Dalai Lama.&quot; While giving little prospect of success, Rudd contended the best chance would be if someone of the Secretary&apos;s stature had &quot;a quiet conversation&quot; with the Politburo Standing Committee member responsible for Tibet sometime after the furor over the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lama&apos;s exile subsides, and suggested a &quot;third track discussion&quot; of the long-term modalities for how such an autonomy deal could work. ------ RUSSIA ------ 11. (C/Rel Aus) In light of his upcoming meeting with Russian President Medvedev, Rudd asked for insights into Russian political dynamics. The Secretary said Medvedev was looking for legitimacy and positioning vis--vis PM Putin even as Putin was dissatisfied with the role he has carved out for himself - behind the scenes puppeteer and lead on energy policy - but somewhat bound through 2012 since he had ceded other issues to Medvedev. Asked whether the United States viewed Medvedev as more liberal than Putin, the Secretary indicated Medvedev&apos;s desire for status and respect could cause him to be. Rudd agreed, opining Russians&apos;awareness of how their leaders were viewed internationally could help improve Medvedev&apos;s domestic standing. The Secretary also explained U.S. efforts to reset the layered and complex relationship and briefly outlined a list of issues we wanted to work together on, including counterterrorism, arms reduction, Afghanistan, and human rights. ----------------------- Asia Pacific Community ----------------------- 12. (C/Rel Aus) Noting Russia&apos;s interest in being included in Asian regional architecture, Rudd explained the thinking behind his Asia Pacific community (APC) initiative mostly as an effort to ensure Chinese dominance of the East Asia Summit (EAS) did not result in a &quot;Chinese Monroe Doctrine&quot; and an Asia without the United States. Expressing appreciation for U.S. reengagement in the region, Rudd said China could succeed only if the United States ceded the field. He recognized the lack of appetite for a new organization and said the APC could be created by expanding APEC&apos;s mandate or the EAS&apos; membership. Rudd emphasized the long-term horizon of his initiative (his vision is for an APC established by 2020) and hoped his APC could fulfill a role similar to the Helsinki Commission in Europe, focusing at least initially on low-level common security policy and coordination, perhaps starting with humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. Rudd promised to send a draft-stage journal article outlining his APC initiative in more detail.

Huntsman for reasons 1.4 (b), (d) and (e). 1.(C) SUMMARY. We face a challenging year ahead in U.S.-China relations. Ten percent U.S. unemployment coupled with our huge trade deficit with China, China,s increasing use of industrial policies to restrict market access, and an undervalued RMB, will bring greater tension to bilateral ties. The Google case adds fuel to the fire. In this context, it is critical that we find ways to better advance our bilateral economic policy. This will require sustained, focused interaction on a daily basis with the Chinese, but also serious thinking about what can best be accomplished in the run-up to and at key meetings like the S&amp;ED and JCCT. We need to find ways to keep the relationship positive, but even more important to ensure the American worker, in particular, reaps the benefits of our bilateral economic engagement. 2.(C) We offer below some ideas on how we can move ahead on a concerted, targeted U.S. effort to boost U.S. job-creating exports of goods and services to China as well as increased job-creating Chinese investment and tourism to the United States. While we will continue to aggressively negotiate removal of Chinese barriers, we will need as well to get Chinese buy-in to several job-boosting initiatives. There are even things we can do ourselves unilaterally. Taken together, measures would include: - expanding sector-specific public private partnerships, - offering SMEs China-specific support, - building or retooling existing export promotion mechanisms, - making educational offerings in the U.S. more attractive (and in the process giving new generations of Chinese a reason for wanting to be in the U.S. market), - increasing pull factors for Chinese tourism to and investment in the U.S., and - enhancing the use of the Internet and other electronic means of communication in Chinese. 3.(C) We are aware that in a resource constrained environment, some of these will cost money, but we judge that the benefits will outweigh the costs and have a significant job-creating component. Some suggestions may be more palatable than others, and costs will vary widely, but we emphasize again that the potential benefits of each are substantial. Of course we need to do a better job in helping Americans understand that the China trade relationship can actually be a good story for U.S. jobs and pay dividends far beyond the trade sector. One final note: we accent the positive here in terms of what we can do but we certainly do not neglect that the continuing need to use available trade remedies and WTO consistent retaliatory action to ensure fairness and transparency. END SUMMARY. A ROUGH YEAR AHEAD, BUT OPPORTUNITIES ARE ENORMOUS --------------------------------------------- ----- 4.(C) Whereas 2009 was a year to build the U.S.-China relationship, 2010 will be a year that tests it. Strong Chinese economic and export growth coupled with an artificially undervalued RMB will further heighten focus on our huge trade deficit with China. Widespread perceptions that China,s industrial policies are rolling back market access add to the overall sense that China plays unfairly in the global marketplace. Other emerging issues, like Google,s problems and new rules on indigenous innovation, create a drumbeat of bad news stories for firms seeking to do BEIJING 00000231 002 OF 007 business in China. And as backdrop, the Chinese continue to signal intense displeasure with U.S. positions on issues from the Dalai Lama to Taiwan arms sales and Internet freedom, which they then cite as reasons why they may not cooperate with the U.S. on other issues. 5.(C) Yet, with ten percent U.S. unemployment, more than ever before we must ensure that our relations with China continue to pay real dividends -- especially in creating jobs for Americans. China is the world,s fastest growing major economy and should be providing opportunities for U.S. goods and services exports. Chinese companies, thanks to government-backed loans, monopolies and preferential treatment, are awash in cash and should be a source for investment in the U.S. economy -- investment that would help maintain and create jobs in the U.S. And, China,s rapidly growing middle and upper classes, while still only representing a fraction of its population, measure many tens of millions. They should provide an enormous pool of potential consumers of U.S. goods and services as well as tourism and education in the U.S. 6.(C) Virtually every major U.S. company has a presence in China. They recognize the potential and are trying hard to work around the obstacles to market access that China erects. For many of them, China was their sole profit-center during last year,s global economic downturn. However, for the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are the engine of job creation in the United States, exporting to or doing business in China is still a daunting prospect. Overt market access barriers and regulatory constraints at the national and sub-national level increasingly and blatantly tilt the playing field to Chinese companies&apos; advantage. Chinese policies make it difficult to succeed in its market unless you establish a local presence, including production, something for which SMEs generally have neither the capital nor expertise. The opacity of China,s legal and regulatory systems and widespread official corruption also serve as barriers to U.S. businesses -- especially SMEs -- seeking to export to, or invest in, China. The lack of effective IPR protection, import-substitution policies, standards discriminate against foreign products and create obstacles to licensing of technology, and central and provincial/local government incentives to &quot;buy local,&quot; additionally skew the playing field against foreign firms. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN: PERCEPTIONS OF U.S. DISINCENTIVES TO TRAVEL, INVESTMENT --------------------------------------------- - 7.(C) Many in China perceive the U.S. as &quot;closed&quot; to Chinese and Chinese companies. Chinese businesspersons looking at investment opportunities around the globe are confused and intimidated by the different investment regulations and promotional activities in the fifty U.S. states. Businesspersons, potential tourists and students remain confused by U.S. visa regulations and, particularly in contrasting them with those of our competitors in Japan and Europe, perceive them as more restrictive than they actually are, even seeing them as &quot;hostile&quot; to Chinese travelers. Many Chinese and some U.S. firms complain that U.S. export controls are out-dated and costing us business as Chinese buyers travel to Europe to buy the same goods or services they cannot buy from American suppliers. JOB-BOOSTING APPROACHES: PROPOSED SOLUTIONS ------------------------------------------- 8.(C) There are no easy solutions to many of these challenges. However, we offer a range of possible initiatives and policy measures for interagency consideration that could help advance our efforts to maximize job-creating benefits from our relations with China. The proposals we BEIJING 00000231 003 OF 007 offer below include ones that would require Chinese buy in as well as some that the U.S. could initiate unilaterally. They are not exhaustive nor are they intended to substitute for continued aggressive negotiation of market access, but instead are meant to provide additional complementary actions to enhance our economic relations and achieve greater benefits for the American people. WIELDING STICKS --------------- 9.(C) Recent issues related to indigenous innovation, express delivery and on-line music content, for example, underscore that USG complaints about discriminatory policies - absent a credible threat of retaliatory action or other leverage -- are falling on increasingly deaf Chinese ears. China,s relatively strong economic position in the wake of the global financial crisis has intensified that trend. As has Chinese hubris that it can call the shots and determine the playbook under which it operates without disclosing the same to foreign firms. While WTO dispute settlement has worked well when applied, many of the problems we face in China,s market do not fall within WTO disciplines. We may want to consider ways to toughen up our talking points and enhance the use -- or perception of likely use -- of other real &quot;sticks&quot; in order to achieve market opening, job-creating objectives. This will require some consideration of just how much disruption in our economic relations we are willing to countenance if we must carry through on threats. -- HIGHLIGHT TO CHINESE POSSIBLE CONGRESSIONAL ACTION on hot-button issues like Renminbi valuation and carbon tariffs on Chinese imports. -- EMPHASIZE THAT CHINA,S INDUSTRIAL AND EXPORT-PROMOTION POLICIES WILL PROVOKE 421 CASES to be filed and positively considered. -- COORDINATE CHINA-DIRECTED TRADE AND ECONOMIC POLICY IN BILATERAL OR MULTILATERAL SETTINGS with the EU and other trading partners, especially in Southeast Asia, that face similar challenges with China. -- CONTINUE TO PURSUE AS APPROPRIATE WTO CASES, with emphasis on sectors most closely tied to U.S. jobs. Consider possibility of using lower &quot;probable victory&quot; standard in deciding whether to initiate such cases. FOCUS OUR ENGAGEMENT ON JOBS ----------------------------- 10.(C) Given current U.S. unemployment levels we suggest the interagency prioritize our objectives over the next year on those areas most likely to create jobs in the U.S. In particular, we suggest: -- AN OVERARCHING FOCUS ON OPENING CHINESE MARKETS TO EXPORTS OF U.S. SERVICES in all of the key U.S.-China bilateral economic fora in 2010, including the S&amp;ED and JCCT. For example, a strong push to eliminate joint venture requirements in select services sectors could be negotiated in exchange for a Chinese-sought concession. -- PRIORITIZE OUR &quot;ASKS&quot; OF CHINA ON GOODS SECTORS THAT HAVE HIGHEST JOB-CREATION POTENTIAL AND STRONG CHINESE GROWTH POTENTIAL, and intensify our advocacy in these areas through the methods outlined below. BANG FOR THE BUCK: INCREASE AND DIVERSIFY EXPORT PROMOTION --------------------------------------------- 11.(C) Since 2005, very conservative estimates show that BEIJING 00000231 004 OF 007 U.S. exports of goods to China created 285,000 jobs in the United States. In that same period, every dollar of funding for export promotion activities facilitated an average of USD 617 in exports to China. While many of the programs listed below would require either a shift in or new funding, those investments would quickly payoff. To increase U.S. exports to China in the near and medium term, it is essential that we expand and enhance existing export promotion programs, including: -- EXPAND SECTOR-SPECIFIC PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. For example, the highly successful Aviation Cooperation Program, or ACP, was founded with support from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA). It now has over 40 corporate members, sponsored training for over 100 Chinese aviation professionals, and has introduced U.S. firms and technology throughout China,s aviation industry and regulatory structure. USG participation has helped U.S. firms build relationships with local officials that are crucial to doing business here. Likewise, an Energy Cooperation Program was established in 2009 along these same lines and healthcare is a strong candidate for immediate consideration for a similar new partnership. -- OFFER SMEs INCENTIVES TO TEST NEW MARKETS HERE. Japan, Korea, and Germany offer SMEs loans or subsidies to offset costs of travel, trade show participation, market entry, and business matchmaking. They help companies develop procurement strategies to be more price competitive. Such measures are currently proscribed under the U.S. system. -- TELL THE STATES WE ARE READY TO HELP: Present at Annual Governor&apos;s Association meeting and other state venues on Mission services to help their states connect to counterparts in China. -- ESTABLISH FEDERAL AND/OR STATE-LEVEL INCUBATOR PROGRAMS, which help companies during market entry by Leveraging public-private partnerships to support new exporters. The German government partners with the German Chamber of Commerce in supporting the German Center Beijing. For start-up companies, the Center offers office space, conference facilities, in-depth counseling and practical advice from lawyers, accountants and market and sales professionals. In-house service providers assist German companies with a full range of services helping them compete. By developing public-private partnerships that join business expertise and government assistance, the USG could offer comparable one-stop service to U.S. companies to help level the playing field with competitors. -- DUPLICATE THE &quot;COOPERATOR&quot; PROGRAMS of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) in other sectors. FAS spends $25 million annually on cooperator programs in China to help companies create, expand and maintain long-term export markets for U.S. agricultural products. Those funds are matched by industry. TDA funds might help. -- FURTHER EXPAND FCS ACTIVITY IN CHINA, one of the most effective ways to spur export promotion. This will have a big bang for the buck in terms of across-the-board commercial outreach. -- FUND THE HIRING OF FCS EXPORT-PROMOTION CONTRACTORS IN THE 14 CHINESE SECOND-TIER CITIES that have been identified by Commerce as having the best U.S. export opportunities (these 14 cities, each of which has a population in excess of one million, currently receive 53% of all U.S. exports to China). -- CAPITALIZE ON CHINESE OUTWARD DIRECT INVESTMENT TO THIRD COUNTRIES. For example, the Embassy could organize match-making events to introduce U.S. upstream design and managerial services firms to Chinese design/build firms that BEIJING 00000231 005 OF 007 have contracts for infrastructure projects using PRC concessional loans in Asia, Africa and Latin America. -- SEEK TO REDUCE U.S. EXPORT CONTROLS ON SALES OF JOB-CREATING TECHNOLOGIES that are readily available from our allied competitors (semiconductors manufacturing equipment, microwave chambers, composite prepregs). We know that there is an ongoing discuss about export controls in the U.S. and well recognize the national security implications of how we view export controls. ENCOURAGE CHINESE INVESTMENT IN THE U.S. ---------------------------------------- 12.(C) Apart from misperceptions of an unwelcoming political Environment and periodic complaints that key high tech investments are denied routinely due to CFIUS concerns, Chinese companies view the U.S. economy as an attractive investment destination. Dispelling harmful myths and actively promoting direct Chinese investment would help us capture a larger share of China,s rapidly growing ODI levels (PRC ODI to the world roughly doubled from $27 billion in 2007 to $56 billion in 2008), which in turn would create more U.S. jobs. In this regard, the following steps should be considered: -- THE INTERNET. We should create many more Chinese language websites that are directed at key secondary and tertiary cities in China. The more we facilitate access to information about American business opportunities -- whether through a national database or enhanced state and local databases -- the better. We believe thinking local, start-ups and grassroots first is the preferable way to go in using the Internet -- ENHANCE THE ADMINISTRATION&apos;S INVEST IN AMERICA PROGRAM. Other countries have national promotion programs that work with Chinese companies to help them identify industry clusters or target locations based on their criteria. -- DIRECT FEDERAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT STATE INVESTMENT-SPONSORED BUYING OR INVESTMENT MISSIONS originating in China. -- ADD INVESTMENT PROMOTION TO THE AGENDA OF VISITING CABINET AND OTHER HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS (conduct roundtables with influential Chinese business leaders who could move substantial investment to the United States). -- CONDUCT A PUBLIC DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN to erase misperceptions about the scope of CFIUS restraints, including use of existing bilateral fora like the S&amp;ED, Investment Forum, and JCCT and &quot;investment missions&quot; to provincial capitals and second-tier cities. -- EXTEND THE VALIDITY OF U.S. B-1/B-2 visas for Chinese travelers. EXPANDING TOURISM AND EDUCATIONAL TRAVEL ---------------------------------------- 13.(C) A fundamental Chinese misperception that our doors are closed constrains growth in Chinese travel to the U.S. across a wide range of categories, as does the confusing diversity of state-level programs on tourism and education. A rich and sustained effort to overcome these factors could pay rapid and substantial job-creating dividends. We need to create a buzz in the street that travel to America for business for other reasons is actually pretty easy. And that traveling in America is generally easy and without restrictions. We propose the U.S. consider: -- ESTABLISH A CHINA-SPECIFIC TRAVEL AND TOURISM AUTHORITY. BEIJING 00000231 006 OF 007 A national body to encourage the rapidly growing pool of Chinese tourists to spend leisure time in the U.S. could accelerate growth in individual travel and boost group travel. Local U.S. tourism offices need help understanding what attracts Chinese visitors. -- DUPLICATE IN OTHER FIRST-TIER CHINESE CITIES THE NATIONAL TOURISM ASSOCIATION (NTA) program office that was created in DOC,s Shanghai Commercial Center (NTA received a supporting Market Cooperator Grant). -- INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF OUTREACH PROGRAMS to educate Chinese public on the visa process, including intense public diplomacy through media channels. The more visitors, the more money they will spend and we enhanced &quot;see America&quot; program will create good service sector related jobs in the travel and tourism industry. -- SEEK TO EXTEND VISA RECIPROCITY FROM ONE TO FIVE YEARS IN ALL VISA CATEGORIES. The Embassy has just negotiated the extension of visa reciprocity for select categories to five years. Expanding this to all visa categories would dramatically help promote U.S. openness to legitimate travel. (By contrast, U.S. visa reciprocity with Thailand is ten years.) -- EXPAND STATE,S EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS INITIATIVES to provide student advising and enhance student mobility between the U.S. and China as well as to support American universities, professional and technical training efforts to bring more Chinese adult students to the United States for training. It is notable that the number of Chinese in the United States for non-university education has nearly doubled in the last few years, demonstrating that U.S. education services are sought by Chinese and are an industry in which jobs could be created. -- EXPAND FEDERAL DIRECTION AND SUPPORT TO PROMOTE community and state college recruitment of Chinese graduate and undergraduate students. -- WORK TO CHANGE CHINESE PERCEPTIONS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF UNIVERSITY RANKINGS and promote enrollment in a broader range of U.S. institutions. DANGLING CARROTS ---------------- 14.(C) Where China is already seeking assistance from us or encouraging investment, we should capitalize on that interest for job promotion. For example: -- ADVERTISE MORE EFFECTIVELY FOREIGN-FRIENDLY INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN CHINA, especially those that are already with PRC encouragement and which are tied to follow-on U.S. goods exports (current examples include mining and logistics management). -- IDENTIFY AND REDUCE USG-CREATED BARRIERS TO GROWTH IN THOSE SECTORS WITH THE MOST POTENTIAL IN CHINA. Green technologies is the most potent example. U.S. subsidies to R&amp;D in green technologies, specifically solar panels, expire biannually. That unpredictability stymies long-term R&amp;D by U.S. companies in the field, a detriment to their competitiveness in the industry. Establishing a long-term program for R&amp;D would increase U.S. competitiveness. -- LEVERAGE CHINESE INTEREST IN TECHNICAL EXCHANGES WITH EPA, FDA AND OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES to extract specific commitments on expanded market opportunities for U.S.-based services in related fields, consistent with U.S. health and safety interests. BEIJING 00000231 007 OF 007 -- RE-EXAMINE EXPORT CONTROLS ON COMMERCIALLY-IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY being made available to China by allied competitors (i.e. semiconductor manufacturing equipment; aviation; EMC and microwave chambers).

Knight Frank&apos;s global house price index shows the weakest region in the three months to the end of September was Europe, posting 0.8% house price growth, while Asia-Pacific was the strongest with average growth of 9.9%. For the first time since late 2008, quarterly prices increased in each of the six world regions monitored by Knight Frank (Asia-Pacific by 9.9%, Middle East by 5.1%, North America by 4.2%, South America by 3.5%, Africa by 3% and Europe by 0.8%). But annual growth in Europe ranged from 26.1% in Latvia to -13.9% in Lithuania and -14.8% in Ireland, while average house prices in the US now stand at their mid-2003 level, according to the estate agent. It said the critical driver for weaker global performance was the number of countries &quot;tipping back into negative growth&quot; in the most recent quarter, with 14 (mainly European) countries notching house price falls. Liam Bailey, head of residential research at Knight Frank, said there is now a growing gap between the less debt-afflicted European economies of Austria, France and Finland and their neighbours to the south and west of the continent, with Greece, Spain and Ireland ranking much lower in its global house price index. &quot;While a majority of countries are reporting positive annual growth, 56% saw prices fall in the third quarter this year,&quot; Bailey said. &quot;There is growing evidence that the global housing market recovery, which began in early 2009 following the desperate conditions in 2007 and 2008, may just be beginning to run out of steam. &quot;Nearly a third of countries which had experienced strengthening conditions in [early] 2010 saw quarterly price growth turn negative in the third quarter of 2010.&quot; Led by European markets, the list of countries recording average house price falls includes Greece, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia and the UK. Outside of Europe the list includes China, Canada, Colombia, Dubai, New Zealand, South Africa and Taiwan. Expensive consumer locations However, despite the global slowdown in house price inflation, homeowners and consumers must cope with the rising costs of everyday goods, according to shopping website PriceRunner. It said the cost of such items have risen internationally over the past year. It said the cheapest city in the world is Mumbai, with prices 27% below the global average, followed by Bangkok and Dubai as the second and third cheapest, with prices 19.8% and 16.2% respectively below the world average. London slipped down the list of most expensive cities in the world, from second in 2007 to eighth this year, according to the group&apos;s international price comparison survey, which compares a range of products across 32 countries. Oslo was found to be the most expensive city for the fourth successive year. In the city a can of Coke will set consumers back \u00a31.80 (56p in UK), while a litre of milk costs \u00a31.56 (80p in UK) and fast-food fans must shell out \u00a34.70 for a Big Mac (\u00a32.39 in UK). Across the 32 countries the price of some everyday purchases decreased (such as a pint of milk falling from 86p to 81p, and a can of Coke dropping from 75p to 56p). Many items have increased dramatically including coffee (from \u00a31.63 to \u00a32.50), cinema tickets (from \u00a38.90 to \u00a39.62) and condoms (from \u00a36.63 to \u00a38.99). Marc Thomas, UK manager for PriceRunner, said: &quot;London is seen by many as an expensive holiday option, but if you&apos;re choosing to shop in Europe it is still relatively cheap. Many retailers are maintaining their low prices across tech and gadgets in a bid to kick-start the economy. &quot;Consumers should enjoy the lower prices now before the VAT increase kicks in at 20% in 2011. With many other EU countries also raising their VAT, next year&apos;s results should make for interesting reading.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/08/confucius-peace-prize-liu-xiaobo", "publicationDate": "2010-12-08T14:11:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Liu Xiaobo", "Nobel peace prize", "Norway", "World news", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The Confucius prize committee said it had chosen Lien Chan, a former Taiwan vice president and still a powerful figure within the Nationalist party, as the first winner.", "It said he had &quot;built a bridge of peace between the mainland and Taiwan&quot;."], "title": "Chinese peace prize seeks to rival Nobel", "article": "A Chinese group has launched its own peace award as a riposte to the Nobel peace prize following Beijing&apos;s fury at the decision to honour the jailed dissident Liu Xiaobo. The organisers will hand out a Confucius peace prize tomorrow \u2013 a day ahead of the Nobel ceremony in Oslo. They argue that China &quot;should have a greater voice on world peace&quot; because it has over 1 billion citizens, while Norway is small and the Norwegian committee &quot;could be inevitably biased and fallacious&quot;. Beijing has attacked the choice of Liu, a 54-year-old critic and writer, as an infringement of its sovereignty and an example of western ideological warfare. Liu is serving an 11-year prison sentence for incitement to subversion. He had co-authored Charter 08, a bold appeal for democratic reforms in China. Eighteen other countries have said they will not attend Friday&apos;s Nobel ceremony after China warned diplomats in Oslo not to attend and said there would be &quot;consequences&quot; if they did so. The Confucius peace prize, named after China&apos;s most influential philosopher, was created to &quot;interpret the viewpoints of peace of [the] Chinese [people],&quot; the awards committee said in a statement. The Chinese state media has yet to mention the award, and it is not clear to what extent it has official backing. The invitation to the award ceremony was apparently issued by a section of the culture ministry, but a publicity official there told Reuters: &quot;Everyone keeps calling to ask about this \u2026 we don&apos;t know.&quot; The group&apos;s chairman, Tan Changliu, acknowledged that the prize was not well-known, adding: &quot;It needs to grow gradually, and we hope people will believe the award is of global significance.&quot; Liu Zhiqin, the Chinese businessman who first proposed the idea in an opinion piece, argued that the Norwegian judges had &quot;[supported] a criminal while creating 1.3 billion &apos;dissidents&apos; that are dissatisfied with the Nobel committee&quot;. He added that China should teach westerners to &quot;kindly treat people that have different national values and lifestyles&quot;. Chinese citizens who have backed the award to Liu have experienced harassment, surveillance and detention. Many activists and dissidents have been prevented from travelling abroad to ensure they do not attend Friday&apos;s ceremony. The Confucius prize committee said it had chosen Lien Chan, a former Taiwan vice president and still a powerful figure within the Nationalist party, as the first winner. It said he had &quot;built a bridge of peace between the mainland and Taiwan&quot;. An employee in Lien&apos;s Taipei office said she could not comment because she knew nothing about the prize. Other nominees included Bill Gates, Nelson Mandela, Jimmy Carter, Mahmoud Abbas and the Panchen Lama. The lama \u2013 the second highest monk in Tibetan Buddhism \u2013 is a highly controversial figure because a six-year-old boy identified by the Dalai Lama was rejected by authorities and has not been seen since. Beijing announced that a search committee had selected another boy, who is now Panchen Lama. The Confucius prize includes a 100,000 yuan (\u00a39,500) award, while the Nobel peace prize winner receives 10m kronor (\u00a31m). &quot;The idea of the Confucius peace prize can only be described with one word \u2013 absurd,&quot; the Chinese rights lawyer Teng Biao said. &quot;Of course there are aspects of Chinese tradition that should be respected and carried on, and some Confucian ideas are valuable as well, but definitely not in this way. &quot;Peace is not measured by the population or space of a country. Saying Norway is a small country so it does not have much say on peace [or human rights] is just ridiculous \u2026 Norway is one of the most free and democratic countries in the world. Steve Tsang, a China scholar at Oxford University, said: &quot;The whole thing is too obviously being rushed to counter the Nobel prize to Liu Xiaobo. &quot;People will see it for what it is. That being the case, it&apos;s not going to be very credible.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/250144", "publicationDate": "2010-12-08T21:30:11Z", "tags": ["China", "Nigeria", "Oil", "US foreign policy", "Business", "World news", "The US embassy cables", "Africa", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["A third reason is to prove that Taiwan is not an issue."], "title": "US embassy cables: US monitors China and its expanding role in Africa", "article": "Tuesday, 23 February 2010, 08:20C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 LAGOS 000075 SIPDIS DEPARTMENT FOR AF/FO, AF/W, AF/RSA, AND INR/AA AMEMBASSY YAOUNDE PASS TO AMEMBASSY MALABO EO 12958 DECL: 2020/02/23 TAGS EPET, ENRG, ECON, PGOV, PREL, NI SUBJECT: ASSISTANT SECRETARY CARSON MEETS OIL COMPANIES IN LAGOS CLASSIFIED BY: Donna M. Blair, CG, State, ConGen Lagos; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) ------- SUMMARY ------- 1. (C) Assistant Secretary (A/S) Carson met with members of the International Oil Companies (IOCs) on February 7. The A/S stressed the fact that Nigeria is the most important country in Africa for the United States. The IOC members noted that the A/S spoke mainly of issues in Northern Nigeria and did not dwell on Southern issues. The Petroleum Industry Bill is discouraging future investment mostly in deep-water fields where most of the remaining oil in Nigeria lies. If Nigeria raised the price of gas to two-thirds of the world price, the IOC&apos;s would be at each others throats trying to cut the price by a penny or two. Nigeria has the possibility of becoming the next Pakistan within 25 years. A/S Carson allayed the IOCs concerns of the United States&apos; relationship with China. END SUMMARY. 2. (C) Assistant Secretary Carson met with members of the international oil community in Lagos on February 7. In attendance were the following: Shell Senior Vice President&apos;s Ann Pickard and Ian Craig; Shell Vice President Peter Robinson; Chevron Managing Director Andrew Fawthrop; Chevron Public Affairs Manager Femi Odumabo; Exxon Mobil Managing Director Mark Ward; Hercules Manager Coleman McDonough; Schlumberger Manager Supply Chain Service Demi Adenusi; American Business Council (ABC) President Dick Kramer; Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary; Economic Officer; Maritime Affairs Officer; Marine AttachC) and, Consul General Lagos. ----------------------------------------- NIGERIA: MOST IMPORTANT COUNTRY IN AFRICA ----------------------------------------- 3. (C) Fawthrop asked the A/S whether he was in Nigeria to deliver a message or was it more of a fact-finding trip? A/S Carson stated that he was in Nigeria for both reasons in that he wanted to listen and engage with Nigeria. Nigeria is the most important country in Africa for the United States due to: the size of its population; presence of hydro-carbons; peace keeping role in ECOWAS, especially in Sierra Leone and Liberia; its seat on the United Nations Security Council; along with the strength and size of its financial markets the A/S continued. Nigeria has enormous potential and is the seventh largest Muslim country in the world with an Islamic population that will eclipse Egypt by 2015 according to A/S Carson. Having no United States presence in Northern Nigeria is akin to having no presence in Egypt and is why the United States is considering opening a Consulate in Kano. 4. (C) The United States is concerned about the power vacuum in Nigeria and the state of health of President Yar A&apos;dua, per A/S Carson. The president is &quot;very, very, very, very ill&quot; and Nigerians are under illusions regarding the state of their president. &quot;Nigeria cannot afford to implode or run aground.&quot; 30 years of military government was not good. The United States expects a stable, legal, democratic, constitutionally-based government with no &quot;military involvement, full stop&quot; A/S Carson stated. It is important for the GON to do a better job this time around in regards to elections. Only ten percent of Nigerians saw a ballot ticket in the 2007 elections. If Nigeria brings credibility to its democratic processes, its economic processes will improve. LAGOS 00000075 002 OF 005 --------------------------------------------- ------------- UNITED STATES PRESENCE IN SOUTHERN NIGERIA NEEDS ATTENTION --------------------------------------------- ------------- 5. (C) Some places are more important than others within the Federal system of Nigeria and Lagos is one of the more important places, according to A/S Carson. Consulate General Lagos is bigger and more important than Embassies Benin and Togo together. Lagos is significantly more important than Cape Town even though the latter is 100 times better in terms of livability. The United States must be in Lagos in a significant way, A/S Carson declared. 6. (C) The statements of the A/S sounded wonderful from a Hausa viewpoint, but nothing was mentioned about Southern and Eastern Nigeria, Fawthrop pointed out. The A/S agreed that Fawthrop was correct. The United States is underrepresented diplomatically, economically, commercially, militarily and from a security standpoint. When the A/S served in Nigeria from 1969-1971, the United States had the Embassy in Lagos with Consulates in Ibadan, Kaduna, and briefly in Port Harcourt, before the Civil war, and also a USIS post in Kano. With the Nigerian population at 50 million the United States was better and more broadly represented in a Nigeria that produced almost no oil. With an Embassy in Abuja and a Consulate in Lagos, the United States has experienced a &quot;huge loss&quot; in Nigeria today, per A/S Carson. The United States must get back into Enugu and Port Harcourt. &quot;No presence means no access, which leads to no influence. Without influence you have nothing.&quot; 7. (C) Akwa Ibom governor Godswill Akpabio was singled out as an impressive governor by Mark Ward. Akpabio has built up infrastructure and industrial development. He is &quot;one to watch&quot; per Ward. Other Southern governors that were highlighted included were Rivers State governor Chibulke Amaechi and Edo State governor Oshiomhole. Fawthrop suggested that USAID has a lot to offer in the South in that if USAID makes a mistake it is OK. If a private company engages in a similar project and makes a mistake you have a FCPA investigation. The Consul General (CG) added that it might be possible to team up with security assets of the IOCs to arrange diplomatic trips to the Niger Delta. This arrangement would not happen &quot;100 percent of the time,&quot; but more often than not, per the CG. ------------------------------------- STATUS OF THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY BILL ------------------------------------- 8. (C) The PIB is more about taking control and not a real solution, per Mark Ward. XXXXXXXXXXXX There are currently three versions between the Senate, House, and Interagency committee and it is unclear when and what will materialize, according to Ward. Fawthrop added that the PIB amounts to resource nationalization and stated that it costs more than 40 percent to develop the oil as opposed to leaving it in the ground. The current fiscals of the PIB estimate that is costs 25 percent to develop the oil, thereby creating a disincentive. If the oil stays in the ground then billions of development money will go away and the resulting slowdown will be a massive problem. The IOCs received a lecture from a team made up of various GON agencies (the interagency team) in Abuja In a recent meeting in an example of the current level of communication per Fawthrop. The whole group then went to the office of the Vice President where the interagency team stated that there was very good communication between them and the IOCs. 9. (C) The large fields, elephants, have all been developed in LAGOS 00000075 003 OF 005 Nigeria per Fawthrop. What remains are fields one-quarter to one-third the size. The same costs are involved in producing the oil but the revenue will be less because there is less oil. The IOCs need more incentive, not less, in order to develop these fields profitably. What the PIB accomplishes is a disincentive. The downstream sector is very simple in Nigeria in that the refined gas is moved from one tanker to another, to a smaller tanker and then sold. The refining sector, exploration and production sectors are very complex. It is unrealistic for the PIB to try to change all of these areas in one tome of legislation, asserted Fawthrop. 10. (C) The gas side of the PIB tries to legislate the delivery of gas rather than incentivize it. &quot;The donkey is tired and beaten. It will not go no matter what you tell it&quot; stated Fawthrop. If the gas price went to two thirds of the world price the IOCs would &quot;cut each others throat&quot; to cut the price by one or two cents. The rest of the IOC members nodded in agreement to this statement by Fawthrop. European gas competition has gas developed on a cost plus basis adding about eight percent to the cost. The model should be based on rate of return and not forced upon operators by legislative decree. 11. (C) Whenever gas doubles the cost of electricity goes up by one quarter. Stable electricity will allow industry to flourish in Nigeria but this will not happen 15 months before the elections. Amateur technocrats run the oil and gas sector according to Shell&apos;s Peter Robinson. They believe that they can control the industry via spreadsheets and pushing through the PIB. There are many emotional issues in the PIB with Nigerian politicians believing that they make no money on deep-water projects. Potential banker and businessmen partners do not understand the industry. The GON has made USD 2.5 billion with no investment in the past two years according to Robinson. 12. (C) A large problem will be the ten percent of equity that is to go to the communities argued Fawthrop. Equity going into the communities will make them explode. The recipients of the monies will be highly disappointed when they see the amount they will receive, a much larger sum will be expected. Kramer referred to the community equity as the &quot;lawyer relief act&quot; and wondered how one defines an actual community. 13. (C) Peter Robinson stated after the meeting that Pedro Van Meurs, the oil consultant hired by the GON to help negotiate with the IOCs, is considering leaving. Van Meurs has been trying to show the GON officials that their fiscal math does not work with the PIB. Van Meurs does not agree with the IOC position completely but sees areas for improvement. One example given to Lagos Econoff by Exxon Mobil Project Manager Anh Tran concerned the levels of cost involved with deep-water projects. Exxon, and other IOCs, maintain that their capital costs are at least 40 percent of deep-water projects while the GON allows for 25 percent capital costs under the PIB. Van Meurs agreed that 25 percent was not adequate. -------------------------------- WHERE DOES NIGERIA GO FROM HERE? -------------------------------- 14. (C) It is possible that Nigeria could be a future Pakistan according to A/S Carson. In 25 years, there could be impoverished masses, a wealthy elite and radicalism in the North. The question is whether the oil wells will be dry as well and could Nigeria be on &quot;sustainable and irreversible glide path to a new economic base&quot; per the A/S. When you look at the 2020/20 plan by the GON you see that Nigeria needs to grow by 14 percent a year to LAGOS 00000075 004 OF 005 be at the current level of Indonesia Fawthrop asserted. That is using today&apos;s figures, which does not take into account Indonesia&apos;s growth Kramer added. Nigeria is growing at five percent now and would need 20 percent growth per annum in energy and USD 22 billion investment in power plants Fawthrop stated. What would happen if Nigeria fell just short of their goals, would there be an alternative plan in place Fawthrop wondered? He cited the example of the 2009 6,000 Megawatt goal. It was apparent early on that the goal was not feasible and an alternative plan could have been devised. The GON insisted that they would reach their goal and did not develop alternatives. The same would hold true for 2020/20 Fawthrop assumed. 15. (C) The A/S offered that a forum could be organized in Nigeria with World Bank President Robert Zoellick speaking to a wide audience. Under Secretary for Economic, Energy, and Agricultural Affairs Bob Hormats would be invited as well to lend his knowledge of Africa. The forum would be shaped with the broader picture in mind, not just oil. This would not be sponsored by the IOCs. Members of the business community and individuals that were committed to making oil meaningful to Nigeria&apos;s future would be asked to participate. Talk would center on &quot;over the horizon&quot; issues, where Nigeria has gone right and where it has gone wrong. Two or three fora would be defined with key people to spark debate. Religious tensions, North-South issues, the lack of capacity in the GON, narco-trafficking, the growing irrelevance of Nigeria, as Princeton Lyman has suggested, could be potential subjects. Nigeria is at a critical financial and political threshold and the entire nation could possibly tip backwards permanently, per A/S Carson. --------------------------------------- CHINESE - AMERICAN RELATIONS IN AFRICA --------------------------------------- 16. (C) What is the status of America&apos;s influence in Africa and how does it compare to China, Fawthrop queried? The influence of the United States has increased in Africa, the A/S countered. The United States&apos; reputation is stable and its popularity is the highest in Africa compared to anywhere else in the world. Obama has helped to increase that influence. &quot;We must manage the expectations of the Obama administration&quot; offered the A/S. The United States does not consider China a military, security or intelligence threat. China is a very aggressive and pernicious economic competitor with no morals. China is not in Africa for altruistic reasons. China is in Africa for China primarily. A secondary reason for China&apos;s presence is to secure votes in the United Nations from African countries. A third reason is to prove that Taiwan is not an issue. There are trip wires for the United States when it comes to China. Is China developing a blue water navy? Have they signed military base agreements? Are they training armies? Have they developed intelligence operations? Once these areas start developing then the United States will start worrying. The United States will continue to push democracy and capitalism while Chinese authoritarian capitalism is politically challenging. The Chinese are dealing with the Mugabe&apos;s and Bashir&apos;s of the world, which is a contrarian political model, A/S Carson stated. ------- COMMENT ------- 17. (C) A/S Carson effectively provided the IOCs with a rationale for the United States&apos; interest in Nigeria and its commitment to the country. This commitment seems more substantial than the IOCs given the prospect of the PIB and the current state of play in Nigeria. Providing the IOCs with statements of support through continuing if not increasing the USG presence in Nigeria will be important in determining the increasing, decreasing or non-existent role of the IOCs in the future in Nigeria. As the A/S stated, if we can have a substantial presence in Pakistan, why not Nigeria? END COMMENT. LAGOS 00000075 005 OF 005 18.

Liu Hui-fen was presented with a bag of 200 mutilated New Taiwan $1,000 notes that a businessman named only as Lin had inadvertently dropped into his company&apos;s industrial scrap machine. Each was torn into some 20 pieces. Liu, a 30-year-old forensic scientist, reassembled all the cash \u2013 amounting to $200,000 (\u00a34,000) \u2013 in seven days, a task she said had &quot;required patience&quot;. Confounded at first by the unwieldy pile of scraps, Liu soon found a way to attack the problem. She located the Chinese character guo \u2013 or country \u2013 on each bill and then worked outwards. When the job was finally completed, she said it was the most difficult she had ever accomplished, but added that she had enjoyed helping Lin out. Liu usually investigates handwriting samples but has a special brief to work on cases dealing with torn cash and has handled 247 in the past five years. &quot;I was so happy whenever I was able to put a piece into its right place,&quot; she said. The Justice Ministry in the Taiwanese capital, Taipei, has a special investigations unit that offers a free service repairing damaged cash.

The central bank determined that the shredded notes had been restored to its requirement for three-quarter completeness, and will return the cash to the lucky Lin.

Bell, Acting Economics Chief, US Department of State, Economics Section; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) Summary ------- 1. (C) We expect Serbia will continue to obstruct and undermine Kosovo&apos;s sovereignty in the lead up to and following the International Court of Justice&apos;s advisory opinion, which most believe will be ambiguous. Regardless of the position taken by the ICJ, Kosovo&apos;s independence and sovereignty are irrefutable. Serbia&apos;s government is unified in its refusal to accept that fact but is internally divided regarding how to push its claim to Kosovo after the ICJ issues its opinion in spring 2010. President Boris Tadic and his office appear willing to follow our and the EU&apos;s advice and to quietly accept any outcome while moving Serbia toward EU integration, but are lacking a coordinated plan to do so. In contrast, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic, driven by personal interest in self promotion and a misperception of the domestic political landscape, is planning a new diplomatic offensive on Kosovo on the heels of any ICJ opinion. Absent an alternative approach by Tadic, we expect Jeremic&apos;s more confrontational plan will win out. To temper Serbia&apos;s post ICJ strategy and to limit its duration and impact, we will need to be well coordinated with our EU allies and encourage the EU to wisely use its significant remaining carrots and sticks with Serbia to elicit the cooperative resolution of this issue, while assuring Kosovo&apos;s territorial integrity. We must also be prepared to fight Serbia in the UNGA if necessary. End Summary. Preparing for the Advisory Opinion ---------------------------------- 2. (C) Over the next several months as the ICJ deliberates, we expect Foreign Minister Jeremic to maintain an offensive posture and continue his globe spanning travels, heralding the upcoming ICJ decision at each stop. He will try to prevent any further recognitions of Kosovo during this interim period and to shore up support from Serbia&apos;s allies, particularly Russia, the EU non-recognizers (Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Slovakia and Spain) and members of the Non-Aligned Movement. Previewing his intentions, Serbian media reported on December 25 that Jeremic sent a letter to foreign ministers of countries which have not recognized Kosovo, expressing gratitude for upholding the UN Charter and the hope that they would continue to respect Serbia&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. In addition, Jeremic wrote that the ICJ opinion &quot;must not be obstructed in any way,&quot; suggesting that political meddling could influence the court&apos;s opinion. Absent direct intervention from President Tadic, we expect Jeremic will continue his quixotic global campaign with vigor. ICJ Opinion Likely to be Ambiguous ---------------------------------- 3. (C) The Serbian government expects the ICJ to deliver its opinion to the UN General Assembly by spring 2010. Media and analysts have speculated that the most likely scenario is for the ICJ to issue multiple opinions, with some supporting Kosovo and others Serbia. Kosovo Minister Goran Bogdanovic told local media on December 25 that he expected there would be significant political pressure to make the ICJ&apos;s decision &quot;more neutral.&quot; Serbia is thus preparing for an outcome that remains ambiguous, with both sides claiming victory. While the ruling&apos;s expected ambiguity could provide Serbia an opportunity to end its campaign against Kosovo, Foreign Minister Jeremic has already said Serbia will take no action that implies Serbia&apos;s recognition of Kosovo (reftel). 4. (C) Serbian politicians, including influential Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Rasim Ljajic, have told us that Serbia cannot merely forget Kosovo out of fear that the vocal and numerous opposition will accuse Tadic of treason. Ljajic pointed to the recent Progressive (SNS) victory in the Belgrade municipality of Vozdevac as a clear sign that the opposition has the potential to BELGRADE 00000003 002 OF 004 pose a real threat to the governing coalition. As a result, Serbian officials are now contemplating how vocal and obstructive the GoS should be after any final ICJ ruling in order to assure their political majority. Tadic&apos;s Unclear Path -------------------- 5. (C) Over the past month several European interlocutors have stressed with President Tadic the need to move beyond Kosovo and to focus on Serbia&apos;s European integration. We believe the message is beginning to sink in with Tadic, but he still lacks a coordinated strategy to implement. Tadic&apos;s National Security Advisor, Miki Rakic, told Charge Brush on December 10that the government still had no plan for its post-ICJ policy and was only then beginning to consider alternatives. In separate meetings with Charge Brush on December 28 and 29, Defense Minister Sutanovac and informal presidential advisor Srdjan Saper both seemed confused when Charge Brush asked about Tadic&apos;s post-ICJ strategy, with neither even willing to speculate on what the President might be thinking. 6. (C) EU sources in Belgrade confirm that during his December 15 meeting with Tadic EU Director General for Foreign Affairs Robert Cooper encouraged Serbia to think carefully about how it would handle Kosovo issues after the ICJ opinion. According to our EU sources, Tadic and his foreign policy advisor Jovan Ratkovic told Cooper that Serbia was currently analyzing four possible post ICJ scenarios, but had yet to &quot;draw any firm conclusions.&quot; Specifically Tadic mentioned consideration of the China-Taiwan model and the &quot;two Germanies&quot; scenario, recognizing that any outcome would need to be tailored to Kosovo&apos;s &quot;special situation.&quot; Tadic reportedly told Cooper that after the ICJ advisory opinion Belgrade would be more than ready to talk to Pristina -even directly- as long as talks were not perceived or portrayed as Serbia directly or indirectly recognizing Kosovo. Thoughts of Partition still in their Heads ------------------------------------------ 7. (C) Tadic reportedly told Cooper that he recognized that there needed to be a degree of clarity and finality to any outcome, cognizant that the EU would be unwilling to accept another &quot;Cyprus-like&quot; state as a member. Ratkovic more explicitly told Cooper that while Belgrade would need to accept that it would not govern Kosovo again, Kosovo would have to come to the realization that it would not effectively be able to extend its governance north of the Ibar river. Tadic reiterated to Cooper that ultimately Serbia&apos;s post ICJ strategy was being developed to avoid Serbia being a problem to its international partners but where its &quot;concerns were taken care of.&quot; 8. (C) Belgrade&apos;s Quint (U.S., UK, Germany, France, Italy) have frequently discussed the seriousness of Serbia&apos;s plans. Although listening to FM Jeremic would lead one to believe that the Minister actually has a plan for new status talks, neither he nor any other GoS official has ever publicly fleshed out Serbian goals, much less the details for any such talks. In a January 6 conversation with ChargC) Brush, Ratkovic would say only that &quot;Serbia did not send the Kosovo issue to the ICJ just to have it come back and blow everything up; we will use the ruling to increase regional stability.&quot; Jeremic&apos;s Preferred Path ------------------------ 9. (C) Despite claims from MFA Political Director Borko Stefanovic BELGRADE 00000003 003 OF 004 to Charge Brush on December 21 that the MFA was seeking &quot;a way out of its Kosovo strategy post ICJ&quot; we believe FM Jeremic intends to continue to beat the Kosovo drum throughout 2010. Jeremic is reportedly championing an alternative scenario under which the GoS would seek to &quot;legalize any ICJ opinion,&quot; as MFA State Secretary Stefanovic told Cooper on December 14. Serbia&apos;s goal could be to again use the UN to bolster the political legitimacy of its stance against Kosovo&apos;s independence. We expect the MFA envisions a multi-month process during which Serbia would try to persuade the UN General Assembly to adopt a resolution welcoming the ICJ ruling (or perhaps the portions favorable to Serbia&apos;s position) and calling for new negotiations as a result. If the UN effort is unsuccessful, the GoS might energize the NAM to issue a statement calling for new talks. 10. (C) Under Jeremic&apos;s scenario we expect Serbia would aim to reopen negotiations on Kosovo&apos;s status. The MFA would likely not seek direct talks with Pristina authorities but rather would insist upon a new, &quot;impartial&quot; international negotiator from a non-recognizing country. While Serbia&apos;s goal would be to reopen talks, it would not be in any hurry to conclude them and instead would try to drag out any talks for years. The ruling Democratic Party (DS) would likely want to postpone any result until after parliamentary elections scheduled at the latest for May 2012. EU&apos;s Carrots and Sticks ----------------------- 11. (C) While no EU state expects Serbia to recognize Kosovo, Serbia&apos;s EU path will remain muddled without recognizable and accepted borders between Serbia and Kosovo. The EU must lead the charge in making this clear to Serbia. The EU must be willing to offer Serbia carrots and sticks until there is a clearly accepted understanding of where Serbia ends and the Republic of Kosovo begins, while maintaining Kosovo&apos;s current territorial integrity. Levers at the EU&apos;s disposal include determining when to unblock the SAA with Serbia, the disbursement of IPA funds, and the speed with which the EU will consider Serbia&apos;s recently submitted application for EU candidacy. We also must be wary of EU states offering Serbia the wrong carrots. The UK Ambassador to Belgrade recently suggested to us that we should no longer push for additional countries to recognize Kosovo, in an effort to dissuade Jeremic from his own globe-trotting efforts to dissuade recognitions. U.S. Approach ------------ 12. (C) The arrival of the new U.S. Ambassador, coupled with two upcoming CODELS (Voinovich and Pomeroy), may provide the USG excellent opportunities to help President Tadic orient his rhetoric to European integration and the benefits thereof. During his December 15 meeting with Secretary Clinton, Jeremic invited her to visit Serbia in 2010. A visit in advance of the ICJ decision (the first since Powell visited in 2003 for PM Djindjic&apos;s funeral) would highlight USG support for Tadic&apos;s EU path and help steer him away from any pressure to consider new status negotiations. Comment ------- 13. (C) If Belgrade follows the path that President Tadic appears to favor, Serbia will be able to move forward with EU integration while still not recognizing Kosovo. If however, when the ICJ opinion is issued, Jeremic is the only one with a plan, the GOS is likely to pursue the misguided idea of continuing to battle in the UNGA. This course will at least delay and at worse threaten BELGRADE 00000003 004 OF 004 Serbia&apos;s EU aspirations. In either case, we must snuff out any further roundabout talk on partition by both President Tadic and Foreign Minister Jeremic. 14. (C) We must use the next few months before the ICJ issues its opinion to press Tadic to put the battle for Kosovo behind him once and for all and focus all of his government&apos;s energy on EU accession. The initial step is to encourage our EU Quint members to clearly state to Jeremic and Tadic that Serbia risks complicating its EU path if it continues to push for new status negotiations after an ICJ opinion. EU Quint members in Belgrade have told us they intend to meet with Jeremic soon to stress this specific point, pending guidance from their capitals. This message, however, will need to be reinforced directly by EU capitals and from Brussels. If our strategy is to be effective, we need to encourage Brussels to have a clear, coordinated policy regarding the linkage between Serbia&apos;s EU path and resolving practical issues with Kosovo. If Serbia fails to heed this message we and our like minded European partners will need to prepare to defeat any new Kosovo resolution in the UNGA next fall. This will require an aggressive strategy to counter Serbia&apos;s lobbying. 15. (C) Any strategy must include a coordinated statement from Washington and European capitals at the highest levels that Kosovo&apos;s partition is not an option and that continued defacto partition through Serbian interference will also put Serbia&apos;s EU membership on hold. This will require a coordinated effort with the European Union, which must be persuaded to use its leverage in tangible ways. A visit by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary to Belgrade before the ICJ ruling would help solidify this message both in Belgrade and in EU capitals. End Comment.

It&apos;s a significant day for those seeking greater freedoms in China, as well as, arguably, for the government in Beijing, which showed how economic muscle can have the tangible impact of scaring away ambassadors from the ceremony. Thanks again to Tania and Jon for their contributions.  1.54pm: I&apos;ve been chatting again to Jon Henley, who was inside Oslo&apos;s city hall throughout. He talks me through a simple, moving ceremony.  Note: to listen in full turn off the auto-refresh tool at the top of the page.  1.40pm: There&apos;s been a lively debate in the comments section on whether Julian Assange should get the nod next year. Well oddly enough, some people in Beijing (as well as Moscow) have been thinking the same thing, albeit perhaps out of mischief. On our Wikileaks live blog Matthew Weaver has posted this: The China Media Project reports  It was an editorial in Beijing Daily, the official Party mouthpiece of the Beijing city leadership, criticizing the Nobel Peace Prize as a &quot;tool of Western values and ideology,&quot; and snidely suggesting that this year&apos;s prize be given instead to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.  Here&apos;s part of its translation of what the paper said:  If we want to talk about someone who is now a figure in the global spotlight, then who, if not Julian Assange? The founder of the Wikileaks website has been the subject of a worldwide manhunt by Western nations led by the United States, and all because he wanted to release a number of secrets that could not be spoken. Based on what we know, Assange, who was arrested in London on December 7, will have to face a two-year jail term . . . Assange&apos;s misfortunes tell us that the freedom of speech that America advocates is not an absolute freedom, that it is a matter of kind and degree, and that it has its limits. Ordinarily, if you say vicious things about the American government, talk about its problems, or even openly critical the American government, this is nothing very remarkable. But this time Assange has dared expose the truth, airing out before the world a number of things and remarks that the American government wouldn&apos;t dare make public, make transparent or share with others \u2014 and this has stepped over the line of America&apos;s freedom of expression. And the worldwide manhunt [for Assange] is no surprise.   1.16pm: And that&apos;s the end of the ceremony. The commentary on the webcast explains that it usually concludes with Norway&apos;s king and queen, Harald and Sonja, congratulating the winner, something which clearly can&apos;t happen this time. That was an extremely moving even, and pitched very well: not a condemnation of China but a celebration of the life of one very brave man whose name and actions are now, thanks to the Nobel committee, known worldwide.  1.10pm: Ullman finishes, and the audience stands to applaud. If the emotional pitch wasn&apos;t already weepy enough we now get the children&apos;s choir of the Norwegian National Opera. Children&apos;s choirs are, we&apos;re told, a favourite of Liu, who sees them as a symbol of hope for the future. There won&apos;t be a dry eye in the house soon.  1.06pm: As Ullman reaches the section of Liu&apos;s speech in which he talks, extremely movingly, about his love for his wife, the camera pans to a young woman in the audience - either the US film actor Anne Hathaway or her doppelganger \u2013 wiping away a tear. It&apos;s very, very powerful stuff. You get the feeling this address will only become better known as the years pass.  12.48pm: And now we have Liv Ullman, reading Liu&apos;s increasingly famous &quot;I have no enemies&quot; court address. I reprinted some of this at 10.33am, and as I mentioned there, you can read a version of it here. Even if you&apos;ve seen the text previously, hearing it read out, slowly and gravely, by Ullman at the ceremony is very moving. Jagman likened Xiu to Nelson Mandela in his speech and the dissident&apos;s philosophy does sound similar at times:  I have no enemies, and no hatred.   12.41pm: As we hear some traditional Chinese music, followed by some Elgar, here&apos;s a brief summary of some of the other international reaction today. \u2022 Navi Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights  [I hope China will] come to recognise the positive contribution peaceful advocates like Liu Xiaobo can make to China&apos;s development... I want to say how dismayed I am by recent restrictions that China has placed on an ever widening circle of associates of Liu Xiaobo and activists and other critics.  \u2022 Noriyuki Shikata, a spokesman for the Japanese prime minister&apos;s office  We have always sent our ambassador to attend the Nobel Peace Prize. We of course think that it is a very important reward.  \u2022 India&apos;s Foreign Minister, S.M. Krishna  This is not a bilateral question... This is a function arranged by the Nobel foundation.  \u2022 Pakistan foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Basit  The politicisation of the Nobel Peace Prize for the purposes of interference in the domestic affairs of states is not only contrary to the recognised principles of inter-state conduct but also a negation of the underlying spirit conceived by the founder of the prize.  \u2022 Vietnam foreign ministry spokeswoman Nguyen Phuong Nga  We hope that the Nobel Peace Prize can be given to deserving organisations and individuals, and not be used for political goals.  \u2022 Taiwan&apos;s President Ma Ying-jeou   Concern for human rights does not distinguish between nationalities and borders  .  12.39pm: After another standing ovation Jagland announces that because neither Liu or any family members can attend today the Nobel citation and medal will be placed in an empty chair. He makes the short walk across the stage to the blue silk-upholstered seat, next to his own, and places the items down, without ceremony. Again, it is simple and straightforward but a hugely powerrful image.  12.35pm: Jagland ends his address with a rousing call to see Liu as a pointer to a better future for China, and takes a not-too subtle swipe at boycotting nations, referring to &quot;some political leaders focusing only on their short-term political interest&quot;. He ends:  [Liu&apos;s] views will, in the long run, strengthen China. We express to him and China our very best wishes for the years ahead.   12.30pm: I&apos;ve just had a chat with Tania, who has braved the cold the take in the scene outside Liu&apos;s former home near to central Beijing where, until recently, his wife, Liu Xia, was under house arrest. You&apos;ll hear that she suddenly breaks off the convesation \u2013 Tania called back to assure me that she hadn&apos;t been bundled into a police van but had to investigate some sudden police activity. Note: to listen in full turn off the auto-refresh tool at the top of the page.  12.16pm: The cereemony isn&apos;t going to make the Chinese government any more happy. Jagland says that Liu, from prison, told his wife he wants his prize &quot;dedicated to the lost souls of 4 June&quot;, that is those who died on Tiananmen Square in 1989. Jagland adds, to yet more applause:  It is indeed a pleasure for us to fulfill his wish.   12.11pm: Here&apos;s some more of the speech. Jagland is now discussing earlier occasions when winners were unable to attend, or governments were outraged. I should mention that I&apos;m taking the transcript from Reuters, rather than typing at huge speed:  There have been a number of previous occasions when the laureate has been prevented from attending. This has in fact been the case with several awards which have proved in the light of history to have been most significant and honourable... There was a great deal of trouble in 1935, when the committee gave the award to Carl von Ossietzky. Hitler was furious, and prohibited all Germans from accepting any Nobel Prize... Ossietzky did not come to Oslo, and died a little over a year later.There was considerable outrage in Moscow when Andrei Sakharov received his prize in 1975. He, too, was prevented from receiving the award in person. He sent his wife. The same thing happened to Lech Walesa in 1983. The Burmese authorities were furious when Aung San Suu Kyi received the Peace Prize in 1991. Once again, the laureate could not come to Oslo.In 2003, Shirin Ebadi received the Nobel Peace Prize. She came. Much could be said of the reaction of the Iranian authorities, but the Iranian ambassador did in fact attend the ceremony...The point of these awards has of course never been to offend anyone. The Nobel committee&apos;s intention has been to say something about the relationship between human rights, democracy and peace. And it has been important to remind the world that the rights so widely enjoyed today were fought for and won by persons who took great risks. They did so for others. That is why Liu Xiaobo deserves our support today.  Cue more applause. He continues:  Although none of the committee&apos;s members has ever met Liu, we feel that we know him. We have studied him closely over a long period of time.   12.07pm: The Norwegian Nobel committee chairman, Thorbjoern Jagland, has begun speaking:  We regret that the laureate is not present here today. He is in isolation in a prison in northeast China. Nor can the laureate&apos;s wife Liu Xia or his closest relatives be here with us. No medal or diploma will therefore be presented here today. This fact alone shows that the award was necessary and appropriate. We congratulate Liu Xiaobo with this year&apos;s peace prize.  The entire hall stands to applaud, for some minutes.  12.02pm: We begin with music: a pianist and (I think) a soprano with something from Grieg&apos;s Peer Gynt. To the side of the stage is a huge photograph of Liu Xiaobo. As the camera pans round you get a glimpse, on a slightly raised row of chairs to the right of the stage, one empty seat, near the end of the row. It&apos;s a hugely understated but very powerful image.  11.59am: The official website&apos;s live web coverage of the ceremony has just started, with commentary in English. Norway&apos;s king and queen have just pulled up in their limousine. Now comes a trumpet fanfare as they walk in to the city hall. It&apos;s regal stuff.      Tania Branigan Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    11.54am: Tania in Beijing has been rounding up restrictions on foreign media outlets in China ahead of the ceremony:  The Chinese government is strictly controlling access to unsanctioned information about Liu Xiaobo: the websites of the BBC, CNN and the Norwegian state broadcaster are currently blocked, for example. The authorities tend to control video and Chinese-language news much more strongly than information in English, which can be understood by far fewer people in China.Satellite feeds of the BBC and CNN \u2013 available mainly in hotels and housing compounds with large expat populations \u2013 are also cutting out when Liu or the Nobel is mentioned, several people report. I am also told that one state-owned hotel has simply pulled the plug on feeds of international news channels.Ever-inventive Chinese internet users began using the word &quot;empty chair&quot; on domestic microblogs to evade restrictions on discussions today \u2013 a reference to the seat that will be placed on the platform at the ceremony as a symbol of Liu and his family&apos;s inability to attend. Some references to that phrase appear to be being scrubbed by censors.Well-known blogger Wen Yunchao suggested on Twitter (blocked on the mainland but still used by those who can leap over the Great Firewall) that users should take a picture of an empty chair near them and post that instead.&quot;Everyone has an empty chair. It is at the award ceremony of Xiaobo&apos;s, it is by the dining table of [jailed activist] Zhao Lianhai&apos;s family. If we only watch, then one day it may appear by the dining table of your family as well,&quot; he wrote.       Tania Branigan Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    11.33am: Another update from Tania in Beijing.  Pu Zhiqiang, a well known rights lawyer based in Beijing, observes: &quot;If there is nobody accepting the award, it&apos;s going to be the shame and humiliation of the Communist Party, not the shame of the prize winner.&quot;He added: &quot;The government&apos;s sentence on Mr Liu was to scare him and us... The government knows it is losing its image and credibility so it fears its lies will be exposed to the public.&quot;Pu was detained for three days following the announcement of the prize, then put under surveillance for several weeks. &quot;Those people told me they will be with me from 9 to 11 December. Actually, right now, some people are with me,&quot; he said.   11.32am: Speaking of Twitter, this is from Channel 4 News&apos; Lindsey Hilsum, also in Oslo.  11.27am: If you&apos;re following the story on Twitter, it seems that the tag of choice has settled on #emptychair. Some users have even replaced their Twitter icon with a photo of said object.  I&apos;ve been speaking to the Guardian&apos;s Jon Henley, standing in the freezing cold outside Oslo&apos;s city hall as the various ambassadors&apos; cars pull up for the ceremony. He talks me through what will be happening. Note: to listen in full turn off the auto-refresh tool at the top of the page.      Tania Branigan Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    10.55am: More from Tania in Beijing:  A rare sign of dissent? Tibetan writer and blogger Woeser @degewa) has tweeted a picture of a banner congratulating Liu Xiaobo that she says was taken at Zhongnan University in Hunan province. The Guardian has been unable to verify that \u2013 it&apos;s not clear from the picture itself where or when it was taken. The sign is partially obscured in the picture but appears to read: &quot;[Liu Xiao]bo awarded 2010 Nobel peace prize... Chinese people&apos;s pursuit of democratic politics.&quot;   10.47am: So who will be there? The latest tally seems to be that of the 65 countries with embassies in Oslo, 46 have accepted invitations. In all, about 1,000 people will be in Oslo&apos;s city hall for the presentation of the award, worth about \u00a3900,000 to the winner, among them Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the US House of Representatives. It&apos;s worth at this point recalling the somewhat Orwell-esque language used by Beijing&apos;s foreign ministry spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, in re-stating China&apos;s position:  We hope those countries that have received the invitation can tell right from wrong, uphold justice.   10.42am: The foreign secretary, William Hague, has put out a statement to mark International Human Rights Day, including this:  We remember in particular Liu Xiaobo, who has been awarded the Nobel peace prize but is imprisoned in China, and we call again for his release.   10.33am: At today&apos;s ceremony, Liu will be officially represented by the Norwegian action Liv Ullman. She will read the statement Liu gave to the court during his subversion trial, on 23 December last year. The hugely eloquent, moving address has previously been reproduced on our Comment is Free site, but here&apos;s a taster:  I stand by the belief I expressed 20 years ago in my hunger strike declaration \u2013 I have no enemies, and no hatred. None of the police who monitored, arrested and interrogated me, the prosecutors who prosecuted me, or the judges who sentence me, are my enemies. While I&apos;m unable to accept your surveillance, arrest, prosecution or sentencing, I respect your professions and personalities. This includes the prosecution at present: I was aware of your respect and sincerity in your interrogation of me on 3 December. For hatred is corrosive of a person&apos;s wisdom and conscience; the mentality of enmity can poison a nation&apos;s spirit, instigate brutal life and death struggles, destroy a society&apos;s tolerance and humanity, and block a nation&apos;s progress to freedom and democracy. I hope therefore to be able to transcend my personal vicissitudes in understanding the development of the state and changes in society, to counter the hostility of the regime with the best of intentions, and defuse hate with love. I firmly believe that China&apos;s political progress will never stop, and I&apos;m full of optimistic expectations of freedom coming to China in the future, because no force can block the human desire for freedom. China will eventually become a country of the rule of law in which human rights are supreme. I&apos;m also looking forward to such progress being reflected in the trial of this case, and look forward to the full court&apos;s just verdict \u2013 one that can stand the test of history. Ask me what has been my most fortunate experience of the past two decades, and I&apos;d say it was gaining the selfless love of my wife, Liu Xia. She cannot be present in the courtroom today, but I still want to tell you, my sweetheart, that I&apos;m confident that your love for me will be as always. Over the years, in my non-free life, our love has contained bitterness imposed by the external environment, but is boundless in afterthought. I am sentenced to a visible prison while you are waiting in an invisible one. Your love is sunlight that transcends prison walls and bars, stroking every inch of my skin, warming my every cell, letting me maintain my inner calm, magnanimous and bright, so that every minute in prison is full of meaning. But my love for you is full of guilt and regret, sometimes heavy enough to hobble my steps. I am a hard stone in the wilderness, putting up with the pummeling of raging storms, and too cold for anyone to dare touch. But my love is hard, sharp, and can penetrate any obstacles. Even if I am crushed into powder, I will embrace you with the ashes.   10.05am: Tania Branigan has been looking over the reaction to today&apos;s prize in China&apos;s domestic media. You won&apos;t be surprised to know that it&apos;s angry:     Tania Branigan Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    One piece, in the popular nationalist tabloid the Global Times, is headlined: &quot;Today&apos;s Oslo \u2013 a centre of an evil cult&quot;.It adds: &quot;A farce that puts China on trial is underway in Oslo\u2026 A Chinese criminal named Liu Xiaobo is being honored today at a grand award ceremony\u2026It&apos;s unimaginable that such a farce, the like of which is more commonly seen in cults, is being staged on the civilized continent of Europe.&quot; The English version can be read here. Another commentary in the People&apos;s Daily \u2013 the official Communist Party newspaper \u2013 argues: &quot;The Nobel peace prize has clearly become a tool of western political forces... A few westerners\u2026[wish] to destroy China&apos;s development; this is clearly an insult to democracy.&quot; On the China Radio International site, an article warns: &quot;The Nobel peace prize\u2026 is attacking China now; tomorrow it may be attacking other developing countries and non-western countries.&quot;  9.52am: Time for a bit of background: \u2022 Tania Branigan recounts Liu&apos;s background, and his formative moments during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.\u2022 A brief film by Tania and Dan Chung on the background to today&apos;s prize.\u2022 A roundup of the crackdown on foreign news websites in China ahead of the ceremony.\u2022 From midday UK time you can watch a live webcast of the ceremony on the Nobel website.\u2022 A BBC backgrounder on other occasions when Nobel peace laureates have been unable to collect the prize in person.

That pressure is intensifying, say campaigners.The China Human Rights Defenders network reports that many more people have been taken away overnight. They include Zhang Zuhua, a co-drafter of Charter 08; he was previously under a form of house arrest, but CHRD says he was abducted on the street by security officers last night.A well-known human rights lawyer, Teng Biao, tweeted last night: &quot;The police got me just after I had given four classes in uni. They told me that I need to be watched in Yanqing [a county in surburban Beijing], from now until the 12th. They were very civilized this time, no black hood or anything.&quot; Others have had internet access cut off or their mobile phone service restricted.This time the crackdown focuses more on dissidents and activist, whereas previous drives \u2013 such as that before the Olympics \u2013 also attempted to remove petitioners, people seeking to bring grievances about local officials to central authorities.That may be why a small group of petitioners were able to (very briefly) protest outside United Nations offices in Beijing this morning, according to ITV correspondent @anguswalkeritv. He says they were soon driven away in a coach. The gathering seemed to be focusing on Human Rights Day rather than Liu. Rumours of protestors outside the Norwegian embassy appear to be untrue, however. The rumours did not specify whether the gathering was of people opposing or supporting the award to Liu.  9.43am: Before we go on any further, a brief news update: one of the countries which had agreed to boycott the ceremony under Chinese pressure, Serbia, has this morning reversed its decision. AP writes:  Serbia has reversed its decision to boycott the Nobel peace prize ceremony honoring imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo after facing sharp criticism from the EU and human rights activists at home.The government said Friday it is sending Ombudsman Sasa Jankovic to the ceremony &quot;in response to the expectations&quot; of the Serbian public.   9.26am: In Oslo today, for the first time in 74 years, the Nobel peace prize will be not be actually be handed to anyone during the annual awards ceremony. There will instead be an empty chair in the city hall in place of the recipient, the Chinese writer and pro-democracy activist Liu Xiaobo.  Liu is serving 11-year jail term sentence on subversion charges. Some previous peace prizes have been collected by family members \u2013 Andrei Sakharov&apos;s wife attended the 1975 ceremony. To prevent this, China has placed supporters of Liu, including his wife, Liu Xia, under house arrest. China&apos;s government, perhaps even by its standards, has been bullish in the face of international criticism, arm-twisting another 18 countries to boycott today&apos;s event, among them Russia and Pakistan. It has also launched one of the most severe crackdowns in years on other dissidents, placing an unknown number under house arrest or cutting off their communications, and preventing others from travelling. The ceremony takes place at 1pm Oslo time, midday in the UK. I&apos;ll be getting contributions from Tania Branigan in Beijing and John Henley in Oslo.

His greatest contribution to political life in Taiwan was during the 1970s and 80s, when he occupied key positions in the ruling nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) party, and in the reformist government under Lee&apos;s great political mentor, President Chiang Ching-kuo, son of Chiang Kai-shek. Lee was born on the mainland, in Hubei province, central China, and was educated at Fudan University in Shanghai, where he studied law, and then, in the late 1940s, at Columbia University, New York. On the defeat of the nationalists by the communists in 1949, he moved to Taiwan island, where the Republic of China continued in power. The mass movement of so many mainlanders to Taiwan, while it ensured the survival of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, came at a high price for the native Taiwanese, whose initial opposition to such a huge inward migration was met with brutal suppression. In his early career in the KMT government, Lee served as head of the China Youth Corps and Chair of the National Youth Commission. Later, he was the first president of the National Sun Yat-Sen University. It was only in the 1970s that Chiang, elevated to be president three years before his father&apos;s death, realised that Taiwan&apos;s loss of its seat at the UN in 1971 to the People&apos;s Republic of China, and its international isolation, meant that its political structures needed to be strengthened. Lee articulated these new objectives, in a speech for which he was criticised by hardliners in the KMT, as pushing for democracy and promoting freedom of the press. Over the next two decades, these aims would be achieved. As director general of the Organisation Department, in charge of key personnel appointments in the KMT (1972-77), Lee oversaw a large influx of native Taiwanese into prominent party positions, in a quest to increase its legitimacy to a population who still regarded the KMT as a political organisation for outsiders. Some of those he helped in their early career, such as Lien Chen, were to enjoy distinguished careers \u2013 Lien stood in the presidential election against Chen Shui-bian in 2004, and now serves as the emeritus president of the KMT. A riot against accusations of vote-rigging in Chung-li city in 1977, for which he took responsibility, ended this period of Lee&apos;s career. He returned in 1984 as minister of education during the critical final phase of Chiang&apos;s period as president, when some of the most significant moves were made towards creating a full democracy and allowing the lifting of martial law and organisation of genuinely independent . Lee lifted a number of restrictions on the activities of students, and was part of the group that supported Taiwan-born Lee Teng-hui when he became president after Chiang&apos;s death in 1988. His reward for this was to be appointed premier, and head of government, for a year until 1990. Disagreements with Lee Teng-hui led to Lee&apos;s departure from office. During the next two decades, he maintained a low profile as a more conservative member of the KMT. Taiwan progressed towards democracy far more quickly than many expected, holding its first genuinely competitive elections in 1996, and seeing the transfer of power from the KMT to the Democratic Progressive party (DPP) in 2000 and 2004. Power returned to the KMT in 2008. Lee is survived by four children. Two of them, Diane Lee and Lee Ching-hua, are legislators and public figures in Taiwan.  \u2022 Lee Huan, politician, born 24 September 1917; died 2 December 2010"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/14/richard-holbrooke-obituary", "publicationDate": "2010-12-14T01:39:00Z", "tags": ["Richard Holbrooke", "US news", "Bosnia-Herzegovina", "Serbia", "Afghanistan", "World news", "Europe"], "sentences": ["He was charged by critics with protecting the Indonesian president, Suharto, from criticism by American human rights advocates over East Timor, but his most important work lay in completing the shift in American diplomatic relations from Taiwan to the People&apos;s Republic of China, formally recognised by the US from the start of 1979."], "title": "Richard Holbrooke obituary", "article": "Richard Holbrooke, who has died aged 69 after suffering a ruptured aorta, was not the most universally beloved, but was certainly one of the ablest, the most admired and the most effective of American diplomats. He is one of the few of that profession in the past 40 years who can be compared with the giants of the &quot;founding generation&quot; of American hegemony, such as Dean Acheson and George Kennan.  Holbrooke was tough as well as exceptionally bright. He was a loyal, liberal Democrat, but also a patriot who was prepared to be ruthless in what he saw as his nation&apos;s interest. To his friends, he was kind and charming, but he could be abrasive: no doubt that characteristic helped prevent him becoming secretary of state on two occasions, under Bill Clinton and again when Barack Obama became president.  He held almost every other important job in the international service of the US. He was ambassador to the United Nations, where he dealt with the vexed problem of America&apos;s debts to the organisation, and to Germany. He was the only person in history to be assistant secretary of state \u2013 the key level in routine diplomacy \u2013 in two regions of the world, Europe and Asia. He distinguished himself as an investment banker, a magazine editor, a charity executive and an author, but he will be remembered most of all for his success in negotiating an end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina at an Ohio airbase, and for his part in the American intervention in Kosovo. At the time of his death, he was Obama&apos;s special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Richard Charles Albert Holbrooke, generally known as Dick, was born in Manhattan. Though his parents were ethnic Jews, they had little sense of Jewish identity, and were atheists. His father, Dan, had been born in Warsaw of Russian-Jewish parents and in the 1930s came to the US, where he was a successful medical doctor. Dick&apos;s mother was the former Trudi Moos, a potter. She had first gone to Argentina as a refugee from Germany before moving to the US. Dick was educated at Scarsdale high school, in New York&apos;s affluent Westchester county suburb, one of the most academically successful secondary schools in the US. His best friend there was David Rusk, son of Dean Rusk, later secretary of state to Presidents John F Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. Dick&apos;s own father died when he was 15, and he went on to Brown University, the Ivy League college in Rhode Island. Graduating in 1962, he was influenced by Kennedy&apos;s call to young Americans to serve the nation. Holbrooke joined the foreign service, and in 1963 was sent as a civilian official to Vietnam, where he was one of a talented cohort of young men who were to become leaders in American diplomacy, including John Negroponte, George W Bush&apos;s ambassador to Iraq and deputy secretary of state; Les Aspin, a future congressman and secretary of defence; and Anthony Lake, who became Clinton&apos;s national security adviser. Holbrooke worked for the infamous Robert Komer, who earned the sobriquet &quot;Blowtorch Bob&quot; for his work in the Phoenix &quot;strategic hamlets&quot; programme of forced resettlement.  Once back in Washington in 1966, Holbrooke worked for two years in the White House under Johnson, and then at the state department, where he was a junior member of the delegation to the fruitless initial peace talks with North Vietnam in Paris. He also wrote one volume of the famous Pentagon Papers, the government&apos;s secret history of its involvement in Vietnam, subsequently leaked to the New York Times and the Washington Post by Daniel Ellsberg. In 1970, probably aware that his Vietnam service might not be universally admired, Holbrooke asked to be sent to Morocco as director of the Peace Corps there. By 1972, Holbrooke was ready for a change. He became the first editor of the magazine Foreign Policy, created as a less stuffy competitor to the august Foreign Affairs. He also worked for Newsweek magazine. In 1976, he went to work for Governor Jimmy Carter of Georgia, who was beginning his campaign for president and badly needed some foreign policy expertise.  When Carter became president, in 1977, Holbrooke became his assistant secretary of state for Asian affairs. He was charged by critics with protecting the Indonesian president, Suharto, from criticism by American human rights advocates over East Timor, but his most important work lay in completing the shift in American diplomatic relations from Taiwan to the People&apos;s Republic of China, formally recognised by the US from the start of 1979. After the Republican Ronald Reagan became president in 1981, Holbrooke went to Wall Street. He became a consultant to, and later managing director of, the investment banker Lehman Brothers. At the same time he took on a good deal of pro bono work for the Carnegie Commission and other foundations interested in foreign policy. When Clinton became president in 1993, he appointed Holbrooke as his ambassador to Germany, where he initiated the important German-American institution, the American Academy in Berlin. After a year in Berlin, he was brought back to Washington as assistant secretary of state for European affairs, and became passionately committed to the search for peace in the former Yugoslavia. He achieved a close relationship with the Serbian president, Slobodan Milo\u0161evic as well as with the equally intransigent Croatian leader, Franjo Tudman. He invited them and the Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic to an isolated airbase near Dayton, Ohio, where in a brilliant display of &quot;parallel diplomacy&quot;, negotiating separately with all parties, he achieved the accords that ended the fighting in Bosnia by devising a federal structure to accommodate Bosnian Serbs on the one hand, and Croatians and Muslims on the other. In order to do so he was willing to threaten Milo\u0161evic that the US would bomb his headquarters. He maintained that the Serbs had experienced nothing but military success, and would not come to the table unless they feared American military power.  With the concluding of the Dayton Peace Agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina in November 1995, Holbrooke then announced that he had to go and get married. This was the third such occasion, his marriages to Larrine Sullivan, a lawyer, and Blythe Babyak, a television producer, having ended in divorce. His new bride was the television journalist Kati Marton, daughter of the Associated Press&apos;s White House correspondent, Endre Marton, and previously the wife of the television anchor Peter Jennings. Marton had been brought up as a Roman Catholic, but discovered that her grandparents were Jews and had died in Auschwitz.  Holbrooke resigned from government because he wanted to move back to New York with Kati, and went to work for Credit Suisse First Boston. The bank allowed him to act as President Clinton&apos;s representative, first to Cyprus in 1997, and later to Kosovo, where atrocities had been committed by Serbs on the Albanian majority. Extremely tough discussions followed, and when it proved impossible to reach agreement he lobbied within government for air strikes on Serbia. To give Milo\u0161evic a last chance of a negotiated settlement, he went to Belgrade for talks in the presidential palace. But no breakthrough was forthcoming, and so shortly afterwards Nato began the bombing campaign of March-June 1999 that resulted in Serbia&apos;s capitulation.  The following August, Holbrooke returned to public service as US ambassador to the UN. It had taken more than a year for his appointment to be confirmed, in part because he was accused of lobbying for Credit Suisse First Boston when engaged on government business. However, once he had been sworn in, he negotiated a crucial deal with the 188 other member nations. The US would pay its $900m debt, accumulated since President Reagan&apos;s attack on the UN, and in return dues were redistributed so that the US share was reduced. After the Republicans won the 2000 presidential election and George W Bush became president, Holbrooke went back once again to the private sector, becoming a director of Human Genome Sciences, Inc. He also founded and remained president of the Global Business Coalition on HIV/Aids, whose activity was subsequently extended to deal with tuberculosis and malaria: it was an extremely effective NGO linking such powerful corporations as Coca-Cola, L&apos;Or\u00e9al, Chevron and many more. In 2009, President Obama made Hillary Clinton, whom Holbrooke had supported in her presidential campaign, secretary of state, while Holbrooke became his envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan; she acknowledged her friend&apos;s &quot;ability to shoulder the most vexing and difficult challenges&quot;.  Holbrooke&apos;s incandescent confrontations with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, became legendary. On 21 August 2009, Holbrooke accused Karzai to his face of having rigged the Afghan elections. Though officials denied details of the showdown, it is clear that Holbrooke&apos;s relation with Karzai broke down totally in a shouting match.  Subsequently his influence waned. He was deeply committed to improving relations with Pakistan, which he saw as the key to the Afghan situation. But when floods devastated Pakistan last July, he insisted that relief must come as the first priority, ahead of putting pressure on the Pakistan government to do more to root out jihadis from its tribal area, the policy issue on which he had put maximum pressure before the humanitarian issue arose.  Last Friday, at a meeting with secretary of state Clinton, he fell ill. After he arrived at George Washington University hospital, Washington, he underwent prolonged surgery, and remained in a critical condition till his death.  He is survived by Kati, his two sons, David and Anthony, from his first marriage, and his brother, Andrew. \u2022 Richard Charles Albert Holbrooke, diplomat and businessman, born 24 April 1941; died 13 December 2010"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/dec/14/maths-post-16-uk-poor-performance", "publicationDate": "2010-12-14T07:32:59Z", "tags": ["Mathematics", "Schools", "Education"], "sentences": ["In Japan, some 85% take advanced maths, equivalent to at least AS-level, in upper secondary; in Taiwan, the figure is 70%; in South Korea, it is 57%; and in New Zealand, 41%."], "title": "Students taking maths post-16: Japan 85%, UK 14%", "article": "The United Kingdom has a problem, it seems, when it comes to maths education. Results from an international testing study last week triggered a fresh round of soul-searching after they revealed that the UK is falling down the global rankings for reading, science and particularly maths. And, today, new research revealed exclusively in Education Guardian shows England, Wales and Northern Ireland finishing bottom of another kind of league table, which compares countries according to the number of young people persisting with any kind of maths education beyond the age of 16. The study, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, shows that among 24 states, these three &quot;home&quot; nations are the only ones where fewer than 20% of pupils take mathematics in any form during what the researchers classify as the &quot;upper secondary&quot; years. Scotland is one of three other countries where the figures stand in the 20-50% range. The remaining 18 countries all have post-16 participation rates for maths of more than 50%, the paper reports, with rates running at more than 95% in eight of them, including Sweden, Finland, Japan and Korea. &quot;The findings are stark,&quot; says the paper. &quot;By any standards, we are out on a limb.&quot; Not all students who take maths post-16 in other countries are studying advanced mathematics along the lines of A-levels. However, even when only pupils taking maths to advanced level are compared, the UK is still towards the bottom of the class, the research reveals. In Japan, some 85% take advanced maths, equivalent to at least AS-level, in upper secondary; in Taiwan, the figure is 70%; in South Korea, it is 57%; and in New Zealand, 41%. By contrast, advanced maths take-up in the UK ranges from 11% in Wales through 13% in England to 15% in Northern Ireland and 23% in Scotland, with a UK average of between 13% and 14%. Is this a problem? And if so, how should it be tackled? Among those calling for urgent action have been the CBI, the business lobby group, which published a paper in August recommending that all young people continue with some form of maths or numeracy education post-16, whether they were on an academic track or training in the workplace. Young people leaving school with poor maths skills are costing the economy \u00a32.4bn a year, the CBI said, and without an &quot;uplift&quot; in mathematics and numeracy capabilities, the UK would find itself falling behind in fields such as environmental technology, pharmaceuticals and the creative industries. Marcus du Sautoy, professor for the public understanding of science at Oxford University, says: &quot;It&apos;s absolutely fundamental that we do increase these numbers. Other countries recognise the central importance of mathematics as part of education and that it must not just stop at age 16. It is the foundation of the whole of science and technological understanding, and we need more maths people. Banks, for example, are crying out for people with mathematical ability.&quot; The situation in this country is not entirely bleak, with numbers taking A-level actually growing substantially in recent years, after problematic changes to the course prompted an exodus from the subject in 2001. However, the Nuffield paper argues that A-level maths is still attracting a lower proportion of students than it did in the mid-1990s. Jeremy Hodgen, of King&apos;s College, London, who led the research, says that many people who need to be proficient with numerical concepts, such as future primary teachers and nurses, are missing out in the UK by dropping the subject at 16. He says: &quot;Few primary teachers will have done any maths between the age of 16 and their early- to mid-20s, when they take a post graduate certificate in education. That is serious.&quot; An obvious solution would appear to be simply to make the subject compulsory after the age of 16. After all, as the study points out, eight countries require all pupils, whether in academic or vocational education, to persevere with it. However, attempts to curtail post-16 freedom of subject choice, or even to promote greater breadth of study, have foundered in this country in the past. In 2000, reforms to the A-level which introduced today&apos;s AS exams, taken after a year of sixth-form study, were meant to encourage students to take a broader range of subjects, with those who favoured art taking maths or a science at least to AS, and vice versa. But the reform largely failed in this aim. Alan Smithers, director of the centre for education and employment research at Buckingham University, believes compulsion will not work. He says: &quot;I think it&apos;s probably better that, when they get to upper secondary, young people are choosing for themselves. The main problem here is that we do not have the clear pathways that other countries have, where maths is integral to the qualifications that people want to take, whatever they want to do in the future.&quot; In Germany, for example, young people have to study academic maths to gain the Abitur, the school-leaving qualification for pupils in grammar schools, but also in apprenticeship courses. Given that compulsion would be tricky here, the Nuffield paper suggests other ideas. Hodgen says we should look to New Zealand, where the number of students taking some form of advanced maths is more than treble the figure for England. New Zealand offers a more attractive range of mathematical options to them, says Dr Hodgen, including a &quot;modern statistics&quot; choice which might win more followers here than the &quot;really traditional&quot; approach to statistics of A-levels. His paper advocates a government review and also the introduction of a maths course which could be pitched at those who gain C and B grades at maths GCSE, who tend now not to opt for A-level. This is in line with ideas set out in another paper over the summer, by the Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education(Acme), which acts as a bridge between maths teachers and the government. It advocated a new set of maths &quot;pathways&quot; at post-16 level, to tackle what it said was an inadequate range of options for students not committed to A-levels. Another idea put forward in Acme&apos;s paper seems to be winning favour. It has a familiar ring. The government could introduce a new &quot;baccalaureate&quot;, rewarding students for post-16 study in maths, English and four other subjects. With the coalition already introducing a GCSE-equivalent English baccalaureate, recognising success in five academic subjects, a debate around a post-16 version may be coming. In any case, expect pressure for ministers to start looking at this subject in detail to continue. www.nuffieldfoundation.org"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/dec/14/cribsheet-primary-school-league-tables", "publicationDate": "2010-12-14T12:42:26Z", "tags": ["Education", "Primary school league tables", "Primary schools"], "sentences": ["Compared with Japan, Taiwan and New Zealand, we&apos;re doing badly."], "title": "Cribsheet 14.12.10", "article": "Primary school league tables are out It&apos;s that time of year again ... they&apos;re making a list, and checking it twice; gonna find out who&apos;s naughty and nice \u2013 yes the primary school key stage 2 league tables have been published today.

It emerged yesterday that the pupil premium won by Lib Dems will not make schools better off because of changes to the inflation forecast and ministers conceded that school budgets will not rise in real terms over the next four years. Meanwhile, pre-school learning is also under the spotlight as a study reveals that children&apos;s early language and numeracy has improved little despite initiatives, such as Sure Start, aimed at boosting pre-school educational achievement. A team from Durham University&apos;s Centre for Evaluation and Monitoring found that basic levels of development in early reading, vocabulary and maths remained largely unchanged between 2001 and 2008. More education stories from the Guardian With the focus is still on the student protests, we talk to NUS president Aaron Porter about the battle against tuition fee rises. &quot;This is not the end of the fight, but the beginning,&quot; he says. He also reveals, while talking to Janet Murray, that he intends to stand for NUS president for a second term. Student support for the Lib Dems that was strong is quickly waning, writes Murray:  As far as Porter is concerned, some Lib Dems have been &quot;dazzled by the ministerial car and the big office&quot;. Nick Clegg is &quot;more interested in maintaining his position as deputy prime minister&quot; than social justice.

Although, as is often the case on these occasions, the actual fighting was just a bit disappointing. We asked former world super-middleweight champion Joe Calzaghe for his opinion of the Italian brawl and four other recent dust-ups \u2013 and he was largely unimpressed with the technique on show. Italy, December 2010. Berlusconi supporters brawl with members of the breakaway party formed by his former ally Gianfranco FiniMy advice would be do less talking and more fighting. They should be looking to be first to the punch. Just walk up and give them a slap on the chops when they&apos;re not expecting it. Then maybe work to the body, get some upper cuts in. You need to use speed in the confined space of a crowded parliament building. Argentina, November 2010. Graciela Cama\u00f1o slaps colleague Carlos Kunkel You can see the menace in her eyes as she&apos;s building up to it. It&apos;s a lovely shot with really good accuracy right on the bridge of the nose. What she does well is move out quickly once she&apos;s got the punch away. She might have got a bit more power \u2013 it was more a slap \u2013 but these are hit-and-run tactics and she got her shot off well. I enjoyed that. Ukraine, April 2010. MPs throw eggs and grapple during a debate over the Russian naval presence in Crimea. I can&apos;t imagine this happening in the UK. You&apos;d be taken down by Special Branch as soon as you got your eggs out. I was disappointed to see them holding on so much, but they fight a bit like the Klitschkos [Vladimir and Vitally, Ukrainian world champions]. There is only really one clean punch in there. It&apos;s an overhand, clubbing shot. A little bit sneaky, but sometimes it&apos;s got to be done. Taiwan, July 2010. MPs fight over a trade pact with China There&apos;s a lot of energy, but the execution of the shots is poor. It&apos;s a free-for-all. It&apos;s like going to a boxing match and the crowd are in the ring. They need to get their balance and take some proper shots. There&apos;s even a backhand punch. It&apos;s a girly shot. Russia, March 2005. Liberal Democratic party leader erupts over pro-Kremlin dominance in legislature   The man with the beard stays on his feet quite well. He&apos;s got decent footwork and there&apos;s some good work to the body just before he falls over. I think his jacket is holding him back a bit. He&apos;s half getting undressed, half trying to land a big right hand. But I can definitely see some talent.

The ostensible subject doesn&apos;t matter: the one thing that&apos;s guaranteed is that below the line someone will ask: &quot;What about the British? Why can&apos;t we be indigenous?&quot; Examples on the site this year have been legion. The commenters concerned are \u2013 surely unwittingly \u2013 aligning themselves with the nationalist myth-making of the far right. Nick Griffin used his Question Time appearance to declare: &quot;The indigenous people of this island are the English, the Scots, the Welsh and the Irish \u2026 We are the aborigines here,&quot; and both his party, the BNP, and the English Defence League regularly invoke the UN declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. They&apos;re not the only one. Other European anti-immigrant parties have sought to align their quest to restrict immigration with the politics of indigeneity. A poster by the Italian political party Lega Nord, for example, portrays a stereotypical 19th-century Plains Indian warrior accompanied with the slogan: &quot;They were subjected to immigration \u2013 now they live on reservations!&quot; In the first half of the 20th century, the image of the indigene was adopted by the European far right as an exemplar of nobility, strength and resistance. At the beginning of the 21st century, the far right seeks to adopt a curious narrative of victimhood. The argument has a certain superficial logic: if people accrue additional rights by virtue of being indigenous, then surely the indigenous British should also have these additional rights, over and above &quot;non-indigenous&quot; inhabitants. If indigenous peoples have the internationally recognised right to seek legislation to resist cultural dilution, surely indigenous British (or Europeans) can do the same with regard to &quot;unwanted&quot; immigration. If simply being first is what matters, surely this has to apply in every instance. The problem here is with defining the term &quot;indigenous&quot;. The dictionary definitions are of little help. After all, most people were born in the country in which they live and thus surely &quot;originate&quot; there; on the other hand, go back far enough in history and no group outside Olduvai, in eastern Africa, can lay claim to being truly &quot;native&quot;. Reflecting this difficulty, the International Labour Organisation, the UN and the World Bank have all chosen not to offer definitions so much as interpretations in their respective declarations on the rights of indigenous peoples. Social anthropologists such as Adam Kuper argue that this is because, in truth, the term is simply being used as a replacement for the &quot;ghostly category of &apos;primitive peoples&apos;,&quot; and that it is just as problematic as that discredited idea. In legal and political contexts, then, &quot;indigenous&quot; has to be understood as a complex term that is conditional on current circumstance, not as an absolute and unchanging descriptor for a state of being. It specifically recognises that a people or tribe has become marginalised within the dominant society thanks to a history of conquest, colonisation, and/or absorption into a nation state. As the sociologist and anthropologist Mathias Guenther puts it: &quot;Indigenous is a term applied to people \u2013 and by the people to themselves \u2013 who are engaged in an often desperate struggle for political rights, for land, for a place and space within a modern nation&apos;s economy and society.&quot; This is why there is frequently a dual emphasis on a group&apos;s describing itself as indigenous, and its acceptance as such by other indigenous groups. To say that these peoples are sometimes disadvantaged is to put it mildly. The Baaka and similar groups in the Republic of the Congo live in appalling conditions, treated as virtual slaves. The process of colonial displacement is ongoing in many South American countries, leading to warnings that entire peoples are still in danger of being wiped out. Even groups sometimes seen in comparison as stable or even privileged, such as Native American nations or the Maori, continue to have considerably lower life expectancy and higher rates of alcoholism and poverty than non-indigenous citizens of their countries. The fierce insistence of indigenous people on cultural autonomy is in the face of dominant group attempts at cultural genocide. Indigenous peoples have repeatedly been denied the right to speak their own languages, or practice their own religions. Although westerners may automatically be inclined to think of Canadian Indian residential schools or the Stolen Generations of Australia, similar actions have been carried out against many other groups, such as the indigenous Taiwanese. It could certainly be argued that the word &quot;indigenous&quot; \u2013 and related terms such as native, aboriginal, autochthonous and &quot;first peoples&quot; \u2013 is unhelpful in its stress on &quot;being first&quot;. However, to put it bluntly, this is the term that we have, and it at least does its job of bringing together related problems suffered by some of the contemporary world&apos;s most marginalised peoples in their increasingly hopeful quests for self-determination. Putting the argument into this context explains why the attempt by the far right (and some Cif commenters) to hijack the term to support an anti-immigration stance is profoundly offensive. To use the travails of certain minority groups as a justification for attacking or excluding other minority groups is simply a nonsense. The popularity of the association, however, shows just how deeply certain groups feel themselves alienated from their own nation. The co-opting of the term &quot;indigenous&quot; and its associated &quot;rights&quot; must be seen in those terms \u2013 as a byword for disenfranchisement and a cynical attempt to legitimise the targeting of minority ethnic groups."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/20/cold-weather-uk-gas-demand", "publicationDate": "2010-12-20T20:45:17Z", "tags": ["Gas", "Energy", "Fossil fuels", "Environment", "Gas", "Business", "UK news", "Weather", "Winter"], "sentences": ["Countries such as China, Japan, Taiwan, the US, Brazil and Argentina are using increasing quantities of LNG, leaving it open to potentially significant price rises if other sources of gas fail to satisfy demand, analysts said."], "title": "Cold weather turns UK gas demand up to record levels", "article": "Britain&apos;s gas system is under unprecedented pressure after cold weather pushed demand to a new record today. Gas consumption hit an all-time high of 465.8m cubic metres today as people opted to work from home instead of braving the icy roads to the office, and turned the heating up a notch or two, according to initial estimates by National Grid, the network operator. The increased gas consumption will add about \u00a310 to the average household&apos;s energy bill this week. Each one-degree drop below the typical temperature for the time of year adds 29p a day in extra heating costs, according to the National Energy Action charity. The jump in demand also pushed the wholesale price of gas to its highest level for over two years, which could potentially feed through into higher costs per unit for some consumers if the freeze persists. Anticipating the surge in gas use, National Grid issued a &quot;gas balancing alert&quot; \u2013 warning of pending shortages \u2013 yesterday. This is the sixth such alert since the code was introduced in 2005 and the first to be issued as early in the winter as December. The continuation of unseasonably high demand for gas is testing Britain&apos;s supply network, which relies on imports for about half of the gas consumed \u2013 a far cry from just 10 years ago when the North Sea satisfied the UK&apos;s entire demand. The loss of gas independence has made the UK far more susceptible to global fluctuations in demand and left the nation competing with emerging markets such as China for some supplies. Britain is Europe&apos;s largest consumer of gas, getting through about 100bn cubic metres a year \u2013 a third of the country&apos;s total energy consumption. Residential uses such as heating and cooking account for about half, with power generation accounting for much of the rest. &quot;Our system hasn&apos;t been tested in this way since we&apos;ve become much more dependent on imports. The supply of the gas market has changed a lot in the past two years, but we will get the gas in,&quot; said Edward Cox, of the London-based energy information and consultant ICIS Heren. &quot;It is very early to get this high level of demand for gas \u2013 we&apos;ve never had a December where demand for gas has been this high,&quot; Cox added. He said he did not expect Britain to run out of gas, before adding: &quot;There is always scope for something unplanned, like a big issue at a terminal and if you are already a bit pushed, there is less scope for things to go wrong.&quot; Far more likely, Cox said, is that the sustained cold weather could eventually see us &quot;paying significantly more&quot; for gas. In the past two years the UK&apos;s use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) \u2013 which is brought into the country by ship, heated up and pumped into the grid \u2013 has gone from virtually nothing to account for about a fifth of total gas consumption. In contrast to supplies from Norway, Belgium and the Netherlands, which are delivered through an interconnector linking Britain to mainland Europe, the UK must compete globally for supplies of LNG. Countries such as China, Japan, Taiwan, the US, Brazil and Argentina are using increasing quantities of LNG, leaving it open to potentially significant price rises if other sources of gas fail to satisfy demand, analysts said. The so-called spot price of gas hit 71.5 pence per therm today, the highest level in at least two years and nearly double the level of 38p it was at this time last year. National Grid today insisted that Britain was well prepared for the continuing cold snap. Chris Train, National Grid&apos;s network operations director, said: &quot;Increased demand for energy is an inevitable consequence of the cold weather as Britain shivers. However, we remain well supplied with gas and electricity.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 21 December 2010. The original referred to Edward Cox of ICIS Helen.

Randt, Jr. Reasons 1.4 (b/d). Summary ------- 1. (C) At the January 25 bi-weekly G-5 Chiefs of Mission gathering, German Ambassador Schaefer described the recent reconciliation between China and Germany, announced upcoming visits by the Vice-Chancellor and Minister of the Environment and called the recent P5-plus-1 meeting a &quot;good show of solidarity.&quot; UK Ambassador Ehrman described the excellent personal relations between Prime Minister Brown and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and the accomplishments during Brown&apos;s recent visit to China, including the signing of several Memoranda of Understanding. Upcoming British high-level visits include the Foreign Minister in February and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in April. Japanese Ambassador Miyamoto said that Prime Minister Fukuda&apos;s December 27-30 visit was a success, the highlight being a speech given at Beijing University in which Fukuda called for greater Japanese-Sino cooperation on international relations. Fukuda also visited the birthplace of Confucius as a reminder to the Japanese public of the shared cultural heritage of Japan and China. End Summary. Participants ------------ 2. (C) German Ambassador Dr. Michael Schaefer hosted French Ambassador Herve Ladsous, Japanese Ambassador Yuji Miyamoto, UK Ambassador William Ehrman and the Ambassador January 25 for the bi-weekly G-5 gathering of Beijing-based Chiefs of Mission. Reconciliation between Germany and China ---------------------------------------- 3. (C) Germany and China, whose relations had soured in the wake of Chancellor Angela Merkel&apos;s September 23 meeting with the Dalai Lama, began to thaw when German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier met Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi at the Annapolis Conference November 26-27. At that meeting, Yang suggested an exchange of letters to clarify Germany&apos;s position on China, Taiwan and the one China policy. In its letter, Germany reaffirmed its positions that &quot;Taiwan and Tibet are integral parts of China,&quot; that Germany does not support separatism and opposes the Taiwan referendum on UN membership. The German letter also stated that Sino-German relations are founded on &quot;mutual respect, equality and a concern for each other&apos;s key international interests.&quot; China asked the German government to consider additions to the letter, but the Germans refused. In its letter of acknowledgement, China added a &quot;confirmation&quot; regarding German non-interference in China&apos;s internal affairs, which the German letter had not mentioned. Given the delicate nature of the situation, however, the German Government decided not to argue the point. At a later meeting with Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Wu Hongbo, German Ambassador Schaefer said the German Chancellor can and will meet &quot;whomever she wants, whenever she wants.&quot; German Ambassador Schaefer noted that different countries have received different treatment following their leaders&apos; meetings with the Dalai Lama. He said the United States escaped virtually unscathed while the Austrian Ambassador to this day remains &quot;a pariah,&quot; unable to meet even a Director General at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. German Vice-Chancellor Visit ---------------------------- 4. (C) German Foreign Minister Steinmeier will come to China in his capacity as Vice-Chancellor May 17-19 to visit Chongqing as part of a series of visits with the theme &quot;Better Cities, Better Life.&quot; The visit will feature workshops on the environment and sustainable development, cultural exchanges including rock music concerts to attract a relatively young audience and professional training. The first such visit was held in Nanjing last October. The German and French Ambassadors both noted that the Mayor and the Executive Deputy Mayor of Chongqing are impressive and independent-minded. German Minister of the Environment Visit ---------------------------------------- 5. (C) German Minister of the Environment Sigmar Gabriel will visit China January 30-February 1 beginning in Guangzhou and continuing to Beijing. Topics of the visit will include nuclear safety and electronic waste. Ambassador Schaefer noted that the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has become considerably more difficult to work with, particularly since Chen Deming moved to the Ministry of Commerce. Germans On P5-plus-1, Iranian Banks BEIJING 00000332 002.2 OF 003 ----------------------------------- 6. (C) German Ambassador Schaefer said that from the German point of view, the P5-plus-1 (P3-plus-3) meeting in Berlin was &quot;good,&quot; as it showed cohesion among the six parties, who demonstrated a continued willingness to negotiate if Iran stops enrichment activities. The new UNSC resolution will be a combination of UNSC resolutions 1737 and 1747 with added elements that will send a clear signal to the people of Iran in advance of upcoming elections that the Iranian government is &quot;going in the wrong direction.&quot; Germany has implemented effective new rules for banks that deal with Iran, Schaefer said. The rules are not full sanctions, but a &quot;name and shame practice&quot; that requires increased supervision for banks that deal with Iran. As a result of these rules, Schaefer claimed that no German banks are willing to conduct business with Iranian banks and even Chinese and Russian banks have increased their supervision of Iranian dealings. UK Prime Minister Brown Visit ----------------------------- 7. (C) UK Ambassador Ehrman said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Chinese President Hu Jintao and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao share an interest in economic growth, health and education, which provided a basis for good personal interaction. Brown and Wen struck such a good relationship that when Brown&apos;s visit continued in Shanghai, Wen accompanied him, despite not having prior plans to do so. During the visit, both sides agreed to hold an Economic and Financial Dialogue at the Vice Premier-level and the UK invited the Chinese Sovereign Wealth Fund, the China Investment Corporation, to establish an office in London, provided the fund remains transparent and commercially-motivated. During his time in Shanghai, Brown also confirmed British participation in the Shanghai World Expo in 2010. Brown and Wen also discussed Burma. Brown urged China to press the Burmese regime to allow Aung San Suu Kyi to hold weekly meetings with her associates. Accomplishments During the Brown Visit -------------------------------------- 8. (C) During Brown&apos;s visit, the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the city of Dongtan (near Shanghai) on creating a sustainable city. Dongtan is a model environmental city with a goal of zero carbon emissions. The British MOU established, inter alia, a &quot;virtual academy&quot; on sustainability with a large number of British and Chinese universities. The UK signed a second MOU with the city of Wuhan, also on sustainable development. During Brown&apos;s visit, the two countries agreed to redouble joint efforts to reach the benchmarks of the UN&apos;s Millennium Development Goals. The British also established a regular exchange program to allow young Chinese politicians to visit Britain. Finally, British pharmaceutical companies agreed to establish health programs in China. UK-China Dialogue on International Organizations --------------------------------------------- --- 9. (C) Wen and Brown agreed that UN should increase the number of taskforces dedicated to Peacekeeping and Reconstruction. Brown shared the view that the World Bank should concentrate more on environmental protection and that the IMF should play a watchdog role and seek to increase transparency. After a pause, Wen conceded that increased stability was worth the difficulties that come with transparency. UK-China Entrepreneurs Lunch ---------------------------- 10. (C) Brown&apos;s party included 30 high-ranking business people, as well as 250-300 other representatives from British businesses, who met with Chinese counterparts. Approximately 30 Chinese and British entrepreneurs, including British billionaire Richard Branson met at a lunch devoted to &quot;What Makes a Good Entrepreneur?&quot; The Chinese participants criticized British entrepreneurs as being &quot;overeducated, too conservative, lacking passion for entrepreneurship and too afraid of failure.&quot; Branson agreed that British entrepreneurs are overeducated and that schooling does not prepare one for entering the business world. The Chinese also criticized their own system as inadequate to prepare people for entrepreneurship. High-Level Visits To and From Britain ------------------------------------- 11. (C) British Foreign Minister David Miliband will visit China for six days beginning February 26. His trip will include stops in Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling will visit China in mid-April. In BEIJING 00000332 003.2 OF 003 February, State Councilor Tang Jiaxuan will visit Britain as a part of a cultural festival called &quot;China Now!&quot; He is head of the Chinese delegation to the bilateral U.K.-Sino Task Force, chaired by Alistair Darling on the U.K. side. Fukuda&apos;s Successful Visit ------------------------- 12. (C) Japanese Ambassador Miyamoto said that Japanese Prime Minister Fukuda received a warm welcome during his visit to China December 27-30. Fukuda had defended good Sino-Japanese relations while serving as the Chief Cabinet Minister under Koizumi, and the Chinese Government had promised that his visit would be a success. Parliamentary problems kept Fukuda from arranging his visit until the last moment, but the trip nonetheless went smoothly. Deeper Meaning to Fukuda&apos;s Beijing University Speech --------------------------------------------- ------- 13. (C) Fukuda&apos;s speech at Beijing University was the highlight of his visit, Miyamoto said. During the speech, Fukuda noted that China and Japan are both big enough to play major roles in international relations; however, cooperation between the two is necessary for each to do so. Fukuda&apos;s visit to Qufu, the birthplace of Confucius, aimed to send a signal to Japanese audiences concerning the shared cultural heritage of Japan and China. Before the visit, the Chinese had asked Fukuda to make a statement on Taiwan, but given the physical proximity of Taiwan to Japan, Fukuda had been unwilling to do so. The Japanese Embassy, among others, had been thus been surprised when during his visit Fukuda made a voluntary statement that Japan would not support a Taiwan referendum on UN membership if it led Taiwan to &quot;take unilateral action to change the status quo.&quot; French High-Level Visitors -------------------------- 14. (C) French Ambassador Ladsous reported that the French Government had followed up in several ways after President Sarkozy&apos;s successful November 25-27 visit. French officials had made visits concerning nuclear energy, emerging diseases and secure biological laboratories for extremely infectious diseases. France also plans a large law enforcement delegation including the Director General of Police, the Head of the Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (the French Counterintelligence Unit), the Chief of the Border Police, and the Chief of the Judiciary Police. These visitors will discuss Olympic security, counternarcotics, organized crime, and police training. Currently, Chinese police undergo training in France, and the French Government is also considering sending trainers to China. In April, former French Presidents Valery Giscard d&apos;Estaing and Jacques Chirac plan to visit, as well as Prime Minister Francois Fillon and President of the French Senate Christian Poncelet. The French will also hold their strategic dialogue later this year, with a sub-dialogue on South America. French President Nicolas Sarkozy (along with other European leaders) will also visit China in October to attend the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) summit. Olympics Attendees ------------------ 15. (C) Princess Anne will represent the UK at the 2008 Olympics Opening Ceremony. Prime Minister Brown will attend the Closing Ceremony, to receive the handoff for the 2012 Olympics. French President Sarkozy will attend the Opening Ceremony, Prime Minister Fillon will attend the Closing Ceremony and Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner will attend the Paralympics. Japanese Crown Prince Naruhito is considering attending the opening ceremonies. Other Issues ------------ 16. (C) Ambassador Miyamoto noted that the Japanese Government is sponsoring over 4,000 young people as part of a Japanese-Sino youth exchange. The French and German Ambassadors noted their governments had sponsored &quot;millions&quot; of young people in exchanges with China over the years. The French and German Ambassadors also both noted an increase in Chinese purchases of lower quality pig meat, such as offal."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/dec/28/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2010-12-28T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology"], "sentences": ["Apple to ship 5-6M Verizon iPhones in Q1 2011 &gt;&gt; Vator.tv&quot;Apple is gearing up to ship 20-21m iPhones next quarter, an increase of 1-2m from the company&apos;s previous goal of 19m units, according to unnamed sources with Taiwan-based component suppliers who spoke to DigiTimes."], "title": "The Technology newsbucket: getting women into IT, Facebook's Like tracking, Apple's iPhone plans and more", "article": "It&apos;s not that different for girls.

The curators, Christophe Sand, the head of the New Caledonia Institute of Archaeology, and Stuart Bedford, from Canberra University, have also chosen some magnificent ceramics, in particular large pots discovered in 1995 at Kon\u00e9, in the north of New Caledonia, funeral pottery dug up in 2004 in the cemetery of Teouma in Vanuatu, and from Tubuai, in the Austral Islands, a small male head in mother-of-pearl and a paddle. Maps and videos describe the Lapita&apos;s travels, but also the story of their discovery. In 1909 Father Otto Meyer picked up a shard of pottery decorated with angular patterns on a Papua New Guinea beach. Then, in 1950 a French geologist compared Meyer&apos;s shards with recent finds from the Isle of Pines, south of New Caledonia, and realised that they belonged to the same tradition. The term &quot;Lapita&quot; was coined in 1952: an American, Edwin Gifford, was digging on the Fou\u00e9 peninsula. He asked a Kanak for the name of the site, but mistook the response, xapeta&apos;a, for &quot;Lapita&quot;. In the Haveka language spoken by the Kanaks xapeta&apos;a means &quot;the place where one digs&quot;. It was assumed initially that this referred to the work of the archaeologists. But it finally emerged that the Kanaks had understood that the land had been settled before their arrival. Herein lies the exhibition&apos;s political significance. &quot;Given the situation in New Caledonia, this discovery was enormously important,&quot; Sand says. &quot;For a long time the Kanaks, who claimed first-people status, rejected the idea of any earlier settlement. Then the colonists used the sophistication of Lapita art to prove that there had been a more intelligent, more developed people than the Kanaks.&quot; Only in 2002 did they recognise the memory of the Oceanic civilisation.

Officials in Beijing said they were willing to discuss incentives for turbine manufacturers, which the Obama administration described as &quot;illegal subsidies&quot; in a request for talks on the subject at the World Trade Organisation. The US claims China has given an unfair advantage to domestic companies by channelling hundreds of millions of dollars to them through a special fund established in 2008. The United Steelworkers union is frustrated that this weakens the competitiveness of US firms such as General Electric in a Chinese market that has doubled in size almost every year since 2005 and is now the biggest in the world in terms of generating capacity. Beijing insists its wind policies are good for the global environment and within trade rules, but was conciliatory. &quot;China will conscientiously study the US request for consultations, and will deal with this in accordance with WTO dispute settlement rules, while retaining our corresponding rights,&quot; the Chinese commerce ministry said. Government advisers were, however, scathing. Professor Pan Jiahua, of the sustainable development research centre at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the symbolic impact is significant. &quot;At a global level, the US action is terrible. This gives a very bad signal for the world. It says renewable energy technologies\u00a0should not be encouraged.&quot; Despite this spat, the US and China closed the year on a positive note on many fronts \u2013 including trade, military ties, climate change and global security \u2013 as they prepared for their presidents&apos; second summit on 19 January. Obama visited China in November 2009. After a tense year during which US officials, including Barack Obama, openly criticised China, and their Chinese counterparts returned the favour, there was a sudden switch in tone from the US. Instead of portraying China as protectionist or as an &quot;enabler&quot; of North Korea&apos;s provocations, US officials were praising China, referring to it again as a responsible partner. In part, the improved tone reflects Washington&apos;s success in leveraging Beijing&apos;s desire for a smooth summit to get concessions from China or nudge it toward policies closer to Washington&apos;s liking. That said, significant problems bedevil the relationship between the world&apos;s sole superpower and a surging counterpart that is both partner and rival. &quot;You&apos;ve got leaders in the US and in China that want to do everything possible to limit direct confrontation,&quot; said Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm, &quot;but structurally, both countries are going to have a hard time avoiding it.&quot; Administration officials commended China for soft-pedaling a proposal to hold emergency talks among South and North Korea, China, Russia, Japan and the US as part of a way to calm the tension in the region. Instead, the officials said China had accepted a US plan that put improving ties between the South and the North ahead of any multilateral talks on the North&apos;s nuclear weapons programme. President Hu Jintao plans to highlight the positive aspects of China&apos;s ties with the US. Among other summit events, he is expected to visit a Chinese-owned car parts plant and a joint US-China clean-energy project. China is also considering a request to hold a joint news conference with Obama, something Hu rarely does. All year, US and Chinese officials have bickered over economic issues, specifically access to China&apos;s markets and China&apos;s unwillingness to allow the yuan to appreciate against the dollar. But again the tone has shifted. When the US-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade wrapped up a meeting in Washington on 15 December, US officials hailed China&apos;s co-operation. China said it would open new technology and agriculture markets for US products and would toughen enforcement of intellectual property and software piracy laws. There&apos;s been another U-turn on military relations. China froze those ties in January, after the administration announced plans to sell Taiwan $6.4bn in weapons. Throughout the year, Chinese officers criticised the US. But on 13 December under-secretary of defence Michele Flournoy met General Ma Xiaotian, deputy chief of the general staff of the People&apos;s Liberation Army, and Flournoy was full of praise for her Chinese counterpart. She said that shegave Ma and his entourage the same briefings on the US nuclear, ballistic missile and space postures &quot;that we gave our closest allies&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/dec/28/inside-guardian-weekly", "publicationDate": "2010-12-28T16:59:26Z", "tags": [], "sentences": ["And also in Paris, we find an unusual perspective on the Pacific, through an exhibition on the Lapita people, who left Taiwan in about 2,000BC and fanned out as far as Samoa in little more than a millennia."], "title": "Inside the 31 December edition", "article": "For the Weekly team, 2010 is now over. We&apos;ve sent winging on its way to readers this edition, and are starting on the next. But there are some strong themes running through it that are only likely to continue into 2011. We lead the paper with the relationship between the US and China, and the attempts both are making to smooth relations. The areas of conflict emerge in stories through the edition - we look at how the US is seeking to re-open a rare earths mine on its soil, to give it guaranteed access to minerals essential to many hi-tech applications that are now only produced in China. And we examine the world&apos;s superpower&apos;s economic problems - specifically those of its cities, which together with many in Europe are facing what might be insurmountable debt mountains. Yet the rising giant also has its problems - we examine concerns about its food supply, as the communist giant struggles to contain inflation, particularly on staple supplies. Away from the geopolitics, my favourite story of the week is of an office move - but what an office: the Maison de Sciences de l&apos;Homme in Paris was packing up and Le Monde&apos;s Beatrice Gurrey was there, to taste and smell the atmosphere as the history of some of the great figures of the French intelligentsia, from Braudel to Bourdieu, Furet to Touraine, was moved on. And also in Paris, we find an unusual perspective on the Pacific, through an exhibition on the Lapita people, who left Taiwan in about 2,000BC and fanned out as far as Samoa in little more than a millennia. It&apos;s a big edition - I hope that you enjoy it, and wish all readers all the best for the new year. Quote of the week: &quot;This is an appeal to citizens, young and old, to take responsibility for the things in our society that don&apos;t work. I wish every one of your to find your own reason for indignation. It&apos;s precious.&quot; Stephanie Hessel, 93, the author who is topping the French best-seller list Fact of the week: Fishing has been expanding southwards at roughly one degree of latitude per year to compensate for the fact that humans have depleted fish stocks closer to their shores in the northern hemisphere.

The company emails its 35 million subscribers with targeted daily deals from local businesses and is by some measures the fastest-growing internet firm ever. In two years the company has sold 18m coupons in the US, expanded to 35 countries and has 3,000 staff, mostly in sales. According to a regulatory filing, Groupon is seeking to issue 30.1m preferred shares of stock at $31.59 a share \u2013 about $950m. The private share issue would value the two-year-old firm at up to $7.8bn, according to VC Experts, the financial website that first reported the move. Earlier this month, Groupon rejected a buyout offer from Google reported to be worth about $6bn. Andrew Mason, founder and chief executive, is believed to be studying the possibility of floating the company on the stock market. Mason confirmed via Twitter that the company was looking for new funds. &quot;Groupon is in the process of completing a new round of financing \u2013 we&apos;ll let everyone know when there&apos;s more to announce,&quot; he wrote. Groupon has been aggressively beefing up its business in recent months. The company recently bought a local marketing company, Ludic Labs, and has begun expanding around the world. Groupon operates in Britain and recently bought rivals in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. The company has also recruited Jason Child, Amazon&apos;s vice-president of finance, as its chief financial officer. If Groupon raises $950m, it would be the largest equity financing since Pixar sought about $500m in 1995. Backers include the venture capital firms Accel Partners and New Enterprise Associates, Chicago-based investors Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell and the Russian firm Mail.ru Group, a Facebook backer formerly named Digital Sky Technologies. The firm makes its money by taking a 50% cut of each discount coupon soldon its website."}]}
