The emergence of the hi-tech weaponry - which would make it more difficult for the US navy and air force to project power close to Taiwan and elsewhere on China&apos;s coastline - comes at a politically sensitive time. Later this month, President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao, will hold a summit in Washington aimed at patching up their differences after a niggling year in bilateral relations. The photograph, of what appears to be a prototype J-20 jet undergoing runway tests, has been circulating on the internet since last week, fuelling speculation that China&apos;s fifth-generation fighter may fly ahead of forecast. The defence ministry has yet to comment on the image, which seems to have been shot from long-distance near the Chengdu aircraft design institute. The photographer is also unknown, which has added to the mystery about its origins and authenticity as well as the motive of the distributor. But defence analysts believe this is the first glimpse of the twin-engined, chiselled-nosed plane that mixes Russian engine technology with a fuselage design similar to that of the US air force&apos;s F-22 &quot;stealth&quot; fighter, which can avoid detection by radar. If confirmed, it would be an impressive step forward for the Chinese air force, which until now has largely depended on foreign-made or designed planes. &quot;I&apos;d say these are, indeed, genuine photos of a prototype that will make its maiden flight very soon,&quot; said Peter Felstead, the editor of Jane&apos;s Defence Weekly. The J20 is likely to be many years from deployment, but the US defence secretary, Robert Gates - who visits Beijing next week - may have to revise an earlier prediction that China will not have a fifth generation aircraft by 2020. It is not the only challenge to US superiority in the region. China has refurbished a Ukranian aircraft carrier and wants to build its own by 2020. A more immediate threat is posed by China&apos;s adaptation of an intermediate-range ballistic missile - the DF-21D - to target US aircraft carriers. This project is also further advanced than previously believed. Admiral Robert Willard, the US navy&apos;s commander in the Pacific, warned last month that the weapon - nicknamed the &quot;carrier killer&apos; - had reached &quot;initial operational capability&quot;. Faced by this threat US battle groups are likely to take a more withdrawn position if there is a standoff over Taiwan than they did in 1996, when the USS Nimitz sailed through the strait. &quot;The main implication of China deploying this system is that it would certainly make the US navy pause before deciding to project naval power into the South China Sea region during a time of tension,&quot; said Felstead. But China&apos;s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, said today that his country had no ambitions to rival US military power in the western Pacific region. &quot;We do not see ourselves as rivals to the US. We believe the US and China can work together in the region,&quot; Liu said, arguing there was a double standard in the west towards Chinese defence spending. &quot;When China carries out an exercise on its own territory there is a lot of attention, but when the United States comes all the way across the Pacific for exercises with its allies, no one speaks about it in the same way. There is a cold war mentality still. If you develop your defence capability, they [the Americans] are annoyed. But our defence construction is purely for self-defence. China&apos;s defence expenditure is still the lowest among the five permament members of the [UN] security council.&quot; China&apos;s military advances worry many in the east Asian region who have benefited for decades from the US-policed status quo. In its latest defence white paper, Japan noted that China&apos;s military spending had nearly quadrupled over the past decade, while its own shrank by 4% due to a stagnant economy. Officials in Tokyo have also expressed alarm at the increasingly confrontational approach of Chinese vessels in disputed fisheries. In Washington, rightwing thinktanks and commentators want Obama and Gates to apply diplomatic pressure on China to join the intermediate nuclear forces (INF) treaty and halt its missile buildup. The photographs of the J20 jet are also likely to prompt calls for accelerated production of F22s - the US&apos;s most advanced stealth fighter - to ensure air superiority. The US remains the most potent military force in the western Pacific with 60,000 troops, a military airbase in Okinawa and one forward-deployed carrier fleet. The US also outspends China on defence by a ratio of six to one, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Even so, while China&apos;s economy grows rapidly and the US remains sluggish, fears of a shift in the balance of power are likely to grow. It will not happen overnight and worldwide, but China appears to be steadily pushing the US back from its shores in a strategy know as &quot;area denial&quot;. The government has not confirmed this approach. Chinese nationalists want their country to be more assertive, but they say the priority is to improve defence of an increasingly wealthy coastal region. The &quot;area denial&quot; strategy can be seen as China trying to manage its own market and routes to main trading partners such as South Korea and Japan. &quot;We don&apos;t need the US to be the policeman in the west Pacific area,&quot; said Song Xiaojun, a former naval officer who now edits military magazines. &quot;China&apos;s priority is to develop its near sea defence, because our economy is concentrated on the coast. But we have to reconsider the concept of &apos;near sea&apos; to fit a modern age in which military threats can come from far away. China must improve its defences, but that does not mean we are a threat. Only arms merchants would say that to persuade the US to raise military spending. The US is far ahead,&quot; he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 January 2011. In the original, the next US generation of stealth fighter was given as the F35.

In short, it looks at the complexities and sometimes tensions in the working relationships between WikiLeaks and the multiple media organisations with access to the cables. Media and tech bloggers have been most interested in the detail that Julian Assange threatened to sue the Guardian, fearing it may use a full set of the cables leaked to freelance journalist Heather Brooke (who had joined the Guardian team) in order to publish without his permission. After what the piece calls a &quot;marathon session&quot; in the Guardian editor-in-chief&apos;s office, all parties agreed to a delay in publication. The piece also delves tensions within WikiLeaks, how those in the organisation who aren&apos;t Assange see what it was and what it has become. Perhaps complexities within Assange&apos;s position too: it ends with the assessment that &quot;compared with others in his world of internet provocateurs, Assange is almost a traditionalist \u2013 one of the few of his kind willing to work with the mainstream press and conform, at least fleetingly, to some of their standards.&quot;  \u2022 A spokesman for Zimbabwe&apos;s Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has called recent cable leaks on the country &quot;harmless thunderbolts&quot; and said ordinary Zimbabweans are actually more worried about the &quot;leaks in their roofs&quot;. US diplomats report in the leaked cables conversations where MDC officials discuss options to peacefully force Robert Mugabe, of the rival Zanu-PF, to step down as president. Zimbabwe&apos;s attorney general has theatened action, though the MDC spokesman, Nelson Chamisa, told South African radio the party - in an uneasy coalition with Zanu-PF - was not daunted.  Meanwhile, Anonymous has claimed attacks on Zimbabwean government websites. \u2022\u00a0Deep-sea explorers have introduced a WikiLeaks release into a legal battle with the Spanish government over sunken treasure. A cable published last month revealed the US state department had offered to help Spain against Florida-based Odyssey Marine Exploration, who found 17 tons of coins in a Spanish galleon, in return for Madrid&apos;s help in returning a painting seized by the Nazis to a US citizen.  The divers have filed a motion asking the appeal court hearing the case to require the US government to note its interests.  11.35am: We linked several times to Aftenposten yesterday, the Norwegian newspaper that got a leak of the leaks. Without its prior knowledge, Assange now calls Aftenposten a &quot;media partner&quot;, according to a brief interview snatched by Norwegian paper Dagens N\u00e6ringsliv outside Beccles police station on Tuesday evening. Aftenposten&apos;s editor, Hilde Haugsgjerd, denied her title is a WikiLeaks partner. &quot;It&apos;s amazing to hear him say it. We are not a media partner of Wikileaks,&quot; she said.  If you click through to the piece, you can see that Assange did indeed go to his Tuesday bail check-in without shoes, as reported by a commenter on this blog yesterday.  12.15pm: Wired&apos;s blog on the Vanity Fair article picks up on the fleshing out of what Bradley Manning&apos;s instant messenger chat called the &quot;Gitmo papers&quot;.  Rather than the already-leaked Guant\u00e1namo operation manuals, as many supposed he was talking about, there is reference to the &quot;personal files of all prisoners who had been held at Guant\u00e1namo&quot; as part of WikiLeaks&apos; cache of documents.  12.40pm: US businesses, including Coca-Cola, complained to US diplomats about corruption at an Israeli-controlled crossing point into Gaza, according to a 2006 cable published by Aftenposten. A Coca-Cola distributor told the diplomats that a $3,000 payment per truck would get it &quot;the first place in line or a spot near the head of the so-called &apos;Israeli line&apos; which does move&quot;. He said the two or three &quot;Israeli lines&quot; at the Karni crossing point moved much quicker than the others.  3.25pm: Media in Australia are reporting that Australian officials told the US embassy in Canberra that China&apos;s military spending in 2006 was double the $45bn it publicly announced, according to what is reported to be a cable released from WikiLeaks. The Australians reportedly said China&apos;s military expansion was &quot;beyond the scope of what would be required for a conflict over Taiwan&quot; and that they believed that Beijing arguably already posed a &quot;credible threat to modern militaries operating in the region.&quot;  5.20pm: This blog is now closing for the day.

Japan and the US proposed to investigate and act against international anti-whaling activists from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society as part of a political deal to reduce whaling in Antarctic waters. Four confidential cables from the US embassy in Tokyo and the state department in Washington, released by WikiLeaks, show US and Japanese diplomats secretly negotiating a compromise agreement ahead of a key meeting last year of the International Whaling Commission, the body that regulates international whaling.

Gatz was a word-for-word presentation of F\u00a0Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s jazz age masterpiece, The Great Gatsby, by an experimental group, the Elevator Repair Service. Artfully staged to dramatise a group of office workers falling under the spell of Fitzgerald&apos;s hypnotic prose, Gatz transmitted its magic to successive audiences who became swept up in the heady rush of falling in love with a book. A six-hour marathon at the Public Theatre, Gatz became a sell-out, the hottest ticket off Broadway. But it nearly wasn&apos;t. Before it reached Manhattan, Gatz had been touring as an out-of-town production for months, while the Fitzgerald estate&apos;s lawyers wrangled with the show&apos;s producers over copyright permission. As of 1 January, however, the issue has become moot. The Great Gatsby&apos;s term of copyright is up; the novel is now in the public domain and will join such American classics as Moby-Dick and The Scarlet Letter, books freely available to one and all \u2013 readers, publishers and producers alike. The Fitzgerald lawyers were obstructive, but they were only doing their job. That&apos;s how literary estates behave. So much is at stake that copyright holders sometimes go to great lengths to protect their property. The DH Lawrence estate, for example, commissioned a brand new, scholarly edition of Lawrence&apos;s work, effectively to re-copyright its texts. The Observer&apos;s most famous literary editor, Terence Kilmartin, was also caught up in copyright shenanigans when he undertook a revision of Scott Moncrieff&apos;s translation of A\u00a0la recherche du temps perdu, a manoeuvre designed to foil rival editions. Copyright law is subject to international variations. In Japan, New Zealand and Taiwan, the term of copyright runs for 50 years after the author&apos;s death; in the Yemen it&apos;s 30. In the UK, which has a fairly standard ruling (complicated occasionally by EU directives), copyright applies for 70 years from the death of the author. In America, the copyright term is also 70 years, but this only applies to works published since 1978. Even so, in the age of &quot;free content&quot;, not everyone accepts these norms. In California, there&apos;s a radical movement that regards copyright law (of all kinds) as a grotesque \u2013 even sinister \u2013 restriction on the unfettered traffic of\u00a0knowledge. Led by James Boyle, author of Shamans, Software and Spleens: Law and the Construction of the Information Society, the Free Culture Movement wants to toss copyright legislation into the dustbin of history. Boyle, based at the Centre for the Study of the Public Domain, in North Carolina, believes the ground rules of the information society are out of date. He has begun to open up to unsentimental scrutiny the holy grail of literary copyright, asserting a new legitimacy for the commercial idea of &quot;the public domain&quot;. Writers such as Boyle are developing a theory of copyright which argues that &quot;the commons of the mind&quot; should be freed to liberate a\u00a0moribund society. Open networks, runs the argument, will immediately have a\u00a0positive effect on our culture. Indeed, it is now feasible that the copyright conventions by which publishers live and die will soon have the contemporary relevance of a papyrus. Newly digitised texts will become subject to the awesome power of online bookselling. According to Chris Anderson, the author of Free, once something becomes software it inevitably becomes free. Free speech, cultural access, digital creativity and the innovations of science have become the watchwords of the &quot;free&quot; movement, but my guess is that technology will wreak far greater change than any copyright lawyers. This recent Kindle Christmas will be seen as a turning point. For the first time, millions of people received, as gifts, the means to access the digitised treasures of our literature. The First Folio? Click. All of Dickens? Click. The Great Gatsby? Click. In this new literary landscape, in which everything seems available, the restrictions of copyright will seem increasingly perverse. Who knows what the upshot will be? One thing is certain, as Fitzgerald so memorably puts it: &quot;So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.&quot; A character-forming lesson for novelists The excellent latest edition of Prospect, now under the editorship of Bronwen Maddox, contains a thoughtful piece about creative writing schools, from Iowa to Norwich, by the occasional Observer book reviewer and first-time novelist Leo Benedictus. &quot;Like all writers in search of readers,&quot; he declares, &quot;we will always willingly exploit ourselves.&quot; The full meaning of this rash manifesto becomes clear from my advance copy of The Afterparty, &quot;a new kind of novel&quot;, according to publisher Jonathan Cape. Not only does this satire on &quot;the dark underbelly of 21st-century celebrity&quot; feature a character named Leo Benedictus who pens pieces for the Observer and Prospect, it also invites its readers into a competition to make cameo appearances in the forthcoming paperback edition. Hardly the kind of thing they teach at UEA. Farewell to one of journalism&apos;s greatsTony Howard, the celebrated and distinguished former deputy editor of the Observer, was given an appropriately splendid funeral last week at St Mary Abbots in his native Kensington.

Highlights of a politico-literary occasion, redolent of a bygone age, included readings by a brace of peers, the lords Heseltine, who read from Bunyan, and Hattersley (Donne&apos;s Devotions), capped by a witty and memorable appreciation from former Observer political editor Robert Harris. He described Howard&apos;s ill-starred attempt to mount an in-house coup in the absence of the then editor Donald Trelford, who was staying on the yacht of Tiny Rowland, who just happened to be the Observer&apos;s proprietor.

Asked whether he believed that, he added: &quot;I take President Hu at his word that the test had nothing to do with my visit.&quot; A Pentagon official told Reuters that Hu and other civilian leaders at the meeting with Gates did not appear to be aware that the J-20 flight had happened before the US questioned them about it. &quot;When Secretary Gates raised the question of the J-20 test in the meeting with President Hu, it was clear that none of the civilians in the room had been informed,&quot; the official said. Hu&apos;s confirmation came after accounts and pictures of the J-20 prototype&apos;s short flight appeared on Chinese websites. The fighter is believed to have flown over an airfield in the south-western city of Chengdu for about 15 minutes. Photographs said to show the aeroplane going through runway tests had previously been seen, but Hu&apos;s comments were the first official acknowledgement of the project. Some interpreted the timing as a sign that Beijing had heeded calls for greater transparency about its military programme, while others thought it more likely to be a show of strength.

The F-22 is the only operational stealth fighter, although the US is developing the F-35 joint strike fighter, and Russia&apos;s Sukhoi T-50 is expected to enter service in about 2015. The Associated Press reported that people who answered calls at government and Communist party offices in Chengdu and at the J-20&apos;s developer, the Chengdu Aircraft Industrial Group, had refused to comment. China&apos;s military modernisation programme and heavy investment in new technology such as the Dongfeng anti-ship missile is reducing the military gap with the US and tilting the power balance in the region.

Both sides said stronger ties were needed, and Liang made a point of warning the US against selling further arms to Taiwan. Beijing suspended military exchanges last year in protest at such a deal. The Chinese military&apos;s budget has soared to 532bn yuan (\u00a352bn), although last year&apos;s increase of 7.5% was the smallest for more than two decades. Outside experts believe the real level of funding is far higher, although it is still thought to lag well behind that of the US. &quot;Some countries, which have a far better international security situation than China, have world-leading levels of military research,&quot; the army&apos;s official newspaper, the Liberation Army Daily, wrote in an article on Gates&apos;s visit today. &quot;In such circumstances, China should not be unjustly excoriated for developing a few modern weapons.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/11/development-china-stealth-fighter-jet", "publicationDate": "2011-01-11T19:26:39Z", "tags": ["China", "Hu Jintao", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The J20 would provoke more concern in India, South Korea, and Taiwan in particular, analysts said.", "&quot;It is not going to be a global policeman, but [will] have enough strength to maintain pressure on Taiwan and defend its own maritime borders.&quot; He said that while the Obama administration was pushing hard to develop a proper dialogue with Beijing, the relative influence of China&apos;s political leaders and the military was becoming increasingly unclear."], "title": "Experts surprised by quick development of Chinese stealth fighter jet", "article": "Leading experts on China today expressed surprise at the speed with which the country&apos;s J20 stealth aircraft was developed, but said the country&apos;s military prowess was still relatively backward and way behind that of the US.

Guanglie added: &quot;The gap between us and that of advanced countries is at least two to three decades. &quot;I also want to emphasise that the efforts that we placed in research and development of our weapons systems is by no means targeted at any third country and it will by no means threaten any other country in the world.&quot; Gates said the US and Chinese militaries must become closer partners."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/10232", "publicationDate": "2011-01-13T12:11:58Z", "tags": ["Bahamas", "China", "The US embassy cables", "World news", "Americas", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Rogers indicated that the Government felt that it needed to continue to solidify Chinese confidence due to &quot;lingering distaste&quot; left from the fact that The Bahamas maintained diplomatic relations with Taiwan, including permitting a Taiwanese Embassy in Nassau, until 1999."], "title": "US embassy cables: Sidney Poitier is 'star attraction' for Bahamas trip to Japan", "article": "C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 NASSAU 001635 SIPDISE.O. 12958: DECL: 08/21/2013TAGS: PREL, ECON, EINV, PINR, PGOV, CH, JA, BF, ChinaSUBJECT: BAHAMIAN OFFICIALS VISIT TO CHINA -- COURTESY OR CONFIDANTS? Classified By: CHARGE ROBERT WITAJEWSKI FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). SUMMARY 1. (C) On August 20, the Charge, and Economic Officer met with Mrs. Patricia Rogers, the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Leonard Archer, the Bahamian Ambassador to CARICOM, and Mr. Marco Rolle, Under Secretary in the International Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the upcoming visit of Bahamian officials to China. Although the Bahamians were extremely reluctant to provide information regarding the visit to China, Dr. Rogers promised the Charge, that she would give him a briefing upon their return on September 9th. Despite deliberate attempts at ambiguity in describing the agenda for the Foreign Minister,s trip, it appears that The Bahamas will accede to a Chinese request to close their consulate in Hong Kong and open an embassy in Beijing. We urged that the GCOB also raise the issue of Chinese alien smuggling operations through The Bahamas to the United States. Rogers claimed the China visit was simply to express gratitude for Chinese technical assistance to The Bahamas. End Summary. OFFICIAL VISIT TO CHINA BY GCOB OFFICIALS 2. (C) At a meeting with Mrs. Patricia Rogers, the Charge, inquired about the upcoming Bahamian high-level visit to China from August 22nd - September 9th. Mrs. Rogers said that Minister of Foreign Affairs, Fred Mitchell, and herself amongst others planned to travel to Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, plus Japan on their whirlwind tour to Asia. Bahamian Ambassador to Japan, Sir Sidney Poitier, is to accompany the Bahamian contingent on the Japanese segment of the trip since it is coinciding with his annual trip to Japan. Rogers laughingly noted that he was to be the &quot;star attraction&quot;, and the rest of them, including the Foreign Minister, were merely along for the ride. 3. (C) Framing it as simply a &quot;follow-up to an invitation&quot;, Mrs. Rogers attempted to minimize the significance of the official trip. But after further probing, she admitted that one of the purposes of the trip was to reassure China of The Bahamas commitment to their bilateral relationship. Rogers indicated that the Government felt that it needed to continue to solidify Chinese confidence due to &quot;lingering distaste&quot; left from the fact that The Bahamas maintained diplomatic relations with Taiwan, including permitting a Taiwanese Embassy in Nassau, until 1999. 4. (C) Mrs. Rogers and Ambassador Leonard Archer both made a point of expressing gratitude towards the Chinese for their technical assistance in The Bahamas. When questioned further about the precise details of this assistance, the two responded by citing Chinese support for Bahamian handicraft, agriculture and their offer to assist in the remodeling/rebuilding of the National Center for Performing Arts located in Nassau, not Mrs. Rogers insisted a new convention center for The Bahamas. (A Chinese offer to build a massive convention center in the Cable Beach area of New Providence Island has been widely rumored to be on the table.) Mrs. Rogers also mentioned that Bahamian officials were to participate in a christening and launch of one of the Clipper Group ships. The company, she obliquely noted, had decided to register many of its ships on the Bahamian ship registry, and this would be a reciprocal gesture of appreciation. &quot;NO&quot; AGENDA WHILE IN CHINA 5. (C) When asked by the Charge, as to what the Bahamian officials had arranged with their Chinese counterparts for the visit, Mrs. Rogers paused and said that the visit was to be very informal and denied that any agenda of discussion topics had been agreed to. Responding to the Charge,s skepticism that a major visit beginning in only two days remained so unfocused, Mrs. Rogers reluctantly admitted that it was &quot;feasible&quot; that some trade and cultural agreements might be signed, but insisted that the Bahamian delegation only planned to speak about general bilateral issues. SMUGGLING CHINESE TO THE US VIA THE BAHAMAS 6. (C) The Charge, specifically questioned the Bahamian government officials about whether the issue of smuggling Chinese aliens into the United States through The Bahamas would be raised when Mrs. Rogers and Minister of Foreign Affairs Fred Mitchell visit China. Mrs. Rogers, again reluctantly, responded by saying, &quot;it,s a tricky one, but one that will have to be brought up&quot;. The Bahamians would not provide further details. CLOSING HONG KONG; OPENING IN BEIJING 7. (C) During the conversation, Mrs. Rogers did reveal that The Bahamas would discuss with Chinese officials the possibility of &quot;deactivating&quot; their consulate in Hong Kong with the intention of establishing an Embassy in Beijing. She did not indicate if Foreign Minister Mitchell and his Chinese counterpart would make an announcement to this effect while on the upcoming trip. 8. (U) Currently, the Bahamian Consulate in Hong Kong does not process visas for CARICOM members, only for Bahamian citizens. Only the embassies of Guyana and Suriname in China have that ability presently. NEW CHINESE AMBASSADOR TO BAHAMAS 9. (C) Dr. Rogers mentioned that the new Chinese Ambassador to The Bahamas, Dongcon Jiao, will be formally presenting his credentials on August 21st. She made a point of noting that &quot;he speaks perfect English.&quot; (Note: The former Chinese Ambassador, Changsheng Wu, had limited English skills and was always accompanied in public by an interpreter. Changsheng was, however, proficient in Spanish.) The Charge, noted that the Embassy had not been contacted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about receiving the new Chinese Ambassador for an introductory courtesy call, observing that Andrew McKinney, Chief of Protocol for the Bahamas, did consider Charges of appropriate rank. Mrs. Rogers appeared genuinely embarrassed, and expressed the intent to rectify the situation. COMMENT 10. (C) Mrs. Rogers, and other Bahamian officials, are reluctant to discuss the details of their relationship with the Chinese. While it appears that the dynamics of the relationship are being driven by the Chinese, for their part the Bahamians have at least two reasons for acquiescing. First, there is the $1 billion investment by Hutchison Whampoa in the Freeport Container Port. Second, a Chinese presence does -even if symbolically- serve as a counterbalance to the U.S. The interest of the Chinese is more complex however, and we defer to Embassy Beijing for its analysis of Chinese strategic goals underlying its major presence in a country where apart from geography, there would seem to be few mutual cultural, tourist, economic, or political interests.

AIG executives said today that they expected to finalise an agreement with government officials that could pave the way for the biggest stock offering in US history, worth tens of billions of dollars. AIG will convert outstanding preferred shares acquired by the US Treasury into common stock, giving the taxpayer approximately 92% of AIG&apos;s common shares when the transaction is complete. The government and AIG, which has an estimated market value of $96bn (\u00a361bn), are interviewing Wall Street banks as they decide which one will land the lucrative job of selling off the insurer&apos;s shares, a process that is being called a &quot;re-IPO.&quot; Among those pitching are other bailout recipients including JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley. The first share sale is planned for March and may top the $21.3bn raised by the selloff of another government bailout recipient, General Motors. &quot;With today&apos;s announcement, we anticipate that we will be able to deliver on our promise to the American people to repay the extraordinary assistance they provided to AIG during the financial crisis of 2008,&quot; Robert Benmosche, AIG president and chief executive, said in a statement. In addition, AIG will repay the Federal Reserve Bank of New York $21bn to cover the loans the bank made during the financial crisis. AIG has sold assets to repay the loans, including its Taiwan unit, Nan Shan Life Insurance, which it sold for $2.16bn in cash on Wednesday. The $182.3bn bailout of AIG in 2008 caused widespread anger. Staff received death threats after revelations that executives were being paid big bonuses and were attending conferences at luxury resorts. Benmosche has staunchly defended the insurer and its staff. He thanked the American people for their support. &quot;We remain grateful for their support of AIG, and we remain convinced that the American people will realize a profit on their investment in our company,&quot; he said. Last October AIG announced that Benmosche had started treatment for cancer. The 66-year-old told employees last year that he expects his health will permit him to lead AIG until after the US treasury&apos;s exit. The company is expected to give more details of Benmosche&apos;s condition and any succession plans as it finalises the sale. AIG has said a long-term replacement will be chosen within the next two years. Investors who have stuck by the company will be rewarded as part of the recapitalisation.

His parents will not know it, but his birth will prove to be a considerable landmark for our species as his arrival will mark the moment when the human population reaches 7 billion. There is no way of knowing for sure, of course, the identity of this baby boy. But demographers say that this date, place and gender are the most likely. India has the largest number of births each year \u2013 27 million, roughly one in five of all global births \u2013 and Uttar Pradesh, India&apos;s most populous state with nearly 200 million citizens, would be the sixth most-populated country in the world if it were a nation. The majority of the state&apos;s births occur in the rural areas and the natural sex ratio at birth favours boys by a narrow\u00a0margin. We do not need a guiding star to direct us to the symbolism of this boy&apos;s birth: the world has known about this approaching milestone for many years. After all, it is only 12 years since the six billion mark was reached. And just 100 years ago, the human population stood at 1.6 billion. The urgent search for solutions to population growth has been a hot topic ever since the Rev Thomas Malthus published An Essay on the Principle of Population in 1798, stating that the &quot;power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man&quot;. Every generation since has seen a prophet predicting doom for our species if we don&apos;t curtail our numbers. And yet the rise in headcount has continued inexorably and exponentially. But with rising greenhouse gas emissions and resource depletion ever-growing concerns, the approach of this year&apos;s population landmark has become an awkward, even unwelcome presence in the environmental debate. No one likes to talk about it, for there are no easy answers. Even a mention of it can see the questioner accused of racism, colonialism or misanthropy. Increasingly, environmental thinkers such as Jared Diamond, George Monbiot and Fred Pearce have made the case that population growth is not, in fact, the real problem (the UN predicts that growth will plateau at nine billion around mid-century before slowly starting to fall), rather that a rapid rise in consumption is our most pressing environmental issue. There are more than enough resources to feed the world, they say, even in 2050 when numbers peak \u2013 a point made this week by a report jointly published by France&apos;s national agricultural and development research agencies. The problem is that we see huge inequities in consumption whereby, for example, the average American has the same carbon footprint as 250 Ethiopians. The French report concluded bluntly that &quot;the rich must stop consuming so\u00a0much&quot;. Stood shoulder to shoulder, the entire human population could fit within the city limits of Los Angeles. We&apos;ve got more than enough land upon which to collectively sustain ourselves, we just need to use it more wisely and fairly. But, given the stubborn realities of global inequalities, the question remains: are there too many of us to achieve a sustainable future? Another report published this week \u2013 by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers \u2013 provocatively posed just this question in its title: &quot;One planet, too many people?&quot; It concluded the answer was &quot;no&quot;, but only if food output was vastly improved through biotechnology, mechanisation, food processing and irrigation. In essence, it said we need to innovate and think our way out of our &quot;population explosion&quot; using technology. Reducing consumption Paul Ehrlich, the Bing professor of population studies at Stanford University in California, has been a figurehead of this debate ever since his still highly controversial book The Population Bomb was published in 1968, when the human population stood at 3.5 billion. The book attracted international attention with its stark, Old Testament predictions about how devastating famines would ravage the human populace in the 1970s and 80s and how &quot;all important animal life&quot; in our seas would be made extinct by over-fishing and pollution. Growth must be stopped, he urged, &quot;by compulsion if voluntary methods fail&quot;. In 1971, he famously said he would take &quot;even money&quot; on the UK not existing as a state in the year 2000, adding that if it did survive it would be an impoverished island containing 70 million people. Asked about his prediction in 2000, he admitted he would have lost the bet, but added: &quot;If you look closely at England, what can I tell you? They&apos;re having all kinds of problems, just like everybody else.&quot; Ehrlich still stands by many of his predictions, but says that the timings were postponed by innovations that he never anticipated. For example, the so-called &quot;green revolution&quot; in agriculture enabled a much more productive global grain harvest than he ever imagined. Could technological innovations facilitate our continued expansion? &quot;We&apos;re already way past the carrying capacity of this planet by a very simple standard,&quot; he says. &quot;We are not living on the interest from our natural capital \u2013 we are living on the capital itself. The working parts of our life support system are going down the drain at thousands of times the rate that has been the norm over the past millions and millions of\u00a0years.&quot; You cannot view consumption and population growth as separate issues, says Ehrlich: &quot;In one sense, it is the consumption that damages our life support system as opposed to the actual number of people expanding. But both multiply together.&quot; Reducing consumption is a much easier task, though, than tackling population growth, he says: &quot;What many of my colleagues share with me is the view that we would like to see a gradual decline in population, but a rapid decline in consumption habits. We utterly transformed our consumption habits and patterns of economy in the US between 1941 and 1945, and then back again. If you&apos;ve got the right incentives, you can change patterns of consumption very rapidly.&quot; So, if you accept the planet is over populated \u2013 a big &quot;if&quot; for many observers \u2013 what are the solutions? &quot;We have two huge advantages when trying to tackle population growth compared with consumption levels. First, we know what to do about it. If you educate women about their means to control reproduction, the odds are you will see a decline in fertility rates. Second, everyone understands the problem: you can&apos;t keep growing the number of people on a finite\u00a0planet. &quot;But many economists still want people to consume more to get our economy back, but this will just see more resources destroyed. We also don&apos;t have what I&apos;d call &apos;consumption condoms&apos;. One of my colleagues once joked that the government ought to send round a truck to your home the day after you&apos;ve been on a spending spree and offer to take everything you&apos;ve bought back to the store. It would be the equivalent of a consumption morning-after pill.&quot; The seven billion figure is eye-catching, but behind it lies a complicated demographic reality. For example, population growth in developed nations has largely stagnated. Even in places traditionally associated with rapid population growth, such as Bangladesh, birth rates have fallen considerably over the last generation, yet remain well above the natural replenishment rate of just above two children per woman. The only place where birth rates still remain at pre-industrial-age rates \u2013 six or more children per woman \u2013 is sub-Saharan\u00a0Africa. Every region requires its own solution, says Ehrlich. &quot;In the US, where the population has risen by 10% in a decade, largely due to immigration, it is super critical that we tackle the population rise because we are super consumers. But, in general, in the rich countries where population growth has stopped or fallen, we should now be concentrating on reducing per capita consumption levels.&quot;     Projected population growth to 2050    Ehrlich says that he is far more pessimistic now than he was when he wrote The Population Bomb. Increased immigration is an inevitability caused by increasing population and it will, he says, &quot;become an ever-increasing political nightmare&quot;. He also laments the lost opportunities: &quot;The only thing we have done which was beneficial \u2013 but possibly fatal in the long run \u2013 was the &apos;green revolution&apos;. But technological rabbits pulled out of the hat often have very nasty droppings. Frankly, I don&apos;t think most people are even remotely aware of what needs to be done to make our world a pleasant place to live in by, say, 2050.&quot; James Lovelock, the independent scientist who first proposed the Gaia theory, is another prominent environmental thinker who has prescribed a bleak future for the human species if it continues to grow without restriction. He now advises people to &quot;enjoy it while you can&quot; because the outlook for future generations is, he believes, so stark. &quot;We do keep expecting a crash, as Malthus said, but then technology steps in, or something else, and alters the whole game,&quot; he says. &quot;But it has its limit: it doesn&apos;t go to infinity. I expect we&apos;ll muddle through for the next 50 years, but sooner or later it will catch up with us.&quot; Lovelock believes nations such as the UK now resemble a lifeboat: &quot;In the UK, our population is growing slightly. It&apos;s containable. We do grow quite a bit of our food, so we should be OK, provided our climate doesn&apos;t change drastically. We could drop our calorie intake without noticing it in health terms. In fact, we&apos;d improve our health like we did in the second world\u00a0war. &quot;But I think we should call a halt to all immigration, or encourage people to go abroad. The average American has about 10 times as much land as we do. We&apos;re one of the most densely populated places in the world. In some respects, England is one large city. If you want to keep stuffing people in, you&apos;ll have to pay the price. I see us as a lifeboat with the person in charge saying: &apos;We can&apos;t take any more, or else we&apos;ll all sink.&apos; America, meanwhile, could handle lots more immigration. Not politically, perhaps, but in terms of shared resources and land.&quot; Optimism in Istanbul Rotating spotlights illuminate the heavy rain clouds above a former coal-fired power station in the heart of Istanbul. Inside, a DJ ups the pace of the music as new arrivals browse the finger buffet. Business cards are being swapped as a speaker calls for hush. A promotional video begins to play. The Silahtaraga Power Station \u2013 now an energy museum on the campus at Istanbul Bilgi University \u2013 could be the venue for a product launch anywhere in the world. But the crowd of business leaders, media and government officials has gathered for the launch of a report called Future Agenda: The World in 2020. Commissioned by Vodafone, Future Agenda claims to be the world&apos;s largest &quot;open foresight project&quot;: an exercise in future-gazing involving 2,000 global participants, including the British Council, Google, Shell, PepsiCo and academics, with the aim of &quot;analysing the crucial themes of the next 10 years&quot;. But, in contrast to the pessimism offered by Lovelock and Ehrlich, there is a sense of pragmatism, even optimism, about both the opportunities and challenges a rising population will bring. And it&apos;s no accident that Istanbul has been chosen as the launch city. As continental Europe&apos;s only &quot;megacity&quot; \u2013 a population greater than 10 million \u2013 Istanbul believes itself to be an international beacon of how a city can grow both successfully and rapidly. The Economist has reported that Istanbul, with income growth of 5.5% and employment growth of 7.3% over the last year, is currently the world&apos;s &quot;best-performing&quot; city (although credit rating agencies question its status as a borrower). Dr Tim Jones, the British author of Future Agenda, believes that by 2050, 75% of us will be living in cities. &quot;The major trend we need to grasp is rural-urban migration,&quot; he says. &quot;To put it simply, people are largely in the wrong place at the moment. They want to move where they perceive there to be opportunities. This means large cities. Immigration is a difficult political subject at the moment all over the world, but I believe migration will ultimately come to be seen in a positive light as the realisation is finally made that immigrants are a necessity to maintain ageing populations.&quot; Our greatest challenge, says Jones, is to build cities that address the realities of rapid growth: &quot;Sprawl is already being rejected as a deeply inefficient model for growing cities. Hong Kong and Paris are good examples where densities are key to success. They are seen as successful cities. For example, just 5% of Hong Kong&apos;s personal income is spent on transportation whereas in Houston it is 20% because everyone drives such huge distances commuting. Paris, with its six- and seven-storey housing, open spaces and street-based cafe culture is a model to aspire to. The Japanese are also role models when it comes to living densities. We must aspire to be like them. For example, we can&apos;t let China shoot past Japan and attempt to live like the\u00a0Americans.&quot; The gap between the world&apos;s rich and poor will worsen, he says, but that doesn&apos;t mean they will be forced apart geographically. &quot;Residents within the world&apos;s megacities are already realising that they are all interdependent. In Mumbai, the rich want the inner-city slums to remain because they want the cheap labour close by. Equally, when slum dwellers have been given land on the outskirts of the city to tempt them away from the inner-city slums, many people have sold the land and moved back to the slum areas because they are closer to the work.&quot; When it comes to consumption levels, Jones says there are already clear innovations emerging that will help to ease this problem. &quot;The need and desire to actually own something is likely to reduce with rental of goods becoming more and more popular. We&apos;re already seeing this in cities with car [sharing] schemes such as Zipcar.&quot; The rise of the city will also have a huge impact on geopolitics, predicts Jones, with some megacities wielding far more power than many nation states. &quot;Already we are seeing that the C40 [a group of large cities committed to tackling climate change] is having more impact than the G20. I see far more political action being enacted by city mayors in the future.&quot; \u00c7aglar Keyder, a professor of sociology at Istanbul&apos;s Bogazi\u00e7i University, agrees that the citizens of Istanbul are very proud of their city&apos;s rise, but growth has not come without some problems: &quot;There has been rapid urban regeneration; knocking down shanties and putting people in high rises. Retired, older people are moving further out and the young are moving in, but birth rates are falling. Traffic and environmental pollution is where the growth is most felt.&quot; Standard of living Carl Haub has been counting the world&apos;s people for the last three decades. The Conrad Taeuber chair of population information at the Population Reference Bureau in Washington DC and author of the World Population Data Sheet, an internationally respected annual report that provides population, health and environmental indicators for more than 200 countries, he has near-total recall of the myriad figures that underpin 2011&apos;s seven-billion landmark. &quot;In terms of future growth, everything depends on the birth rates in developing nations,&quot; he says. &quot;There is a presumption that the global average will come down to less than two children per woman after 2050, but there are big question marks about this. For example, everyone is pessimistic about sub-Saharan Africa where birth rates overall are not coming down at all. The political situation is key. Both Zimbabwe and Cote d&apos;Ivoire were seen as bright spots by demographers, but now things are much bleaker. Sub-Saharan Africa will double in size by 2050. Nigeria is 158 million now, but will be 326 million by 2050 and will continue rising. Starvation is actually quite rare at the moment in sub-Saharan Africa, but standards of living will continue to fall. And without Aids, there would be 200-300 million more people in Africa by 2050. Many people in the west just don&apos;t understand what the standard of living is like in these countries. Some of the consequences are invisible to us in the west, but for how long?&quot; Migration and ageing are two key, interconnected issues, argues Haub. &quot;China has now got a serious problem with ageing,&quot; he says. &quot;I predict they will relax their one-child policy within five years. In Japan, where ageing is a huge problem, they are now having a major nursing crisis with very few young women wanting to be nurses. They&apos;re having to import them from Vietnam and the Philippines.&quot; City living does help to suppress birth rates, says Haub. This can clearly be seen in Bangladesh, he says, where rural-to-city migration is driven by desperation. Once in the city, the need to have lots of children to work the land disappears, they become expensive to support and access to family planning is readily available. But migration inevitably brings with it political tensions. &quot;Terrorism is the curve ball in the immigration debate. Turks and Slavs were tolerated in Germany for a long period, but not now. The chancellor Angela Merkel recently said that assimilation is not working. The birth rate in Germany is very low \u2013 about 1.4 children per woman, which is close to demographic suicide \u2013 and immigration has maintained the population. In cities such as Frankfurt, where there is a very sizeable Turkish population, there is now a fear of radicalism amid isolated communities. And then there is religion, of course. But, in general, I see this as a decreasing influence when it comes to family planning. In Africa, for example, cultural norms have a much greater impact. Here we see issues such as polygamy and men boasting about how many children they have.&quot; So are there any signs of optimism? &quot;We have to be realistic,&quot; he says. &quot;We are just not going to see fewer people on the planet in the near future. But there are some developing countries where the birth rate is under control. Thailand is seen as the No\u00a01 developing country when it comes to family planning. The birth rate there is 1.8. Indonesia also has a very efficient family-planning system. &quot;But how far do you go? South Korea has a birth rate of 1.2 and in Taiwan it is 1.0. It is the lowest in the world and means the country is literally dying. If you do want a reduced birth rate, then well organised family planning campaigns are much more important than economic growth. It might be unfashionable to say so, but international aid acts as a catalyst for this. Monetary assistance is key at the beginning to get these campaigns\u00a0going.&quot; Haub is already thinking ahead to the eighth billion person being born sometime around 2025. &quot;The 20th century saw many things happen that greatly helped to reduce the death rate, such as public-health campaigns, immunisation and provision of clean water. The challenge for the 21st\u00a0century is different: it&apos;s all about managing birth rates.&quot; \u2022 Future Agenda paid Leo Hickman&apos;s travel expenses to attend its event in\u00a0Istanbul."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cardiff/2011/jan/14/butetown-coal-exhange-soul-exhange-national-theatre-wales", "publicationDate": "2011-01-14T14:35:01Z", "tags": ["Butetown"], "sentences": ["My mother had four half-siblings whose father was from Formosa (Taiwan)."], "title": "Butetown stories: Becoming unstuck from the gramophone groove", "article": "The story of Cardiff&apos;s rise (and fall) as &quot;the biggest and most prosperous coal port in the world&quot; - including the now legendary \u00a31m Coal Exchange deal - is well known and continuously commemorated throughout the layers of regeneration in the area. The streets and office blocks still carry names invoking the people and places of these stories, from Aberdare to the Baltic. For most, the link between this community&apos;s diversity and Cardiff&apos;s maritime heritage seems straightforward enough and perhaps something to be celebrated: but there are also less pronounced, more profound matters to consider. Crucially, prevailing attitudes (and legislation) of the day dictated that &apos;alien coloured seamen&apos; would only be employed handling &apos;dirty&apos; cargo \u2013 such as coal. So Cardiff was not really a destination of choice for anyone. Compounding this, naked racism following the First World War literally forced these &apos;coloured&apos; seamen and their families to remain within the boundaries that defined the area for generations to come. I was born in Butetown in 1957, and have lived here ever since. My own immediate family history includes migrants from Barbados, Philippines, Norway and England \u2013 as well as &apos;genuine&apos; Welsh ancestry. My mother had four half-siblings whose father was from Formosa (Taiwan). Through marriages (and co-habitation) I had uncles and in-laws from Ireland, Somalia, Egypt, Jamaica and the US. None of this was particularly remarkable when I was younger: childhood friends had parents and grandparents from India (later to become Pakistan and Bangladesh) the Yemen, Sudan, Spain, Poland, Malta, Italy \u2026 and of course many of these children had &apos;mixed&apos; heritage just like me, and &apos;mixed&apos; names like Steven Mohamed or Samantha Wickramsinghe wouldn&apos;t raise an eyebrow. Butetown tells a thousand stories, but for some of us, familiarity with those stories have begun to breed a bit of contempt. Not for the history and certainly not for the elders and generations before, but because it seems to have become stuck in a groove like an old gramophone. It may be cute, even fascinating - but unlistenable for any length of time. More tellingly, this consistent looping of misty memories has served in some ways to undermine and debase the community, and continues to do so today. Clearly I&apos;m biased, but I would have to say that the 1970s and 80s was a dynamic era right here and across the world. But there is scarcely any reference to this period in the telling and retelling our history here in Butetown. It&apos;s as if the area jumped from canals and cobblestones to a decrepit carbuncle in swish Cardiff Bay with no other evolutionary stages in between. Music was a driving force for me back then. I remember vividly walking through the streets and hearing something different every other or house, before the days of mega hi-fi. It was just pleasant strains of jazz, soul, calypso, blue beat \u2013 even a bit of classical every now and then. The nightclubs, the carnival, jamming on the park, sound systems on street corners - whatever perceptions or prejudices might abound about the area, Butetown&apos;s status as\u00a0the\u00a0place for music and nightlife was consolidated throughout this period. My first encounter with The Soul Exchange was at Butetown History and Arts Centre. I knew it would be a show about Butetown, and I thought &quot;here we go again, same old stories.&quot; But this show doesn&apos;t tell my story \u2013 it&apos;s the story of the central character, John, who travels through Butetown meeting real characters along the way. That he gets to meet so many people and hear so many stories in such a short visit is of course due to the skill of the writers and the director, but it&apos;s also a true reflection of the area \u2013 Butetown is like that.

I was there to survey the archaeology. With colonial guidebooks from the 1930s, a rundown Land Rover (which had been a mobile cinema until the equipment broke down) and an 1899 map, I hunted out ruined cities, ancient mosques and Arabian palaces.

We stepped out of the helicopter with our six-year-old daughter and 11-month-old son: no accommodation, cafes, bars, shops or doctors. Our clapboard house had a mattress, a Calor Gas heater and a freezer full of reindeer legs. We stocked up on tins and seal meat. No fresh food: in this barren landscape nothing grows. The world&apos;s largest island has fewer than 60,000 inhabitants. Howling dogs and 24-hour daylight keep sleep in short supply. At night, we&apos;d stand on the beach watching hunters bring in their catch, while whales spouted 100m off the black strand. I was mesmerised by the icebergs, some as big as tower blocks, that danced in the bay, changing colour as the sun bounced off the horizon. Over the past 18 months, we&apos;ve been charting the villagers&apos; lives. Niaqornat is changing. In spring, the receding glacier scars the ground. Hunting quotas harm livelihoods. If the population falls below 50, the government talks of relocating them to a city. And Lars, the lone teenager, who&apos;s never been more than a few miles from home, is constantly on Facebook chatting to 200 friends across the globe. Trying to capture this change in all its complexity inspires me.Sarah Gavron directed Brick Lane and is now working on Edge of the World, a documentary about Greenland  \u2022 Discover the World (01737 214250, discover-the-world.co.uk) has four nights in west Greenland, at the Hotel Arctic in Ilulissat, from \u00a31,553pp, including flights from Reykjavik but not from the UK Serbia, Sophie Cooke  I was invited to a short story festival in Serbia in 2009. The car pulled through the Belgrade traffic past dirty concrete apartment blocks, prostitutes in tight red tops working the roundabouts. So far, so post-communist. Then we crossed the river and sped up a cobbled hill, past baroque courtyards, Orthodox churches, crowds of students. Here was a city whose old heart was still splendid. This is a country that has drastically changed its identity three times in the space of a single human lifetime. It fought the Nazis, yet ended up as the bogeyman of Europe. It went from communism, and a national motto of &quot;brotherhood and unity&quot;, to tearing itself apart in the civil war of the 1990s. Then it accelerated into an extreme form of capitalism. Belgrade&apos;s uber-rich dress in Versace \u2013 yet average salaries are tiny and there is no social security. I was sitting in a cafe when it dawned on me. The character for whom I had been unable to find a home belonged here. Finally she, and my third novel, acquired a name \u2013 Dragana Savic \u2013 and her story is also the story of Belgrade. I went back last year. By then I had friends in the city. We ate from grill stands and smoked in secret bars. We watched a Gogol play in a car museum, and danced in nightclubs under the bridges. We talked books in a biker bar. Belgrade inspired my novel, but it is inspirational in a more general sense: it is filled with kind and witty people, wise beyond their years, who always impress and energise.Sophie Cooke is a novelist, poet, short-story writer and photographer \u2022 Regent Holidays (0845 277 3317, regent-holidays.co.uk) has three nights in Belgrade in a three-star hotel from \u00a3355pp, including flights China, Susan Stockwell China shook me up and was very exciting because I could feel the rapid rate of change happening in front of my eyes, as if life were speeded up. It was infectious: I felt extra energy and could harness that for my work, gaining insights into a future world that may overtake the old world I come from. I found people&apos;s resourcefulness, reusing everything time and again, saving fuel and living off little, life-affirming. I made some seminal pieces in China and Taiwan, and since.

Photograph: Alamy    Ribblehead viaduct is beautiful and majestic. It was built to shorten the journey time from London to Glasgow on the Midland Railway. As a child, I was taken to witness its greatness by my father. My dad was a landscape painter and made several studies of it, which I cherish. For me, this kind of structure will always have more authority in the landscape than works of public art. This summer I took my wife and kids and camped just above Hawes on the Pennine Way. We visited the viaduct and walked up to the entrance to Blea Moor tunnel and thought about the men who died building this structure.

The route took two days and was an integral part of the experience: a series of trains, ferries and a touring bicycle carrying panniers stuffed with notebooks, clothes and tins of beans. Two trains, two ferries and 75 miles of challenging cycling later, an unmarked track led to Cabhalan Cottage. It overlooks a coastal inlet and has no neighbouring houses or nearby road. Being cocooned within the cottage&apos;s four-foot-thick walls provided the ultimate haven for reflection without distraction. The solitude became dangerously addictive. Harris is the personification of Mother Nature: the golden eagle that regularly took flight just feet from the front door, the deafening silence at the foot of M\u00e0s Garbh, and the infinitude of the golden beach at Losgaintir. A sense of privilege, heartfelt respect and almost penitence for being human manifested themselves throughout the two weeks I spent there. Harris is a very special place and the memory of it continues to be a source of clarity, insight and humility.Matthew Bourne is an award-winning pianist and composer.

Not so with Trinidad. I first went just after I was born, and have visited almost every year since. For a time I lived in south Trinidad; years scattered here and there at various points of crises. It was a place to heal, to recover. Trinidad has pulled stories right out of my heart. My first novel came from tales I heard as a child. What is it about this island? There are the rising hills at the back of my mother&apos;s house, the Northern Range, and the gold afternoon light burning through the leaves; the coarse grass underfoot, gigantic red ants, the shaggy heads of mango trees. There is the familiar song of Kiskadee birds; green parrots squabbling in the yard. And of course, the terrific heat that makes you want to fall to the ground. It is far from paradise. Just last night there was black smoke on the highway, and when we got close there were orange flames leaping high. I&apos;m going to write about this, I thought. But I had seen fires before \u2013 why was this so different? And then it came to me: there were no fire engines speeding through the traffic. This fire was burning freely, left to rage against the dark blue sky. And yet, later, somewhere in Port of Spain, we caught the tinkly rolling song of pan-playing in a dark back street and I was awed. The truth is this: Trinidad is a place where writers, musicians and artists are bursting through this beauty and darkness. A hot little melting pot of activity, Trinidad is alive!Amanda Smyth is the author of Black Rock (Serpent&apos;s Tail, \u00a37.99) \u2022 British Airways (ba.com) flies Gatwick to Port of Spain from \u00a3555 including taxes Massachusetts, Sarah Thomas The Pioneer Valley in western Massachusetts is cut through by the Connecticut River, in which one of my ancestors drowned in the 18th century. In the autumn, the maple trees flame red and orange, and the oak leaves bronze. Northampton, Massachusetts, home of Smith College, is a small city that grew up along the banks of the Connecticut. Nonotuck, its Indian name, means &quot;the midst of the river&quot;. In 1871, Miss Sophia Smith endowed a college for women, and it has flourished ever since. Its campus, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the architect of New York&apos;s Central Park, is a tree-shaded refuge. Smith educated the wives and daughters of presidents (Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Julie Nixon Eisenhower) and sent young women out confidently into the world to become politicians and teachers. It was at Smith that I began the journey that led me to the Bodleian Library \u2013 I am the first woman to lead the organisation since it opened 400 years ago. A chance job pasting bookplates in the library of Margaret Sanger, the early 20th-century advocate of birth control, became the first in a series of positions in great libraries. The Pioneer Valley is not only fertile farmland, but also an inspirational place for women, and a rich cultural environment for printers and others working in the book arts.Sarah Thomas is director of the Bodleian Libraries, Oxford \u2022 Virgin Atlantic (virgin-atlantic.com) flies Heathrow to Boston from \u00a3342 including taxes Turkey, Elif Safak One of my favourite places in Turkey is Cappadocia, known for its fairy chimney rock formations and cave hotels. A hot-air balloon lets you see the breathtaking moonscape from above. The first time I did this, I resisted. Grumpy and cranky, I woke early and let my friends drag me into this valley. Hot-air balloons of all colours were being filled with air. There was a strange silence, as if everyone felt the need to stop talking and start looking within. Then we began to ascend. As the sun rose, streaks of fiery red turned azure. The caves below resembled polished prehistoric eggs. The air was crisp and we could smell wild herbs wafting in the wind from the mountains. In a balloon you cannot change lanes, swerving left and right as you wish; you move up and down with the current, much like in life. I have been back, but the first time remains unforgettable. The place and its balloons helped me to rethink the notion of &quot;peaceful surrender&quot;, which played a central role in my latest novel, The Forty Rules of Love. I believe Cappadocia&apos;s modesty, serenity and uniqueness will speak to your heart.Elif Shafak is a novelist and Turkey&apos;s biggest-selling female author \u2022 Exodus (0845 287 3680, exodus.co.uk) has an 11-day Cappadocia and the Taurus Mountains trek from \u00a31,049pp, with basic hotel accommodation and camping, and including flights The Lake District, Robert Rowland Smith The best walk I ever did was by Wastwater in the Lake District, and the experience began long before I got there. The very name clinched it: I loved the desolate melancholy it evoked. The place married beauty with bleakness, or something darker. Small wonder that not far from here Wordsworth conceived his concept of the sublime, a coming together of the exquisite and the terrifying. Wasdale forces you to connect not only with the outer landscape, but with your inner self. You may be getting back to nature, but you&apos;re also being tugged within, to places not often visited \u2013 buried memories, hopes and fears, milestones passed. Where Buttermere pleases the eye and gives a sense of pastoral wellbeing, and Windermere offers itself up like a playground, the water here remains inscrutable, and keeps putting the question back to you, like a mirror. The fact it&apos;s the deepest lake makes it less, not more penetrable. Then there&apos;s the ring of mountains: they serve to make the valley feel all the more hidden. When you&apos;re down on the flatlands, you could be in the safety of a child&apos;s farmyard set, so penned in and miniature does it seem.

Our walk in the High Atlas lasted only four days but with each passing day, those hills engulfed us further into the kind of natural embrace that makes you forget where you&apos;re from.The bus from Marrakech dropped us off in Asni, an unremarkable village at the foot of Mount Toubkal, teeming with crooks masquerading as mountain guides. One of them, Brahim, took our money and went to buy supplies. He invited us to wait in his house with his wife and five daughters and after several hours, returned fall-down drunk, carrying two plastic bags containing the following provisions: a tin of sardines, a box of laughing cow cheese, five tomatoes, some almonds and a pot of honey.He told us he was feeling unwell and that his cousin, Mohammed, would be our guide instead. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Mohammed was fitter, sunnier and more popular than Brahim, a quality that would prove invaluable on our trek. For with no money and our pathetic supplies, he had to cadge our bed and board from friends and relatives along our route.

Book by 25 January  Nigeria, Lola Shoneyin Last year, during a brief visit to Calabar, Nigeria, my host took me on a boat ride downriver. We set off mid-morning and sliced through the murky waters of the Cross River. On both sides, the river bank was crowded with palm trees that leaned in on the water as if their fronds were simultaneously fascinated and fearful of the deep, as I was.After about 40 minutes, we moored at the jetty of a quaint little town called Oron, which used to serve as a ferry terminal in the colonial days when roads shared their burden with the great rivers. It was like walking into the past.Wooden louvres favoured by colonial architects hung still from the windows. Clear inscriptions, from over 50 years ago, had resisted the warm winds that skim the tide and whirl around the old post office, the stopover inns and hotels (many of which are now brothels), the shacks and small bungalows on both sides of the narrow roads, and the pale yellow museum. In front of the museum, standing on a pedestal was the stone statue of a venerable colonial curator, complete with khaki trousers, thick-rimmed glasses and a safari hat.At a certain point during my meander through the town, I could now feel what was missing from a story I&apos;d given up on when I couldn&apos;t make the connection between the Nigeria I was familiar with and the Nigeria that primitively hounded children and labelled them child witches. I was suddenly struck by the primitiveness of my surroundings, as if this town had stubbornly decided to stay mired in the past. Although this wasn&apos;t entirely the case in Oron, I suddenly understood how it was possible for the collective spirit of a people to remain anchored to a darker age, despite substantial exposure to the inevitable tide of newness.Before leaving, we stopped by a shack on the river bed and tucked into bowls of fresh fish pepper soup. Watching the fishermen pulling their dug-outs ashore, my story came alive again.Lola Shoneyin is an author and poet.

I used to imagine that if you did the fringe long enough, you would graduate to the festival proper, but no. The whole city buzzes at that time of year, the population doubles, and the air is filled with a tingling excitement. This can drive you nuts, so it&apos;s good to be able to get away from it. Fortunately the city provides for this by having a huge mountain, called Arthur&apos;s Seat, installed in the middle. It must have taken ages to build, for from its summit you can see the entire city and the Firth of the Forth beyond, on those rare days when it&apos;s not raining. I lost my virginity up there, and every year go back to look for it. Looking down on the tiny cars whizzing about allows me to imagine I&apos;m a deity and on this conceit I based a character I used to do called the League Against Tedium; somewhere there&apos;s a photograph of me standing on the peak with a whip trying to lash the sky into obedience.

About time too | Tanya Gold", "article": "There was a fight in the Palace of Westminster this week. It was a small fight, and nothing to ruffle the International League Table of Legislator Physical Violence, where first place is still held by Taiwan, because the opposition and ruling party frequently beat each other and sometimes throw food. Still, this fight was non-violent, instructive and very British. Mark Pritchard, a Tory MP described &quot;as mild mannered&quot; in the way that serial killers are usually described as mild-mannered until the lampshades made of skin are found in the basement, apparently impeded the movement of Speaker Bercow, who was progressing through the palace like a small medieval king mounted on a skateboard. &quot;The courtesy of the house is that honourable members should stand aside when the Speaker passes by,&quot; said Bercow, whose rudeness to his former Tory colleagues is marvellous. He even pointed at Pritchard, to emphasise that he was not talking to a random ornamental vase. And so Pritchard, still recovering from an earlier slight in the chamber when the Speaker had not called him, believing Pritchard had been in the toilet or something, freaked. &quot;You are not fucking royalty, Mr Speaker,&quot; he said. Mr Speaker didn&apos;t comment on this, probably because he is married to Sally. &quot;Well, a good morning to you, Sir,&quot; he said instead, and skated off, leaving Pritchard to brief the newspapers, and comment: &quot;When someone abuses me in this house they are abusing my constituents.&quot; Yes, I am sure that is exactly what was in your mind. You were thinking of the poor folk of The Wrekin. You should go down there and mobilise the pitchforks. I bet they want to put Bercow&apos;s head on a spike and toast each other noisily with ale. The first lesson is that it would probably be best not to have a legislature whose central practices resemble Cinderella inexplicably transformed into a system of government. Burn the stupid costumes; let Black Rod walk forwards, not backwards; and allow the politicians to call each other liars in public, because they long to, and we long for them to do so. Perhaps we could even abolish the word &quot;Sir&quot;, because it means &quot;You bastard&quot;, and now everyone knows, rather than strongly suspects, that it does? These few acknowledgments that we may be living in a modern liberal democracy might make British people feel that parliament actually has something to do with them. The next lesson is that public charm is fraying, and it is time that it did. Despite his courtly language \u2013 which should, and indeed might have, come with a free packet of gently fluttering rose petals \u2013 Bercow could not be bothered to be charming to Pritchard: &quot;Prithee, Sir, I beg you to stand aside, for your enormous feet \u2013 and how wondrous it is that feet of such size should exist in this or any other palace \u2013 may stand on my robe and tear the hem of this lush garment, which should cause me such agonies I would beat my breast and weep for a thousand years.&quot; Pritchard could not be bothered to be charming to Bercow: &quot;Why Sir, you had only to ask, for should I tear your pretty hem, even in error, I would weep for a thousand and one years and never duel again.&quot; This did not happen. I welcome this shrivelling of charm, because charm is a bad thing in public discourse, the verbal equivalent of licking someone while stabbing them in the tongue. Consider David Cameron, possibly the most skilled charmer to ever stand at a dispatch box and lie. I do not say this to compliment him, although he would probably take it as such. Now they can no longer hang poachers and wave their sabres, charm is the weapon of choice of the English aristocrat. They switch it on and off, like the kettle. And I mistrust it. It is the practice of taking everything, while appearing not to, because you make self-deprecating jokes and smile, and are photographed jogging \u2013 see how I suffer! It is the opposite of conversation, a subtle, evasive and malevolent form of lying. And, as Polly Toynbee demonstrated on these pages recently, Cameron is possibly the most skilled liar to ever stand at the dispatch box and charm. The rightwing papers may swallow it \u2013 charmers don&apos;t make gaffes that fill pages \u2013 but the voters, it seems, don&apos;t. What is charm when your public services wither and you know that they do? Cameron was punched at Oldham East and Saddleworth, even if he charmingly said he didn&apos;t mind. He will live by charm, and he will die by it. And what is left, the internet will eat. Charm needs a face and there are no faces online. Twitter, while blunt and shrieking and full of people who use words like Twitter Consensus and talk about pizza, has already demonstrated that it is no longer possible to survive casual homophobia (Jan Moir) or, this week, taunting anorexics (Kenneth Tong). It will outlaw other outrageous behaviour and give us a more honest public discourse in time. And, while we wait, we have Speaker Bercow&apos;s impersonation of the late Queen Mother to entertain us."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jan/17/tv-review-gordon-ramsay-shark-bait", "publicationDate": "2011-01-17T08:00:02Z", "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture", "Gordon Ramsay", "Chefs", "Life and style", "Documentary", "Drama"], "sentences": ["Then he jets off to Taiwan and finds supermarkets full of dried sharks&apos; fins.", "I suppose it is just possible that the man didn&apos;t understand the question, English not being the principal language of Taiwan.", "Gordon, impressively, does actually seem to be able to read the Han script, and successfully identifies a restaurant by its sign, but his spoken Taiwanese is less good."], "title": "TV review: Gordon Ramsay \u2013 Shark Bait; Wild at Heart; Zen", "article": "Gordon Ramsay is at the aquarium. &quot;There&apos;s only one fish I&apos;m obsessed about, and it&apos;s in there,&quot; he says, staring enigmatically into the depths. Is it the clown fish, Gordon? Oh, the shark, is it? &quot;They&apos;re individuals,&quot; he explains. &quot;They don&apos;t swim in masses, they are unique individuals that stand out.&quot; He identifies with them, respect from one apex predator to another. His youngest daughter, Matilda, loves them too, he says. Her bedroom is just sharks, everywhere \u2013 duvet, pillow, teddies (teddy sharks?). She wants to go with daddy, diving with sharks. Not yet, she&apos;s too young, but one day \u2013 &quot;if I come back,&quot; adds Gordon, emphasising the enormous danger he&apos;s putting himself in to make this film. Actually, the format of Gordon Ramsay: Shark Bait (Channel 4, Sunday) isn&apos;t quite as exciting as the title suggests. Sadly, he&apos;s not impaled on a giant hook, wriggling like a maggot, and lowered into the ocean. Instead, he goes around making a nuisance of himself, pretending to be an investigative journalist. So he barges into a few restaurants in London&apos;s Chinatown, rifles through the cupboards behind the counter of a supermarket (I&apos;d like to see a camera crew try that at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay). Then he jets off to Taiwan and finds supermarkets full of dried sharks&apos; fins. &quot;What kind of shark is that?&quot; he asks, picking up a big fin. &quot;Fish,&quot; says the man. &quot;Fish!&quot; snorts Gordon. Pah, the ignorance of these people. I suppose it is just possible that the man didn&apos;t understand the question, English not being the principal language of Taiwan. Gordon, impressively, does actually seem to be able to read the Han script, and successfully identifies a restaurant by its sign, but his spoken Taiwanese is less good. A translator may have been a good idea. There are more communication problems down at the port: no one really wants to talk to Gordon. He shouts at some poor security guard who probably isn&apos;t directly responsible for the trade, then stumbles on a baby hammerhead in the back of a truck. And wandering the backstreets, &quot;not too sure what I&apos;m looking for&quot; (are you sure about that, Gordon?), suddenly he looks up, and the sky is full of shark fins, drying on the roofs. A dog barks, as dogs do. &quot;Now they&apos;ve got the fucking dogs out,&quot; says Gordon, reverting to what he does best. A Mercedes drives past. &quot;Dodgy black car, blacked-out windows, fucking hell,&quot; he says. Without doubt a big-time gangster, or possibly a business man on his way home. But Gordon&apos;s fearless investigation isn&apos;t going to be thwarted. He finds his way up to one of the drying roofs, and a woman makes a phone call. &quot;She just called someone on the telephone, let&apos;s get the fuck out of here,&quot; says Gordon. &quot;Let&apos;s get out of here before we get shot.&quot; I think he does actually think he is Jason Bourne. It is a horrid business, especially the outlawed but still common practice known as &quot;finning&quot; \u2013 cutting off a shark&apos;s fins while it&apos;s still alive, then throwing it back into the sea to die. The numbers are shocking \u2013 70 million sharks slaughtered every year (and all for shark&apos;s fin soup, a dish that Ramsay doesn&apos;t rate). But it&apos;s not just about cruelty, it&apos;s about upsetting delicate eco systems too. The subject is a really important one; I&apos;m just not convinced they&apos;ve got the right person to take it on. You do the cooking, Gordon, and the swearing and the celebrity stuff. Leave the investigative journalism to investigative journalists. You wouldn&apos;t want Roger Cook pan-frying your scallops, would you?

I think China will do more [this time],&quot; said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University, Beijing. &quot;Our leaders need it because the diplomatic performance last year was quite bad. They want to reassure the American public.&quot; Last year was \u2013 according to David Shambaugh, a veteran watcher of bilateral relations \u2013 the most strained for a decade. That was all the more striking because some thought President Barack Obama&apos;s visit to Beijing in 2009 was unexpectedly productive. The joint statement they produced was &quot;a visionary road map for building the relationship on bilateral, regional, and global levels \u2026 Unfortunately, much of [it] was stillborn&quot;, Shambaugh wrote this week. The two sides have been frank in acknowledging their differences. &quot;When the relationship is strained we need to bear in mind the larger picture and not allow any individual issue to disrupt our overall co-operation,&quot; vice foreign minister Cui Tiankai said on Friday. &quot;Both sides feel strongly it&apos;s time to stabilise relations and reduce tensions and deal with the situation on the peninsula,&quot; said Shi. &quot;I think compared with last year&apos;s situation, it will be quite easy to achieve some sort of success.&quot; While they are highly unlikely to agree on how to handle North Korea \u2013 Beijing wants a return to the six-party talks but Washington says Pyongyang must not be rewarded for bad behaviour \u2013 they may find a way to imply progress. On trade, Beijing has allowed its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate over the last year \u2013 albeit not at anything like the rate many in the US want \u2013 and it is expected to rise further this year. The underlying, structural disagreements are another matter. While there is room for co-operation as well as competition on trade and nonproliferation efforts, human rights and territorial disagreements are largely intractable, suggested Professor Shen Dingli, director of the Centre for American Studies at Fudan University. But China mishandled disputes over arms sales to Taiwan, Obama&apos;s meeting with the Dalai Lama and the South China Seas, he said, by taking such a blunt approach: &quot;It created unnecessary confrontation.&quot; This year, it is sending out friendlier signals \u2013 Shen points out it did not accept its ally Iran&apos;s invitation to visit its nuclear facilities. But while the Chinese military invited US defence secretary Robert Gates to tour its nuclear warfare headquarters last week, it also held the first, unannounced test flight of its new stealth fighter during his visit. Meanwhile Gates had warm words for Beijing, but subsequently raised questions about a possible &quot;disconnect&quot; between the military and civilian leadership."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jan/17/china-hu-jintao-obama-summit", "publicationDate": "2011-01-17T22:00:02Z", "tags": ["Hu Jintao", "China", "US news", "Barack Obama", "US national security", "US foreign policy", "Obama administration", "US politics", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Specific issues \u2013 Beijing&apos;s supposed unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft, US arms sales to Taiwan and South China Sea security disputes, the attempted gagging of Google, and the continued detention of the Nobel peace prizewinner Liu Xiaobo \u2013 raised the bilateral temperature, sometimes to boiling point."], "title": "China's too big to be bullied by the US | Simon Tisdall", "article": "White House talks between Barack Obama and China&apos;s president, Hu Jintao, which begin on Tuesday night, are not just any old summit. The former US national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski summed up the mood, describing the meeting as &quot;the most important top-level US-China encounter since Deng Xiaoping&apos;s historic trip more than 30 years ago&quot;. As some in China and the US see it, the choice boils down to one of future war or peace. Historically speaking, empires always fight. Successive American administrations have struggled to define the relationship between the world&apos;s leading superpower and the rising star of Asia that threatens to supplant it. Past summits often produced little of substance. Now, facing critical public, congressional and business scrutiny, Obama is under pressure to stand up for US interests and obtain tangible results. The past year brought a series of public clashes, reinforcing a growing US belief that China was swapping its designated role as strategic partner for that of strategic rival. Specific issues \u2013 Beijing&apos;s supposed unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft, US arms sales to Taiwan and South China Sea security disputes, the attempted gagging of Google, and the continued detention of the Nobel peace prizewinner Liu Xiaobo \u2013 raised the bilateral temperature, sometimes to boiling point. Some rightwing commentators claim the US and China are already at war, if not yet in the conventional sense, and accuse Obama of naivety. Through currency manipulation, commercial attrition and expanding overseas investment, Hu is pursuing &quot;war by other means&quot;, said Irwin Stelzer in the Weekly Standard, adding: &quot;The communist regime sees trade policy as merely one strategic weapon in a war aimed at overtaking the US as the world&apos;s pre-eminent economic and military power.&quot; He cited the boast of China&apos;s defence minister, General Liang Guanglie, that &quot;in the next five years our military will push forward preparations for military conflicts in every strategic direction&quot;. While firmly rejecting war analogies, the White House knows it has a fight on its hands on many fronts \u2013 economic, political, ideological. Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, said last week that relations had reached a crucial juncture: &quot;It is up to both nations to translate the high-level pledges of summits and state visits into action. Real action, on real issues.&quot; Tim Geithner, the treasury secretary, Robert Gates at defence and Obama himself have all joined Clinton in setting out what the US expects from China. Their shopping list includes fuller co-operation on nuclear proliferation and climate change, stronger Chinese support on specific problems such as Iran and North Korea, and a more &quot;responsible&quot; exchange rate policy. White House aides say Obama also plans to publicly step up pressure on human rights. Obama met leading US-based Chinese human rights advocates last week, discussing how best to influence attitudes from within. According to the Washington Post, Obama recalled his childhood in Indonesia, then governed by a dictatorship. &quot;One thing he kept coming back to was \u2013 how does the omnipresence of the state, how does corruption, affect the lives of real people?&quot; one official said. &quot;And he asked how we should use our leverage \u2026 There was a lot of talk about how to reach into China to be heard.&quot; The problem with America&apos;s exhortatory approach to human rights and other issues is that it rarely works. Clinton admitted that Beijing resented such interventions as an infringement of sovereignty. And trying to spread the civil liberties message Iran-style, behind the Communist party&apos;s back, is hazardous. It may only compound the problem, hurting those Obama seeks to help. China has its hardliners, too. They would undoubtedly exploit such action to weaken Hu and the party&apos;s reform wing. This unpalatable reality reflects a bigger truth: the US must stop trying to tell China what to do. The time for that has passed. China is too big to be bullied, too canny to be conned, too complicated to be changed from without. And it cannot sensibly be blamed for America&apos;s declining global clout. Some self-awareness, a focus on practical, mutually beneficial measures, and a little circumspection would ultimately work better to stop a war of words turning into something worse. That&apos;s not to say human rights abuses can be ignored. But grandstanding will not help. Hu wants a successful summit. He retires next year \u2013 and is enough of a politician to want to assure his legacy. But he&apos;s not going to roll over. Before getting on the plane, he warned Obama to tread carefully or risk deepening estrangement. &quot;We both stand to gain from a sound China-US relationship, and lose from confrontation,&quot; Hu said. The two countries should &quot;respect each other&apos;s choice of development path&quot;. This summit marks a strategic turning point. Hu&apos;s constituency is the Communist party, the People&apos;s Liberation Army, and an increasingly nationalistic Chinese public.

About 200 active and retired Turkish military officers, including former chiefs of the air force and dozens of generals and admirals, went on trial in December on charges of &quot;attempting to topple the government by force&quot; as part of a plot dubbed Sledgehammer. Turkey&apos;s military, which has overthrown three governments since 1960 and put pressure on an Islamist-led government to step down in 1997, has denied such a plot existed.

It has a story today that US ambassador to Nato, Ivo Daalder, warned that Finnish membership of the military alliance would not be well recieved by Russia. Here is a link to a Google translation.  12.30pm: More You ask, we search. Ben Quinn has a story on one US embassy and its Facebook page: The US embassy in Jakarta made a request for $100,000 in funding to boost its Facebook fans to one million weeks before Barack Obama&apos;s visit to Indonesia. A cable sent in February by US diplomats in the Indonesian capital described itself as &quot;already the leading US Mission in the World on Facebook with nearly 50,000 &apos;fans&apos;, and one of the leading missions using Twitter, YouTube and engaging local bloggers to promote USG [US government] messages and information.&quot; &quot;We are uniquely positioned to use these tools to amplify key topics and themes to support the upcoming visit by President Obama,&quot; it added. The embassy described itself in the cable as &quot;on the forefront of Public Diplomacy 2.0.&quot; Requesting the $100,0000, the cable said that the embassy could boost its Facebook fan page membership to one million in 30 days in a country it described as one of the fastest-growing Facebook markets in the world. But it is unclear if it reached the target \u2013\u00a0with or without the money. By April last year, the total number of Facebook fans of the US Embassies and consulates in Indonesia was 161,000, according to an interview given by the embassy team behind the page.  The cable set out how the money was to be spent, including increasing advertising on Indonesian online portals and elsewhere, as well as generating interest in the presidential visit by offering Facebook users the chance to win a &quot;golden ticket&quot; to meet Obama:  If the White House approves, we could invite fans to post why they should meet President Obama, and in doing so, use our social media platform to connect fans to the visit, as well as build excitement beforehand and follow-up coverage afterwards  The embassy&apos;s suggestion that it should also team up with a television show subsequently came to fruition. On a national television show, three Facebook fans of the Jakarta embassy won &quot;educational trips&quot; to the US to visit places that were said to have played a part in Obama&apos;s life \u2013 this was the embassy&apos;s suggested alternative prize if the White House did not give its blessing to meetings with Obama for competition winners.  12.15pm: Aftenposten, the Norwegian newspaper, has a story looking at the US belief that what it saw as weaknesses in China&apos;s export controls that could make it easier for countries that had an illicit nuclear weapons programme to get some of the necessary parts. In Norwegian that&apos;s Kina lekker til Iran som en sil or, via Google Translate, China to Iran leaking like a sieve.  From a 2008 cable published by Aftenposten:  China in recent years has taken some positive steps to curb ballistic missile-related proliferation, and we have seen some limited improvements continue over the past year, particularly in regard to sales by some state-owned enterprises to Iran. Despite indicators that Chinese authorities are gradually adopting more responsible export control policies, Chinese firms over the past year have sold ballistic missile-related items - mostly metals and other raw materials - to Iran, Pakistan, and to a lesser extent, North Korea, and marketed sub-MTCR-class ballistic missile systems and technology to a growing range of customers. Such activities are indicative of Chinas uneven track record in enforcing its missile-related export controls.  Cables published by the paper also show US diplomats monitoring exports to Iran from many more countries, including Taiwan and South Africa.  11.15am: The CEO of Germany&apos;s leading satellite manufacturer has lost his job following further revelations from the cables.  Berry Smutny, CEO of OHB-Technology, first appeared on this blog on 5 January for saying, according to US diplomats, that France was &quot;the evil empire stealing technology and Germany knows this&quot;. But that&apos;s not, at least directly, why he was fired. There was a second cable release in which he described the European satellite project Galileo as &quot;a stupid idea that primarily served French interests&quot;.  It may help to add here that OHB-Technology, which until yesterday Smutny headed, is one of the companies working on it.  10.25am: Good morning. Stories from the cables today: \u2022 Turkey let US use airbase for rendition flights  Turkey allowed the US to use its airbase at Incirlik in southern Turkey as part of the &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; programme to take suspected terrorists to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, according to a US diplomatic cable. Turkey&apos;s involvement in the controversial programme was revealed in a cable dated 8 June 2006, written by the then US ambassador to Turkey, Ross Wilson. The cable described Turkey as a crucial ally in the &quot;global war on terror&quot; and an important logistical base for the US-led war in Iraq. &quot;The Turkish military had allowed us to use Incirlik as a refuelling stop for Operation Fundamental Justice detainee movement operations since 2002, but revoked this permission in February of this year. We understand OSD [office of the secretary of defence] and JCS [joint chiefs of staff] have been discussing whether to approach Turkey to seek to reverse this decision,&quot; the cable said  \u2022 &apos;Baby Doc&apos; Duvalier&apos;s possible return to Haiti concerned US  The US expressed its concern about the possible return of Jean-Claude &quot;Baby Doc&quot; Duvalier to Haiti as far back as 2006, when the country was about to hold elections, according to a confidential US diplomatic cable. Five years on, US fears have materialised with the shock return of the former dictator last night. Duvalier, who was toppled from power in 1986, returns at a time when Haiti is struggling to recover from a devastating earthquake and amid a fraught election campaign  \u2022 TNK-BP boss predicted break-up of Russian joint venture  BP&apos;s top executive in Russia predicted that its TNK-BP subsidiary would be carved up by the end of this year by Rosneft, the British oil company&apos;s new partner, acting with Gazprom, according to leaked US embassy cables. The revelation casts further doubt on the future of TNK-BP, after the Russian co-owners protested that BP&apos;s alliance with the Kremlin-backed Rosneft \u2013 announced on Friday night \u2013 could breach the terms of their joint venture. According to the cable, which was dated November 2008, the executive also said that BP saw Rosneft as its long-term partner in Russia rather than TNK-BP "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2011/jan/18/hello-tablets-goodbye-netbooks", "publicationDate": "2011-01-18T23:55:00Z", "tags": ["Tablet computers", "Apple", "Computing", "Technology", "Acer"], "sentences": ["&quot;The tablet launches will begin a gradual replacement of Acer&apos;s small laptop-style netbook computers, in line with market demands, Taiwan sales manager Lu Bing-hsian said."], "title": "Here come the tablets... and there go the netbooks", "article": "Grey market iPad on sale in Nairobi. Photo by smagdali on Flickr. Some rights reserved To those who reckoned that netbooks were going to be a feature of computing life for ever and ever: bad news. Acer, the world&apos;s second-largest PC maker in 2010, is dumping them.  Instead it plans to start selling &quot;two or three&quot; tablet computers in the first half of this year, according to a company sales manager talking to Computerworld.   &quot;The tablet launches will begin a gradual replacement of Acer&apos;s small laptop-style netbook computers, in line with market demands, Taiwan sales manager Lu Bing-hsian said.   &quot;&apos;They are aimed at phasing out netbooks,&apos; he said. &apos;That&apos;s the direction of the market.&apos;&quot;  It will make fewer netbooks, because it sees tablets gaining in popularity. Interestingly, the Acer tablets, running Android, will not be based on ARM chips - as pretty much every other extant Andrdoid tablet is - but instead use Intel Sandy Bridge four-core CPUs. The biggest will have a 10-inch screen. Acer tried before with tablets: remember its 12-inch product early last year? No, hardly anyone else does either - it sold around 250 per month and was quietly killed in July. But now Apple has validated the market, selling 7.33m iPads in the past quarter alone - which means that in 2010 it sold a total of 14.8m of the devices. (Read about its record financial quarter.) Many of the most recent ones sold seem to have been 3G versions, judging by details given out in the analyst call with Apple&apos;s earnings on Tuesday night which said that the average iPad selling price was $600. Of course we&apos;ve seen from CES that there are dozens of companies ready to leap into the tablet market, though there are only a few which look like they might do something dramatic. The 10-inch Motorola Xoom, which will run Android Honeycomb (3.0) looks good, but don&apos;t believe anyone who says they have had a hands-on: no journalist has yet tried a Xoom running Honeycomb, because it simply isn&apos;t ready. Asus also hopes to have a Honeycomb tablet, but it doesn&apos;t know when the software is ready. All of which led Tim Cook, Apple&apos;s chief operating officer, and the man in charge of the house while Steve Jobs is on indefinite medical leave, to sniff that with the 7&quot; tablets now flooding the market &quot;you wind up having a size of tablet that&apos;s less than what we believe is reasonable or would provide a real tablet experience.&quot; Much as you&apos;ve heard or read Steve Jobs say. But Cook also took a swipe at the Honeycomb tablets, and HP and RIM, who have promised much but not allowed anything you&apos;d call a hands-on: &quot;the next generation of tablets - there&apos;s nothing shipping yet, so I don&apos;t know. They lack performance specs, pricing, timing - today, they&apos;re vapour. We will assess them when they come out.&quot; So much, by the way, for RIM co-CEO Jim Balsillie&apos;s claim during RIM&apos;s earnings call that enterprise customers were putting off any deployment of iPads and waiting instead for RIM&apos;s PlayBook to come out. Cook took some pleasure from listing Fortune 100 companies that are testing or deploying them, and noted that it is being &quot;deployed or tested&quot; in 80% of the US Fortune 100 companies (up from 65% at the last earnings calls), and 60% of FTSE 100 companies.  And if - if - you were to include iPads as computers (something that companies like Gartner and IDC decline to do), points out TechFlash, then Apple would have been the second-biggest computer maker in the world in the fourth quarter. Think that sounds extreme? Things are changing in the computing world. The Wall Street Journal reckons that &quot;the era of the personal computer is drawing to a close&quot; - with Gartner calculating that by 2013 the number of smartphones will pass the number of PCs, by 1.82bn to 1.78bn. And that&apos;s leaving out the tablets. The article is definitely worth reading. \u2022 IBM reported its quarterly results last night too. It had record revenues, of $29.02bn, and record profits - $5.3bn. And IBM is the world&apos;s largest IT company in terms of sales. \u2022 For comparison: Apple&apos;s quarterly revenues were $26.74bn (a record; previous quarter $20.34bn), profits $6bn (a record; previous quarter $4.3bn). \u2022 Microsoft will report its latest quarterly earnings on 27 January (8m Kinects sold! Make a date!). For each of the last three quarters its revenues have been smaller than Apple&apos;s (ranging from $14.5bn to $16.2bn) but its profits have been bigger ($5.1bn to $7.1bn). Take a bow, Windows and Office. So expect that 2011 is going to be the year of the tablet. At one point Cook was asked if he didn&apos;t worry that computer sales were being cannibalised by tablet sales. &quot;The other guys [PC makers] lose a lot more than us, and we have a lot more to win, because we&apos;re underrepresented in that [PC] market. Cannibalisation isn&apos;t something we are spending one minute on here.&quot; It might be something for Acer - and all the other computer manufacturers - to think about though."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/19/asian-male-supermodel-godfrey-gao", "publicationDate": "2011-01-19T20:00:02Z", "tags": ["Models", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Taiwan", "Retail industry", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Meet Godfrey Gao, the Taiwanese actor-turned-model, newly named face of Louis Vuitton and world&apos;s first Asian male supermodel.", "Gao, who lives in Vancouver, is already famous in Taiwan, having starred in popular TV dramas, but the Vuitton campaign will be a fast-track towards becoming an international household face."], "title": "The world's first Asian male supermodel", "article": "The strong jawline, the &quot;blue steel&quot; brow and the manly forearm.

Despite its claim to be a leading promoter of corporate ethics worldwide, the maker of iPads and iPhones came joint bottom among 29 major IT firms in a transparency study drawn up by a coalition of China&apos;s leading environmental groups. &quot;Behind their stylish image, Apple products have a side many do not know about \u2013 pollution and poison. This side is hidden deep within the company&apos;s secretive supply chain,&quot; claims a statement by the 36 groups involved in the Green Choice Initiative. Their report \u2013 the fourth to look at the impact of global brands on China&apos;s environment \u2013 considers the openness of IT firms and their responsiveness to reports of environmental violations at suppliers. It follows a series of workplace poisonings, heavy metal contamination incidents and suicides at Chinese factories that supply materials and components for mobile phones and computers. Many leading brands outsource production to little-known Chinese firms, where labour costs can be lower, safety standards weaker and environmental regulations more lax than in the west. Foreign companies say they promote global levels of corporate social responsibility. Apple&apos;s supplier code of conduct claims to draw upon &quot;internationally recognised standards to advance social and environmental responsibility&quot;. But it is difficult for third parties to hold foreign firms to account because they tend to be secretive about their suppliers, citing corporate confidentiality. This lack of transparency, combined with official corruption and dire political accountability, has made China a haven for polluters. In recent years, more than 3,000 children have been diagnosed with unsafe levels of lead in their blood in a series of heavy-metal contamination outbreaks near smelting plants. Many of the facilities provided materials used in the batteries and casings for foreign IT firms. None of the 29 firms in the survey obliged their suppliers to disclose details of waste discharges, though there were big differences in their responses to public inquiries and reported environmental problems. Apple was ranked \u2013 alongside other major consumer electronics firms \u2013 as the least willing to provide data or to answer questions about suppliers. The authors say Apple&apos;s suppliers have been involved in breaches of environmental regulations. The report noted waste discharge violations in recent years at several Chinese firms that are thought to be part of Apple&apos;s supply chain. Labour conditions were also called into question when at least a dozen workers jumped to their deaths last spring at the Foxconn electronics complex in Shenzhen, which makes parts for Apple and other foreign companies. Critics say foreign firms are largely responsible for pollution because they insist on low prices, which puts pressure on suppliers to cut costs and corners. This is disputed by the companies. Apple&apos;s reticence was heavily criticised last May, when at least 62 workers fell sick after inhaling n-hexane used to clean touch screens at a Wintek electronics factory in Suzhou. The managers at the Taiwan-owned plant reportedly switched to the noxious chemical \u2013 which can cause nerve damage for up to two years \u2013 apparently because it dried more quickly than alcohol, thus increasing efficiency. Hospitalised victims, cited in the new Green Choice video, said they made products for Apple and have written to the company&apos;s chief executive, Steve Jobs, requesting an explanation. &quot;We want to ask you whether or not you should be responsible for the supplier companies you have chosen?&quot; they ask in the letter. &quot;When you look down at the Apple phone you are using in your hand and you swipe it with your finger is it possible that you can feel as if it is no longer a beautiful screen to show off, but the life and the blood of us employees and victims? Did you supervise the auditing staff to ensure that they were responsible and diligent?&quot; Nokia and Motorola responded to questions about their involvement with Wintek soon after the poisoning was revealed. Apple has yet to confirm or deny a relationship. The company said it would not comment on individual allegations. The report&apos;s authors say they tried for months to raise Wintek with Apple, but it refused to comment directly. &quot;This attitude means it is impossible to have any public supervision over their supply chain. Without that how can we trust them?&quot; said Ma Jun of the Institute for Public and Environmental Affairs. &quot;When environmental violations become public knowledge, they should not use commercial confidentiality as an excuse for silence.

(U) SUMMARY: May 19 and 20 arrests of two Taiwanese nationals attempting to smuggle a total of nearly 7 kg of heroin to Taiwan highlight increased drug arrests and seizures in Cambodia. The quantity of heroin seized during the weekend airport busts is large by Cambodian standards--authorities seized just 11 kg of heroin in 2005. Seizures of amphetamine-type stimulants are more than double last year&apos;s levels. Police and international observers credit USG and other foreign training with providing skills, motivation, and international pressure for the increase, but say that narcotics trafficking may also be on the rise. END SUMMARY. Heroin Seizures at Phnom Penh International Airport --------------------------------------------- ------- 2. (U) Police and customs officials seized nearly 7 kg of heroin and arrested three Taiwanese nationals in two separate incidents at Phnom Penh International Airport on May 19 and 20. These two cases represent an impressive intake for one weekend given that in 2005 Cambodian authorities seized just over 11 kg of heroin. 3. (SBU) Chen Hsin Hung, 57, was arrested on May 19 carrying 4.75 kg of heroin with a local street value of USD 95,000 to 133,000. Customs officials became suspicious when they noticed that Hung was carrying several bags of imported Taiwanese foil-wrapped candies back to Taiwan in his hand luggage. The candies turned out to be foil-wrapped packages of heroin. Hung, who was due to travel to Taiwan via Kuala Lumpur on Malaysian Airlines flight 755, had arrived in Phnom Penh the previous day. During his police interrogation, Hung said that he had been picked up at the airport and returned to the airport by a couple, whom the police identified as a Cambodian woman and a mainland Chinese or Taiwanese man. Police are attempting to locate the couple. 4. (SBU) A second Taiwanese man, who was standing near Chen Hsin Hung during the security process, appeared to be quite interested in the proceedings and upset by Hung&apos;s arrest, and had tickets for the same flight as Hung, was also arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking. Moek Dara noted that the investigation had revealed no evidence to indicate that the second individual was also involved in drug smuggling, but that it was the prosecutor&apos;s decision how to proceed in the case. 5. (SBU) On May 20, a 90-year-old Taiwanese national named Huang Sang Hou was arrested at Phnom Penh International Airport with 1.9 kg of heroin, worth USD 38,000 to USD 53,000. Hou reportedly came to Cambodia as a tourist intending to gamble. Over the course of a week, he lost the USD 4,000 he brought with him, borrowed an additional USD 2,000 from a Taiwanese national in Phnom Penh, and then lost that money as well. The Taiwanese lender then persuaded Hou to carry the heroin back to Taiwan. Airport customs officials were tipped off by the sloppy manner in which the heroin was packed on Hou&apos;s body, making him appear bloated. Hou cooperated with the police in identifying the Taiwanese lender, and Cambodian government officials have already passed his name, address, and passport information to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Hou had been planning to fly Dragon Airlines flight 207 to Hong Kong, and then to continue on to Taiwan. Amphetamine Seizures, Prices on the Rise ---------------------------------------- 6. (SBU) According to statistics from the Ministry of Interior&apos;s Anti-Drug Police and the National Authority for Combating Drugs (NACD), seizures of amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) tablets more than doubled when comparing the first four months of 2006 with the first four months of 2005. From January to April 2006, more than 220,000 ATS tablets were seized, whereas from January to April 2005, approximately 87,000 ATS tablets were seized. The number of offenders arrested also rose from 154 from January to April 2005 to 204 during January to April 2006. 7. (U) Both Brigadier General Moek Dara, Director of the Anti-Drugs Department, and World Health Organization XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that prices for ATS tablets have risen in the past few years, with particularly dramatic increases in the past 12 months. One year ago, a single ATS tablet sold for approximately one dollar in Phnom Penh, but now costs two to three dollars. Moek Dara noted that prices rise as the ATS tablets make their way along the drug route, from fifty cents per tablet in Laos, where the PHNOM PENH 00000983 002 OF 003 majority are produced, to USD 3 in Cambodia, and then even higher prices in two destination countries: USD 4 in Vietnam and USD 7.50 in Thailand. XXXXXXXXXXXX cited anecdotal evidence from NGOs that some ATS users are switching to injecting heroin, currently available for USD 1.50 to 2 in Phnom Penh, as a cheaper alternative to rising ATS prices. Lower Ecstasy Seizures Likely Point to Disrupted Network --------------------------------------------- ----------- 8. (U) In contrast to the dramatic rise in ATS seizures, seizures of ecstasy tablets are down sharply, from 1,900 in January to April 2005 to less than 800 in January to April 2006. Moek Dara and XXXXXXXXXXXX believe that lower levels of ecstasy seizures are a sign that supply has been disrupted following a cooperative DEA/Anti-Drug Police controlled delivery operation against the Peter Brown drug ring in 2004 and continued Anti-Drug Police action against the ring in 2005. USG Training Provides Needed Skills, International Pressure --------------------------------------------- -------------- 9. (SBU) Moek Dara gave much of the credit for the dramatic increase in heroin and ATS seizures and drug arrests to counternarcotics training funded by the State Department&apos;s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) and conducted by the DEA. Before the training sessions, which were conducted in January and April 2006, police officers along Cambodia&apos;s porous northern border were not very active and would not even conduct foot patrols in the forest, according to Moek Dara. Now, however, the officers have more skills and are more motivated to patrol actively, he said, and have seized drugs and a lot of drug production equipment as well. Customs, immigration, and police officials at the airports are also better trained and more active, and Moek Dara noted that all of the officials involved in the weekend&apos;s airport arrests had completed DEA training. 10. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX gave partial credit for increased anti-drug activity to counternarcotics training by the US and other foreign donors. Some high-ranking Cambodian police and military officials are rumored to be complicit in narcotics trafficking, he noted. He speculated that the training and pressure on the Cambodian government to clamp down on drug activity has finally made an impression on higher ranking officials, and lower-level officers are &quot;being allowed&quot; to make more seizures. At the same time, such a dramatic increase is probably also an indication of efforts to traffic increased amounts of ATS through Cambodia, he opined. Trainees Enthusiastic about INL/DEA Courses ------------------------------------------- 11. (U) Provincial Anti-Drug Police officers who attended the January Basic Counternarcotics course reported uniformly enthusiastic assessments to an embassy follow-up survey. Participating police captains reported an increased awareness of drug smuggling tactics, best practices in seizing and preparing evidence, and how to identify drugs using field test kits. Captain Preap Sovann of the Svay Rieng Anti-Drug Police noted that the training also promoted inter-agency and inter-province cooperation as well. All captains reported training their staffs in the key topics covered by the DEA training, and captains in Koh Kong and Pursat provinces reported conducting anti-drug outreach to primary and secondary school students as well. Trainees suggested that future courses provide written materials in Khmer as well as English, include information on money laundering, have more laboratory equipment available for in-class practice in drug identification, and include more time in simulations. Police Officer Arrested on Drug Charges --------------------------------------- 11. (C) Nov Sophal, a municipal police officer in the southern city of Kep, was arrested on April 15 and charged with trafficking 1 kg of heroin. Moek Dara was not expansive when asked about the case, noting simply that it is not uncommon for low-ranking police and military officials to be arrested for drug trafficking. In contrast, XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that drug investigations of police or military officials are very rare, and speculated that the individual involved may even have run afoul of rumored higher-level police involvement in narcotics. 12. (SBU) COMMENT: While increased smuggling activity may PHNOM PENH 00000983 003 OF 003 account for some of the increased seizures and arrests, it is clear that the Cambodian government is turning up the heat on the country&apos;s drug smugglers. Training from the USG and other countries is playing a critical role in supporting this effort--both through the skills and enthusiasm imparted to the participants, and also through the implicit expectations of improved performance on the part of the police and other officials.

Members of the House said\u00a0afterwards that there had not been enough time to air their complaints as Hu only took two questions before going on\u00a0to hold a separate meeting with senior senators. Hu met John Boehner, the house speaker, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, both of whom shunned invitations to the state dinner for the Chinese leader on last night. The Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, also turned down the invitation. The only member of the congressional &quot;big four&quot; to attend the dinner was the Democratic house leader, Nancy Pelosi. The hostile reception on Capitol Hill contrasts with Hu&apos;s day with Barack\u00a0Obama yesterday, when the US president pushed him over human rights but otherwise put the stress on common ground. China&apos;s state TV media lapped up the pomp of the visit but largely avoided mention of the part of the Obama-Hu press conference when the Chinese president was pressed on human rights. Reid, the most powerful Democrat in Congress, called Hu a dictator in an interview on Tuesday night, but made\u00a0a half-hearted retraction the next day: &quot;Maybe I shouldn&apos;t have said &apos;dictator&apos;, but they have a different type of government than we have \u2013 and that is an understatement.&quot; The two posed for pictures in the Senate today, but aides insisted they would not take questions. A reporter asked how Reid expected to get any business done with a man he had called a dictator, but neither man responded. Afterwards Howard Berman, a Democrat, said it had been frustrating that there had been no time to discuss the strong yuan, which members of Congress repeatedly claim is being manipulated by Beijing to help China&apos;s trade balance. Boehner said it was a good meeting and that he had raised lack of religious freedom, China&apos;s failure to respect intellectual property rights and Beijing&apos;s need to exercise more influence over North\u00a0Korea. &quot;Chinese leaders have a responsibility to do better and the United states has a responsibility to hold them to account,&quot; Boehner said. Pelosi asked about human rights, in particular the fate of the jailed dissident Liu Xiaobo, a Nobel laureate. Democrat Sandy Levin said Hu had given the same reply as he had at the White House: that China needed to do more on human rights. Tonight in a speech to US business leaders before leaving for Chicago, Hu said the US-China relationship must be based on mutual respect. Ignoring Pelosi&apos;s expression of concern only hours earlier about Tibet, Hu said the US must recognise that Tibet and Taiwan are &quot;issues that concern China&apos;s territorial integrity and China&apos;s core interests.&quot; The house foreign affairs committee yesterday held a meeting to coincide with Hu&apos;s visit to the White House. Among those at the meeting were the Republican Dana Rohrabacher, one of the most hostile members of Congress towards Beijing, who told CNN Hu is &quot;a gangster regime that murders its own people&quot;. In a separate interview, Rohrabacher described the Chinese government as Nazis. Little of substance has so far emerged from the visit. Much of a $45bn (\u00a328bn) in trade deals had been announced earlier. The only concrete announcement is China&apos;s agreement to extend the stay of two pandas at Washington national zoo by five years."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2011/jan/20/us-politics-thursday-round-up", "publicationDate": "2011-01-20T19:39:38Z", "tags": ["US politics"], "sentences": ["If you look at the economic success of Chinese people in Taiwan or Hong Kong or Singapore or diaspora communities around the world, the striking thing about the PRC is how poor it still is."], "title": "Playing catch-up | Michael Tomasky", "article": "Hi gang, sorry for the delay today. We had to take the kid to the doctors&apos; this morning, so I was not able to start my day the usual way, which is scanning the news around 6:30 am and getting up a post or two in the morning. Everything is fine, by the way, thanks. So let&apos;s catch up on the day&apos;s events. First, the hoot of the day is the ridiculous Daily Caller headline trying to blame last year&apos;s uptick in pedestrian deaths on Michelle Obama&apos;s anti-obesity campaign. The idea here is that the first lady has sent more people out there walking, so more are dying. I&apos;m pretty sure the DC, which obviously takes some pride in writing obscenely over-the-top headlines, did this one just to goad liberals into being outraged, so I won&apos;t take the bait. Who knows, maybe they&apos;re right about the connection. Come on, Tucker, let&apos;s you and me go out cruising one night and brush past overweight pedestrians. Teach &apos;em a lesson, out there trying to lose weight on the Kenyan-socialist plan. Item two: She&apos;s running: &quot;Have there been informal conversations between supporters on the ground in Iowa and with the PAC? Of course there have,&quot; SarahPAC Treasurer Tim Crawford told POLITICO. &quot;Do we have supporters all across the nation? Yes,&quot; he continued. &quot;Do we have supporters in Iowa? Yes. Do those supporters want Sarah Palin to run for higher office? Yes, of course they do.&quot; That catechismic sentence structure is always a dead giveaway. I really dislike it and wish people would stop talking like that. Do I ever lapse into it? Occasionally, sure. And what am I hoping to convey when I do? That I&apos;m saying something without really saying it, if you get my drift. It would seem to me that she has to do something before she announces to try to fix some of the post-Arizona damage. Or maybe she doesn&apos;t even think that way and doesn&apos;t see it as damage at all. Item three: I read today that the Democratic convention for 2012 is likely going to be held in either St. Louis or Charlotte, North Carolina. St. Louis has been the front-runner but Claire McAskill is getting nervous that St. Loo hasn&apos;t been named yet. They&apos;re both good picks, and, building on the Denver location last time, they mark the firm arrival of the end of the era of Democrats hugging the coasts (Chicago being the only exception). Looking back, can you believe the Democrats held back to back conventions in New York City, in 1976 and 1980? And at a time when NYC was at its absolute lowest point: The foul and filthy city of Mean Streets, Taxi Driver and porn theater marquees blaring &quot;Four Erections!&quot; at passersby? And then they returned there again in 1992? Item four: I want to leave most of the China discussion to the Guardian&apos;s redoubtable diplomatic staff, but I think Yglesias makes a point here that isn&apos;t made often enough in all the stories about how China is taking over everything:  China is a dynamo and Greece is a basket case, but Greece is much richer than China. Rapid Chinese progress does in part reflects the skill and wisdom of Chinese policymakers. But in large part it merely reflects the madness of a previous generation of Chinese policymakers\u2014the people who left the country at such a low level in 1980 from which it&apos;s so rapidly been growing. If you look at the economic success of Chinese people in Taiwan or Hong Kong or Singapore or diaspora communities around the world, the striking thing about the PRC is how poor it still is.   I read a few weeks ago that the number of Chinese we&apos;d call middle class by our standards is infinitesimal, like 50 million people or something. I&apos;m sure in some ways the regime likes it this way because once they have a truly broad middle class, then it&apos;s only a matter of time before their political system will have to change, I think. The more poor people, the more authoritarian they can get away with being. Item five: Piers Morgan&apos;s debut on CNN came away with high ratings. But what I want to know is, are there any Americans employed on British television in this manner? I mean, our prime time is littered with speakers of the king&apos;s English, from Simon Cowell (okay, he&apos;s not there anymore, but was for years) to all these Cowell imitators, and now Morgan, and Jamie Oliver and who knows who else. David McCallum. Does this work in reverse? Why not? I really don&apos;t understand it at all. Do you think I could host a British television show, with my charming Yank accent and dapper West Virginia ways? I&apos;d move the whole mespoche there if someone offered me a show."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/25/chief-executives-coin-it-as-messiahs", "publicationDate": "2011-01-25T07:00:12Z", "tags": ["Steve Jobs", "Apple", "Executive pay and bonuses", "Computing", "Technology", "Davos", "Business", "Davos 2011"], "sentences": ["Take, for instance, the iPad: the display panel is probably from a Korean contractor, the backlight will have been knocked up by a Taiwanese firm and the GPS is likely to have been made in Germany.", "Then there is the battery (Chinese, perhaps), the flash memory (which could well be from Japan&apos;s Toshiba) and the case (Taiwan, again)."], "title": "CEOs like Steve Jobs style themselves as messiahs, not mere managers. But that's just an excuse to rake it in | Aditya Chakrabortty", "article": "What happened the last time you called into work sick? A sympathetic sentence from a colleague, possibly. Some quality time alone with Cash in the Attic, certainly. In due course came re-entry, with the brackish waters of the office closing overhead as swiftly as if you&apos;d never left. When Steve Jobs announced last week that he would be spending some time away from Apple, he promptly knocked \u00a312.5bn off the value of his employer. News of his sick leave made front pages and even had Wall Street analysts bemoaning the loss of a &quot;genius&quot;. Jobs has always been the best repackager in the technology industry. Over the past decade, he&apos;s alchemised the plain old MP3 player into the iPod, turned the corporate road warrior&apos;s mobile-email-browser-whatever into the iPhone and transformed the ugly tablet PC into the iPad. And last week, even as he took medical leave, the Apple boss did it again, setting the seal on the transformation of the chief executive into the figurehead of his own corporate cult. The man business hacks call iGod has been playing this game for decades. Down the years photos show him in that unchanging Boomer outfit of black mock turtlenecks and stonewashed denim \u2014 instant recognisability in an anonymous industry. Then there are his gnomic utterances and the annual religious convention, the Macworld Expo in San Francisco, where Jobs regularly turns up to lay hands on his devotees. This is free advertising for a company that needs to flog its products by the millions, of course \u2013 but the cult also numbers Apple&apos;s own staffers. &quot;It&apos;s Beatlemania,&quot; one former executive told the New Yorker in 1997 just as Jobs turned up on the company&apos;s Cupertino campus again, after 12 years away. The saviour was back. True, before Jobs rejoined the fold, the question most commonly asked about the company he co-founded was how long it had left before making the corporate obituaries. Yet that doesn&apos;t make its turnaround solely the work of one heavily stubbled mastermind, who saved a company through his singular vision, taste and liberal use of the i- prefix. The messiah talk ignores the fact that Apple has around 46,600 full-time employees and another 3,000 temporary staff \u2013 including some of the best designers and marketers in the business. Far from being a semi-mystical software visionary, Jobs is a ruthless office politician (during his long campaign to take back his company, reported the New Yorker in that 1997 article, one Apple alumnus warned: &quot;Steve is going to fuck Gil [Amelio, the former CEO] so hard his eardrums will pop.&quot;) Nor does it take into account the way in which global supply chains minimise the role of any one individual, no matter how powerful. Take, for instance, the iPad: the display panel is probably from a Korean contractor, the backlight will have been knocked up by a Taiwanese firm and the GPS is likely to have been made in Germany. Then there is the battery (Chinese, perhaps), the flash memory (which could well be from Japan&apos;s Toshiba) and the case (Taiwan, again). Jobs is part of a widespread trend among chief executives to put themselves forward not as managers, but as leaders. Follow the coverage of the Davos summit this week and count the number of times a corporate finance officer for some accounting-software company or other is described as a business leader. Elite MBA programmes boast of how they will turn students into &quot;change agents&quot;. As I type, the January 2007 cover of Harvard Business Review stares back at me. &quot;The Tests of a Leader&quot;, it blares, under a photo of some shirt-sleeved young Turk doing push-ups on a boardroom table. &quot;Managers do things right, leaders see the right thing is done,&quot; said Warren Bennis, founding father of Leadership studies. The implication was clear: a manager was good at painting by numbers, but a business leader was more akin to Turner. The result has been a tremendous boost in chief-executive power, according to Dennis Tourish, an academic at Kent University. He points out that just before Enron imploded it was run like a cult, with Jeff Skilling exercising huge control and influence over who was recruited, how they worked \u2013 and who got laid off. And while Enron was an exception, Tourish points out that Jack Welch as boss of General Electric had similar power. &quot;Business leaders typically only have yes-men \u2013 no one to stand up to them.&quot; In the end what the leadership talk appears to add up to is an alibi for bosses taking much more money out of the companies they run. There is John Thain who, even as he ran Merrill Lynch into the wall, demanded it pay $1.2m to redecorate his office, including $35,000 for a &quot;commode on legs&quot;. Then there is Mark Hurd, who ruled Hewlett-Packard with the iron law of pay for performance \u2013 until he was himself drummed out of office last August for alleged corporate malfeasance and took a severance package of $34.6m. And for Team GB, we have Fred the Shred and his outsize pension, and BP&apos;s Tony Hayward receiving millions for his role in turning the Gulf oil spill from a tragedy into a farce. Set against that lot, Jobs looks like an exemplar. But he is really the best example of an unhealthy trend."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jan/31/weird-new-world-computer-animated-news", "publicationDate": "2011-01-31T08:00:00Z", "tags": ["Animation", "Television", "Television & radio", "Culture", "Taiwan", "World news", "Media", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Since the Woods story, the Taiwanese animation studio has built an international cult following with a string of increasingly surreal viral hits involving cartoon versions of everyone from Wayne Rooney to Sarah Palin and Julian Assange \u2013 all pinging across the internet just a few hours after a story breaks.", "We have 14 production slots each day, and within each production slot we can do four stories \u2013 so that&apos;s 50-odd stories, and most of that production is for our own media outlets in Hong Kong and Taiwan.&quot; It is an ambitious offshoot of the Next Media organisation, a pan-Asian company started in Hong Kong by Jimmy Lai, an entrepreneur who once sold T-shirts honouring student leaders during the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 in the Giordano clothing chain \u2013 Hong Kong&apos;s answer to Gap.", "&quot;We have the Hong Kong Apple Daily newspaper, we have the Taiwan Apple Daily newspaper and we have the Taiwan TV station and then we have the international content, which is the content that most of our viewers overseas are familiar with,&quot; Logan says."], "title": "The weird new world of computer-animated news", "article": "It could have been anyone really: a\u00a0car crash, an affair and a golf club. But when this particular story broke at the end of November 2009, it was Tiger Woods who marked the start of an unlikely new medium for celebrity news: computer animation. As the story gained traction, 24-hour news channels across the world filled our screens with stock footage of Woods on a golf course, his wife Elin Nordegren in happier times and aerial shots of the road outside their house. Then a crazy slice of animation exploded across the internet, one of those &quot;you&apos;ve got to see THIS!&quot; OMG memes that fill inboxes and Facebook walls. Here was Woods (or rather, a\u00a0blocky, computer-generated approximation of him) at home with Nordegren. They&apos;re arguing. She wacks him in the face. He bursts out of their house, drives off in the family SUV; she chases after him and as he looks back at her brandishing a golf club (what else?), the car ploughs into a fire hydrant. Is this how he crashed? Who knows? What matters is that there was suddenly some exciting footage to feed into the news cycle. Welcome to the weird world of Next Media Animation (NMA), where they never let a little thing like a lack of video get in the way of showing the gory details of a celeb story. No paps on the scene? No problem: make it up! Since the Woods story, the Taiwanese animation studio has built an international cult following with a string of increasingly surreal viral hits involving cartoon versions of everyone from Wayne Rooney to Sarah Palin and Julian Assange \u2013 all pinging across the internet just a few hours after a story breaks. As the subtitles to a recent greatest hits compilation to mark its &quot;one year Tiger-versary&quot; put it: &quot;Over the past year, NMA has brought the world so many LOLs . . .&quot; If some of those &quot;LOLs&quot; have passed you by, you have missed the chance to see Rooney playing keepy-uppy in a hotel room in his England kit while two\u00a0scantily clad women do Suduko puzzles on the bed. Or Palin machine-gunning bears from a helicopter as her family lounge around the living room in tracksuits. Or Vince Cable stomping off after undercover reporters encouraged him to slag off Rupert Murdoch. Did you wonder why Ricky Gervais disappeared for an hour during the Golden Globes? According to the NMA version, he was getting bashed around by the Hollywood establishment unamused by his jokes \u2013 Tim &quot;Buzz Lightyear&quot; Allen takes a powerdrill to his funnybone. You might remember Gordon Brown on Channel 4 news insisting that of course he&apos;s never hit anyone \u2013 in the NMA animated version, you also get to see Brown decking an aide and punching the back of the car seat so hard that his driver goes flying (the words &quot;FUCKING EGO&quot; float across the\u00a0screen). The story about the undercover police officers infiltrating environmental protest groups? Here they are, in bed. NMA has even found a way to represent the shady actions of whole countries. When the WikiLeaks story broke about the US spying on UN diplomats, there was Uncle Sam in a top hat and stars-and-stripes outfit, like a deranged Colonel Sanders, sneaking around the UN loos in search of DNA samples, before getting into a punch-up with Assange. Meanwhile, the Nobel peace prize announcement had China (an angry panda in a red army cap waving a baseball bat around) chasing after its dissidents and bullying other countries. All the videos are in Mandarin, with English and Chinese subtitles, and are wrapped up with a cheery signoff from cartoon NMA News anchor girls Vanessa and Jen-Jen. It&apos;s as if The Sims have come alive and started up their own international news station. Just as interesting as the outlandish content is the ferocious speed with which the company produces it all. This instant noodle Pixar is even more impressive when you learn that the clips of Obama, Rooney and Assange are &quot;just a fraction&quot; of the company&apos;s daily output. Michael Logan, NMA&apos;s business and content development manager, explains: &quot;Next Media Animation has 300 animators, we produce close to three hours of finished content per week. We have 14 production slots each day, and within each production slot we can do four stories \u2013 so that&apos;s 50-odd stories, and most of that production is for our own media outlets in Hong Kong and Taiwan.&quot; It is an ambitious offshoot of the Next Media organisation, a pan-Asian company started in Hong Kong by Jimmy Lai, an entrepreneur who once sold T-shirts honouring student leaders during the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 in the Giordano clothing chain \u2013 Hong Kong&apos;s answer to Gap. In Asia, the Next clips depict anything from serial killers to tawdry murder cases, but it is the\u00a0use of western politicians and celebrities that has seen its videogame-like cartoons appearing everywhere from Newsnight to CNN. &quot;We have the Hong Kong Apple Daily newspaper, we have the Taiwan Apple Daily newspaper and we have the Taiwan TV station and then we have the international content, which is the content that most of our viewers overseas are familiar with,&quot; Logan says. &quot;Because it&apos;s news, obviously we have to turn it around quickly \u2013 within the news cycle. So when a piece goes into production, within about three hours we have finished animation that&apos;s ready to use. We&apos;re constantly refining the process to get it faster and faster. &quot;It&apos;s sort of like an editorial cartoon that you might see on the opinion page [of a newspaper], but since it&apos;s animation it&apos;s like having a dozen \u2013 two dozen \u2013 editorial cartoons all within 90 seconds. Typically when you do animation you make the 3D model first before you begin to animate. Making the models takes weeks and weeks and weeks. Because we have a vast database of models already made, we can just go into the library, grab the models we need, adjust them to get them to look the way we want, and then proceed to animation. That&apos;s the reason we can do it three hours as opposed to three weeks or three months.&quot; NMA uses body motion capture animation technology similar to that used in films such as Avatar or Spider-Man, with actors playing a versions of incidents where no footage exists. Information from nodes connected to the actor&apos;s suit is then fed into the computer animators and used to drive the avatar characters in the short clips. &quot;We custom-made our Obama model and that took three weeks to do. Sarah Palin \u2013 we haven&apos;t got round to making a custom model for her,&quot; says\u00a0Logan. &quot;At the moment we have something that sort of resembles her \u2013 every time she appears she has a machine gun, that&apos;s sort of the prop that identifies her. You can do that with certain politicians. With David Miliband, he&apos;s famous for making some gaffe with a banana, so we&apos;d depict him with a banana. Ed Miliband, we might give him a red cape \u2013 Red Ed.&quot; Another story the studio jumped on was the reports of early iPhone 4 users complaining about dropped calls when holding the phone in a certain way. NMA&apos;s version had Steve Jobs as Darth Vader solving the problem by cutting off fingers with his lightsabre. &quot;His reality distortion field is so strong that he would view the last two fingers on your hand as the design flaw and not the iPhone 4 as having the design flaw. His way of fixing it is to chop off the fingers rather than fixing the phone,&quot; Logan says, deadpan. Even if the rich, famous and powerful avoid film crews and paparazzi, they can&apos;t stop the world visualising the truth behind stories about them. &quot;We try to choose things for which there is no original video and you can use animation to bring out the visual images,&quot; says Logan. &quot;The WikiLeak cables say Muammar Gaddafi hangs around with a Ukranian nurse \u2013 we can show that through animation. From what we&apos;re aware of, there&apos;s no footage of that.&quot; As Vanessa and Jen-Jen warn cheerfully, at the end of their &quot;Tiger-versary&quot; compilation: &quot;So, watch out, guys. Wherever you are in the world. If you&apos;re famous enough and behave badly enough, you might end up in our of our pieces. Don&apos;t make us animate you!&quot; 1954 to 2011 . . . 50 years of changing TV news technology \u25b6 The onscreen newsreader (1954): The first BBC news bulletin was presented by Richard Baker. However, viewers at the time wouldn&apos;t have realised because his &quot;illustrated summary of the news&quot; consisted entirely of maps and still photographs while he read the stories offscreen. When the unpopularity of this approach was revealed, talking faces were quickly drafted in, the first being correspondent ER Thompson. Over the decades, newsreaders would be augmented by reports from correspondents, first by phone, then through video and finally by hologram (see below). \u25b6 The news ticker (1992): A technology thought to be popularised by German news channel N-TV, the ticker ensured viewers would never miss important information again. Sometimes supporting facts run underneath a story. Sometimes news about another story runs underneath. Sometimes only the words &quot;Breaking news&quot; runs underneath a story with no accompanying text, to reinforce how important the news is. It was genuinely revolutionary. \u25b6 The Day Today (1994): By the early 90s, news had become unstoppably authoritarian, full of newsreaders sitting in chilly blue prison planets surrounded by whirling globes and computer-generated glass. This approach was spoofed mercilessly in Chris Morris&apos;s news satire The Day Today, where objects were manipulated in increasingly impossible ways. Five years later, BBC News replaced the showy bombast with a warmer palette and desks that actually existed. \u25b6 Election Night technology: Happily the graphics geeks were still let out on election night, allowing Peter Snow&apos;s two-dimensional Swingometer to become needlessly complicated. First it flew out of its screen. Then it transformed into a virtual roulette wheel. Then it grew steps, allowing pundits to stroll around inside it. And then, perfectly, in 2006 it turned into a monkey with John Major&apos;s face that Jeremy Vine could crouch down and talk to. \u25b6 The roving anchor (1997): To add dynamism to a stale formula, Channel Five stole Kirsty Young&apos;s chair and made her read the news while perched on her desk like a chatty co-worker. This evolutionary breakthrough eventually led to Sky&apos;s adoption of its news wall \u2013 a giant seven-metre screen that stretched all the way across the studio floor, allowing presenters to wander across it whenever they either wanted to convey scale. Three years after that, ITV News got silly and spoiled it all by spending a million pounds on something it called the Theatre Of News, a concept so obviously ridiculous that nobody has ever been known to actually refer to it out loud. \u25b6 CNN hologram (2008): As if Barack Obama&apos;s election win wasn&apos;t already historic enough, CNN decided to add to\u00a0the occasion by rolling out its new holographic technology. Several cameras could shoot a remote correspondent in three dimensions, and then beam it to the studio to make\u00a0it seem like they were really there. Of all the Star Wars technology that could have been invented by CNN,\u00a0this is almost certainly the most\u00a0disappointing.

In its first two years, the Obama administration largely steered clear of signing trade treaties. Yet, in his state of the union address last week, the president said he would reinvigorate efforts to pass Bush-era deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama \u2013 as well as pursue a new treaty with numerous Pacific-rim nations. As the president and Congress evaluate the merits of these treaties, they should see to it that no deal is passed that limits the ability of the US or its trading partners to prevent and mitigate financial crises. Ironically, many of the trading partners involved in these agreements have imposed measures that the treaties would declare illegal. One particular flaw in US treaties is their outdated insistence on prohibiting the use of capital controls to slow the flow of &quot;hot&quot; money. Citing an emerging consensus in the economics profession and in institutions such as the International Monetary Fund that capital controls are legitimate tools to prevent and mitigate crises, 250 economists from the United States and across the world are this Monday urging the US to reform pending and future treaties to &quot;permit governments to deploy capital controls without being subject to investor claims&quot;. In the wake of the financial crisis, nations such as Brazil, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand have all used capital controls to stem the massive inflows of speculative investment entering their economies and wreaking havoc on their exchange rates and asset markets. South Korea, where the won has appreciated by 30% since 2008, has direct limits on foreign exchange speculation, for example, and has also levied an outflows tax on capital gains of foreign purchases of government bonds. In the runup to the financial crisis, Colombia&apos;s 2007 capital controls required foreign investors to park a percentage of their investment in the central bank, which helped that nation escape some of the damage from the global financial crisis. Chile and Malaysia, two nations that form part of Obama&apos;s newly-planned trade deal with Pacific rim nations, successfully used capital controls in the 1990s to avoid the worst of the damages during crises in that decade. US trade treaties, however, require that capital be allowed to flow between trading partners &quot;freely and without delay&quot;. Restrictions on the entry and exit of capital violate this standard in absolute terms. Measures that withhold the ability of US investors to move investment out of nations \u2013 such as through an outflows tax (South Korea), or by being required to keep capital with a central bank for a minimum period (Colombia) \u2013 are of particular concern. Language in US treaties would allow room for such actions to seen as expropriating US investments. It&apos;s bad enough that the US trade deals outlaw important and prudent financial management. But the agreements also give the enforcement of such bans new teeth by allowing banks and other investors to sue governments directly if the capital controls reduce their profits or restrict their ability to continue speculating. In response to pressure from members of Congress such as Barney Frank and Carl Levin, a few recent US trade agreements put some limits on the amount of damages foreign investors may receive as compensation for certain capital control measures, and require an extended &quot;cooling off&quot; period before investors may file their claims. In the end, however, nations are still liable under treaty for actions they may take to mitigate crises. The coalition behind the economists&apos; statement attests to the fact that there is broad support for reforming US trade treaties&apos; terms on capital controls. The list includes prominent academic economists who have been supportive of free trade deals, former IMF officials, and some economists affiliated with the pro-trade Peterson Institute for International Economics. The economists should be listened to: US trade treaties should not be tools for US financial policies that are not only outdated, but actually helped cause the financial crisis in the first place. Allowing flexibility for the use of capital controls to prevent and mitigate crises now has broad support. Our trading partners have been requesting such flexibility for years; granting it would represent one small step toward a more stable financial system. US banks and investment houses played a role in nearly destroying the global economy. Why should the Obama administration ban the measures that prevent contagion, while giving those same firms the right to sue foreign governments for damages?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/feb/05/lets-move-to-holt-norfolk", "publicationDate": "2011-02-05T00:01:01Z", "tags": ["Property", "Homes", "Money", "Life and style", "House prices"], "sentences": ["The case against It&apos;s all artisan this, vintage that \u2013 sometimes you just want white sliced, made in Taiwan."], "title": "Let's move to Holt, Norfolk", "article": "What&apos;s going for it?

In the programme, when debating whether Yamaguchi was the luckiest or the unluckiest man on the planet, one panellist said: &quot;Is the glass of water half full or half empty? Either way, it is definitely radioactive \u2026 don&apos;t drink it.&quot; The same joke about an Auschwitz survivor and Zyklon B would never have passed. The BBC apologised, but the furore in Japan has intensified. Nuclear victims groups, the mayor of Nagasaki and Japan&apos;s foreign minister, as well as users of Japanese social media, have expressed their anger. As the BBC is Britain&apos;s state television, it has damaged Britain&apos;s image in Japan. But few seem to care: the rare British comments on the internet range from mildly sympathetic to &quot;they got what they deserved&quot;. That jokes about nuclear victims touch a raw nerve in Japan should not have been a surprise. Many victims are still alive, and there are people still suffering from the effects of the nuclear bombs. Yamaguchi was in bandages for 12 years. His wife was exposed to radioactive &quot;black rain&quot; and both children suffered health problems. Yamaguchi kept silent for years (amid the unknowns of radiation, victims have suffered discrimination). After his son died prematurely from cancer, he decided to tell his story. His daughter, Toshiko, said about the BBC: &quot;To laugh about this \u2026 is not something you do as a human being. I cannot tolerate it. They don&apos;t understand.&quot; There are issues surrounding Japanese public memories of the war. But suffice it to say that the way Japanese deal with it is more complex than is usually portrayed. Japan is the only nation that has suffered from nuclear attack; nuclear victim organisations and many other Japanese people feel that their country has a unique perspective on nuclear issues and an obligation to share the memories \u2013 especially with countries that possess a nuclear arsenal. For many, opposition to nuclear weapons has played a large role in Japan&apos;s postwar identity as a pacifist nation. The apathy around the BBC incident in Britain is a sign that for many people, Hiroshima and the Asia-Pacific war is something that does not concern them. Britain seems more and more to revel in a romantic memory of the &quot;good war&quot; and especially the blitz. Just look at the finale of The King&apos;s Speech: all together, standing firm against tyranny. Apparently it is still necessary to remind people that the reality was messier. Britain was not just standing up to the tyranny of the Nazis. In the same war, Britain was fighting Japan in Malaya, Burma and India trying to defend a colonial empire that was fundamentally racist and undemocratic. The Japanese, in their quest to become an equal partner to the western great powers, had since the 1890s acquired their own colonial empire in Taiwan, Korea, Micronesia and Manchuria. When war came, the Japanese hailed their military offensives in 1941 against the western powers in Malaya, Singapore, Burma, the Philippines and Indonesia as the &quot;liberation from western colonialism&quot;. The brutal occupations that followed can hardly be called that. At best, this was a war of one colonial empire against another. But it remains an uncomfortable truth that the Japanese caused the end of the British (and Dutch and French) empire in Asia. Of course, Britain did not drop the bomb, but it did play a key role in the evolution of the practice of bombing civilians, which ultimately led to the atomic bombings. Ironically, it was Britain under Winston Churchill that developed terror bombing, in Iraq in the 1920s. The harsh reality of the blitz also provided new lessons for the bombing campaigns against Germany and later Japan. In developing bombing strategy with the US, the RAF was the big advocate for carpet bombing of civilian targets. The strategic bombing campaign in Japan wiped out most major cities and more than sixty smaller cities. The M69 incendiary cluster bombs were especially designed to break through the roofs and release burning oil jelly inside Japanese wooden houses; Napalm delivered in your living room. On top of this came the nuclear attacks. A traumatised Yamaguchi remembered crossing a river packed with &quot;charcoaled bodies, floating one next to the other like log rafts.&quot; General Curtis LeMay famously said that &quot;if we&apos;d lost the war, we&apos;d all have been prosecuted as war criminals&quot;. American historian Mark Selden has called the allied bombing campaign a &quot;forgotten holocaust&quot;. This was not the &quot;good war.&quot; And tasteless jokes about A-bomb victims thrive on misplaced nostalgia and historical amnesia."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/10/karmapa-lama-cash-beijing-chinese", "publicationDate": "2011-02-10T15:27:44Z", "tags": ["Tibet", "Buddhism", "Dalai Lama", "India", "China", "World news", "Religion", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["China had several possible motives for staging his &quot;escape&quot;, including a desire to strengthen his claim to the title at a time when the rival contender (backed by important interests in India, Bhutan and Taiwan) appeared to be gaining ground."], "title": "Is the Karmapa an agent of Beijing or a political scapegoat? | Brahma Chellaney", "article": "The seizure by police of large sums of Chinese currency from the Indian monastery of the Karmapa \u2013 one of the most important figures in Tibetan Buddhism \u2013 has revived old suspicions about his continuing links with China and forced him to deny that he is an &quot;agent of Beijing&quot;. The Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama, and the Karmapa are the three highest figures in Tibetan Buddhism, representing parallel institutions that have intermittently been at odds with each other throughout their history. And China, seeking to tighten its grip on Tibet, has worked to control the traditional process of finding the reincarnation of any senior lama that passes away. Thus, in 1992, China helped select the seven-year-old Ogyen Trinley Dorje as the 17th Karmapa, installing him at Tibet&apos;s Tsurphu monastery \u2013 the Karmapas&apos; ancestral abode, which was almost destroyed during the cultural revolution. He became the first reincarnated &quot;living Buddha&quot; to be recognised and ratified by Communist China. But then, in 1999, Dorje staged a stunning escape to India via Nepal, attracting the world&apos;s attention, but also deep suspicion, because of the apparent ease with which he and his entourage managed to flee. The Dalai Lama has hosted him at the Gyuto monastery in Dharamsala, India, ever since. Earlier, in 1995, China installed its own Panchen Lama after its security services abducted the Tibetans&apos; six-year-old appointee, who has simply disappeared, along with his family. Now, China is waiting for the current Dalai Lama \u2013 who is over 75 and has had bouts of ill health in recent years \u2013 to pass away, so that it can anoint his successor, too. But the Dalai Lama, the charismatic face of the Tibetan movement, has made it clear that his successor will come from the &quot;free world&quot;, thereby excluding Chinese-ruled Tibet. This has set the stage for the emergence of two rival Dalai Lamas, one chosen by China and the other by the Tibetan exile movement. In fact, the Chinese-appointed Karmapa has a doppelganger Karmapa, who has set up shop in New Delhi. With both the Karmapas in India, the Indian government has sought to maintain peace by barring the contenders from the sacred Rumtek monastery in the Indian Himalayan state of Sikkim. Against this background, the discovery of large sums of Chinese and other foreign currency has ignited a fresh controversy over Dorje. While his supporters have staged protests against the police raid and interrogation of their leader, Indian officials have expressed apprehension that China may be funding Dorje as part of a plan to influence the Karmapa&apos;s Kagyu sect, which controls important monasteries along the militarised Indo-Tibetan border. According to Xu Zhitao, an official at the Chinese Communist party central committee&apos;s united front work department, the allegation that &quot;the Karmapa [may be] a Chinese agent or spy shows that India is keeping its mistrustful attitude toward China&quot;. But such an attitude seems warranted: Xu&apos;s Tibet division is tasked with overseeing monastic institutions, inculcating &quot;patriotic&quot; norms among monks and nuns \u2013 through re-education when necessary \u2013 and infiltrating the Tibetan resistance movement and Tibetan Buddhist monasteries on both sides of the Indo-Tibetan frontier. Communities in the Himalayan region have historically been closely integrated. But, with Tibet locked behind an iron curtain since the 1951 Chinese annexation, the economies and cultures of the entire Himalayan region have weakened. Tibetan Buddhism, however, still serves as the common link, with the Karmapa&apos;s Kagyu sect a powerful force on the Indian side. The cash haul has reopened the question that arose in 1999: Was China behind Dorje&apos;s flight to India, or is he a genuine defector who simply got fed up with living in a gilded Chinese cage? China had several possible motives for staging his &quot;escape&quot;, including a desire to strengthen his claim to the title at a time when the rival contender (backed by important interests in India, Bhutan and Taiwan) appeared to be gaining ground. Had Dorje remained in Tibet, he could have lost out to his rival, because the 280-year-old Rumtek monastery, the Kagyu school&apos;s holiest institution, is where the sect&apos;s all-powerful &quot;black hat&quot;, the symbolic crown of the Karmapa \u2013 believed to be woven from the hair of female deities \u2013 is located. China would also have drawn comfort from the fact that, within the murky world of intra-Tibetan politics, its anointed Karmapa, oddly, had the Dalai Lama&apos;s backing. Historically, the Dalai Lamas and Karmapas vied with each other for influence until the Dalai Lama&apos;s Gelug school gained ascendancy over the Kagyu order. According to Tibetan tradition, however, the Dalai Lama has no role in selecting or endorsing a Karmapa. The Dalai Lama in this case gave his approval for purely political reasons. The previous Karmapa died in 1981, and the controversy over his successor that has raged ever since also epitomises a struggle for control of the $1.5bn in assets held by the Kagyu order, the richest in Tibetan Buddhism. With control of the Rumtek monastery embroiled in rival lawsuits, the New Delhi-based Karmapa has, not surprisingly, greeted the recent cash seizure as &quot;exposing&quot; his Chinese-appointed rival. Significantly, in contrast to its increasingly vituperative attacks on the Dalai Lama, China has not denounced (or de-recognised) its Karmapa, despite his flight to India signalling its failure to retain the loyalty of a supposed puppet. The Mandarin-speaking Ogyen Trinley Dorje, now 25, occasionally criticises the Chinese government, including its efforts &quot;to create this ethnic conflict&quot; in Tibet. Nevertheless, China has refrained from attacking him, making clear that it wants him to return eventually. And the ongoing Karmapa saga, with its shadowy politics and intrigue, could turn out to be only the opening act \u2013 a foretaste of what may come when two duelling Dalai Lamas emerge after the incumbent passes from the scene. \u2022 Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2011 \u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2011 because the original referred to the Karmapa as the Karmapa Lama.

Kesennuma, a fishing town on Japan&apos;s north-east Pacific coast, does a lucrative business in the staples of Japanese cuisine: tuna, flounder, octopus, crab, bonito, Pacific saury, seaweed and squid. But the trade in shark fins is its commercial lifeblood. The port, 250 miles north of Tokyo, accounts for 90% of Japan&apos;s shark fin trade and the promise of eating the country&apos;s best shark fin soup draws busloads of tourists every day in summer. In 2009, Kesennuma landed almost 14,000 tonnes of shark, worth just over \u00a52.4bn (\u00a317.9m): a decent-sized tailfin can fetch as much as \u00a510,000. The minimal threat sharks pose to humans is the overriding theme of the town&apos;s shark museum, while stalls at the port&apos;s market sell everything the animal has to give: dumplings, jerky, shark-skin bags and accessories, and salmon-shark hearts \u2013 a local speciality eaten raw. Few people outside Japan are aware of Kesennuma&apos;s contribution to the global trade in shark fins. And many among the town&apos;s 2,000 fishery workers would rather keep it that way as the Guardian discovered during a recent visit. We were asked to leave the port and film from a gantry reserved for tourists, while local officials turned down requests for comment. Our guide suggested, only half-jokingly, that we had been sent by Greenpeace. Workers, contending with near-freezing temperatures and noisy, hungry seabirds circling above, moved quickly along the lines of sharks removing their fins. Pools of blood were hosed away as quickly as they formed. Most of the shark fins handled at Kesennuma are taken to a nearby drying area \u2013 whose location is a closely guarded secret \u2013 and sold to upmarket restaurants in Tokyo and other big cities. A much smaller quantity is exported to Hong Kong and China, where the newly affluent have acquired a taste for Kesennuma shark fin. The fishery workers go to extraordinary lengths to pursue their prey. The biggest ships among the town&apos;s 130-strong fleet spend up to 50 days at sea, casting baited lines several miles in length along a stretch of ocean between Japan and Hawaii. But growing demand for shark fins, coupled with modern fishing methods, has caused a rapid decline in shark populations around the world, according to conservation groups. Many of the top catcher nations under-report their catches, in violation of international regulations. In a report released to coincide with a meeting of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization last month, the Washington-based Pew Environment Group said at least 73 million sharks were killed every year, primarily for their fins. &quot;Sharks play a critical role in the ocean environment,&quot; said Pew&apos;s global shark conservation manager, Jill Hepp. &quot;Where shark populations are healthy, marine life thrives. But where they have been overfished, ecosystems fall out of balance. &quot;Shark-catching countries must stand by their commitments and act now to conserve and protect these animals.&quot; The movement to turn shark fin soup into a culinary pariah is gathering pace. The British celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay highlighted the cruelty involved in finning \u2013 the practice of removing fins and discarding the body \u2013 in a recent documentary for Channel 4, while several Chinese restaurants in London have removed the soup from their menus. The blue sharks that comprise 80% of the shark catch at Kesennuma are listed as &quot;near threatened&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Its migratory habits make it difficult to gauge the exact population, but there is no doubt that catches are in decline. Japan caught about 65,000 tonnes of sharks just over 40 years ago, according to the country&apos;s fisheries agency; by 2009 that had almost halved to 35,000 tonnes. &quot;The number of sharks is definitely falling,&quot; says Kokichi Takeyama, an expert on Kesennuma&apos;s fishing industry who conducts tours of the port. &quot;In the old days the fishermen used to throw them away as bycatch, but now they recognise their commercial value.&quot; Japan&apos;s shark industry uses every part of the animal and so does not deserve to be targeted along with countries that catch them only for their fins, Takeyama argues. But that does nothing to protect shark populations, says Mayumi Takeda, co-founder of PangeaSeed, a shark conservation group in Tokyo. &quot;Whether or not consumers use every part of the shark does not safeguard them against extinction,&quot; she says. &quot;Just walk through the massive piles of juvenile sharks in Kesennuma and the picture becomes quite clear that this is the genocide of a species.&quot; Like other members of the species, the blue shark is slow to mature and produces few offspring. &quot;Should we wait to protect a species once it&apos;s on the verge of extinction, or act responsibly while we still have the chance?&quot; asks Takeda. Several countries, including the US, have taken steps to conserve shark populations, but she holds out little hope that Japan will follow suit. &quot;Many Japanese turn a blind eye to the problem and ocean conservation seems to be overlooked here,&quot; she says. &quot;And because of the efforts of conservationists in the southern ocean and Taiji, the Japanese media have spun these issues to appear to be the actions of eco-terrorists. But Japan&apos;s international scoresheet can&apos;t handle much more negative press.&quot; The people of Kesennuma, meanwhile, fear that media coverage of Japan&apos;s whaling and dolphin-hunting industries will put them under closer scrutiny. &quot;We have seen what happened with the whaling issue, and don&apos;t want the attention,&quot; said one resident, who asked not to be named. &quot;We just want to be left alone to get on with our jobs.&quot; Shark fishing worldwide 20 countries account for 80% of the global shark catch, according to the Pew Environment Group. The top catching nation is Indonesia, followed by India, Spain and Taiwan. Japan lies in 9th place, with an annual average catch of almost 25,000 tonnes. The IUCN&apos;s red list shows that 30% of all shark species are threatened or near threatened with extinction, and an internationally agreed plan to conserve sharks reached 10 years ago has had little effect. &quot;The fate of the world&apos;s sharks is in the hands of the world&apos;s top 20 shark catchers, most of which have failed to demonstrate what, if anything, they are doing to save these imperilled species,&quot; says Glenn Sant of the pressure group Traffic, which monitors the global trade in wildlife."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/feb/20/4", "publicationDate": "2011-02-20T20:01:08Z", "tags": ["Science"], "sentences": ["This bird forms a superspecies with the yellow-billed blue magpie (or gold-billed magpie), Urocissa flavirostris, and the Taiwan (or Formosan) blue magpie, Urocissa caerulea."], "title": "Mystery bird: red-billed blue magpie, Urocissa erythrorhyncha", "article": "Red-billed blue magpie, Urocissa erythrorhyncha (Protonym; Corvus erythrorynchus), also known as the red-billed magpie or the blue magpie, photographed in Hong Kong, China.

But there&apos;s still a chance to track down a conversation in Gamilaraay, or Southern Pomo \u2013 if you&apos;re prepared to trek to visit to one the few native Americans still speaking it in California. Of the 6,500 living languages currently being used around the world, around half are expected to be extinct by the end of this century. It was concern about the cultural and historical losses that result from a language disappearing that inspired the World Oral Literature Project, an online collection of some of the 3,500-plus &quot;endangered languages&quot; struggling for survival in the world. The heart of the project, run by Cambridge University, is a large database listing thousands of languages alongside details such as where they are spoken and by whom, plus audio clips. On the site, surfers can discover that Laghu was a language spoken in the Solomon Islands until it disappeared in 1984, Old Kentish Sign Language was a precursor to the modern-day version, and Gamilaraay is still used by the Kamilaroi tribe of New South Wales. The project is the brainchild of Mark Turin, 37, a research associate at Cambridge University&apos;s Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. He grew up in London speaking Dutch and English and had planned to study linguistics at university, but on a gap year in Nepal realised he was interested in &quot;what language unlocked, not just the nuts and bolts of linguistics&quot;, and switched to anthropology. &quot;We know very little about most of the world&apos;s languages, and an incredible amount about the histories and changes of a handful of western European languages,&quot; Turin explains. And he has devoted his academic career to trying to open up little-known languages. &quot;Most endangered languages are primarily oral, and are vehicles for the transmission of a great deal of oral culture,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s at risk of being lost when speakers abandon their languages in favour of regional, national or international tongues.&quot; So the World Oral Literature Project aims to document vanishing languages \u2013 and everything about the culture and society they convey \u2013 before they disappear. Its database used three major sources to collate the information about the disappearing languages, including Unesco&apos;s Atlas of the World&apos;s Languages in Danger. About 150 of its listed languages are in an &quot;extremely critical&quot; condition, where the number of known living speakers has slipped to single figures, or even just one. &quot;As soon as a scholar declares a language to be extinct, you get a phone call from someone furious who says &apos;my mother still speaks it&apos;,&quot; Turin says. &quot;But in a way, these corrections are all part of the process of drawing attention to the cause and the sense of urgency involved in careful documentation and description of endangered speech forms the world over.&quot; The project also provides funds for local fieldworkers in countries including Malawi, India, Mongolia and Colombia to collect data and recordings about little-spoken languages. In the past, Turin says, major collections of recordings were lost because they weren&apos;t deemed important. He sees the new site as a &quot;safe haven&quot; for fieldwork on languages that might otherwise be lost. &quot;The vast majority of tapes are just kept in dusty boxes, but to put them on our database we digitise and hopefully future-proof them,&quot; he adds. &quot;All manner of people have been getting in touch to give us their collections, including missionaries, retired scholars and community activists.&quot; One early donor was Reverend John Whitehorn, a former missionary and Cambridge linguist who lived with an indigenous community in Taiwan in the 1950s. &quot;When he came back to England, he walked into Cambridge&apos;s Museum of Anthropology and said, &apos;I&apos;ve got books, textiles and tape recordings, are you interested?&apos; The museum took it all apart from the recordings because they didn&apos;t know what to do with them,&quot; Turin explains. &quot;He went home and stored his collection around the house in plastic carrier bags, where they stayed until he walked into my office with the bags under his arm, and asked, &apos;do you want them now?&apos; The tapes are brilliant, with songs and interviews and linguistic information that might otherwise have disappeared.&quot; The database is currently updated exclusively by academics (though users are encouraged to send in contributions), but Turin hopes that it will ultimately become a Wikipedia-style web 2.0 project &quot;that people want to contribute to&quot;, with user uploads, recordings and discussion to help keep languages alive. To that aim, Turin organises lectures and workshops for linguists, librarians, academics and members of the public to discuss the best strategies for collecting and protecting languages and their research. But he worries that, in academia, funding pressures mean the importance of languages is being overlooked. &quot;These days, students are in a huge rush to finish their PhDs due to time and funding requirements,&quot; he says. &quot;They often don&apos;t have the time to develop a linguistic awareness for the people they&apos;re studying, and have to rely on interpreters and translators. But it&apos;s just not the same.&quot; Turin is used to hearing sceptics dismiss the research. &quot;I get a lot of people saying that they think this work is pointless as all minority languages that have no utility are better off dying off anyway \u2013 a kind of social Darwinian position,&quot; he says. &quot;But I usually ask them whether they feel the same about all the old churches and buildings that Heritage Lottery money is helping to restore \u2013 or the plight of species around the world. Our work means we&apos;re helping not only endangered languages to stay with us, but all the culture and history that they denote.&quot;Watch the video www.oralliterature.org/database "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/22/happiness-green-china", "publicationDate": "2011-02-22T10:33:00Z", "tags": ["Green economy", "China", "Ethical and green living", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The GDP figure in Guangdong, one of China&apos;s most developed provinces, is now close to that of the four Asian Tigers \u2013 Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan \u2013 which themselves have entered the ranks of developed nations."], "title": "Be happy, says Chinese province in new five-year plan", "article": "As China&apos;s growth figures have rocketed, criticism of the country&apos;s &quot;GDP first&quot; approach has also been rising. That criticism is now starting to influence policy: in January, the Communist Party branch in Guangdong, a province in southern China, specified a &quot;Happy Guangdong&quot; as one of its goals for the 12th Five-Year Plan period, which runs from 2011 to 2015. It aims to achieve this target by boosting domestic demand, innovation, workforce development, regional coordination, green development and &quot;harmonious sharing&quot;.  Guangdong&apos;s proposal won swift approval from civil society, with both the media and the public praising the &quot;Happy Guangdong&quot; concept. It is clear that the Chinese people \u2013 particularly those in more developed regions \u2013 have come to realise the limitations of a system where, once a certain degree of growth has been achieved, GDP is still prioritised above all else. They hope that broader indices can be used to promote economic and social development and increase the well-being of China&apos;s citizens. At the end of the 1970s, China&apos;s per-capita GDP was only US$290 (1,906 yuan). Housing was basic and people struggled to survive. Private bathrooms, personal transportation, refrigerators, televisions, cassette players and telephones were all part of daily life in the United States and Europe, but remained an unreachable dream for most Chinese people. A low level of economic development was preventing the pursuit of happiness And so China declared war on poverty. With economic growth as its central battle strategy, it went all out in pursuit of higher GDP. Thirty years later, China has overtaken Japan to become the world&apos;s second largest economy and has per-capita GDP of about US$3,000 (19,700 yuan). Challenges to basic survival have been met, while some areas have become wealthy and modern. The GDP figure in Guangdong, one of China&apos;s most developed provinces, is now close to that of the four Asian Tigers \u2013 Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan \u2013 which themselves have entered the ranks of developed nations.  The dream of a better life among ordinary people has driven this economic miracle. And economic growth has become the Communist Party&apos;s most important source of legitimacy.  Once an individual&apos;s material needs have been met, further consumption provides diminishing returns of happiness. For a nation, it is the same \u2013 once economic development provides subsistence, or even a comfortable existence, for its people, further GDP growth does not noticeably increase well-being. Sociological, psychological and economic research has shown this to be the case, and our own experiences confirm it. When issues of survival have been dealt with nationwide and when many regions have achieved economic modernisation and comfortable living standards, the additional happiness generated by further economic growth begins to fall.  Moreover, the narrow pursuit of GDP growth can actually damage the factors that create happiness. For example, many parts of China have welcomed polluting industries for the sake of economic growth, resulting in air and water contamination, higher rates of illness \u2013 and a decline in day-to-day well-being. What is the point of this kind of economic growth? This question is not unique to China. Some nations have gone so far as to propose replacing GDP with Gross National Happiness (GNH) \u2013 easy to calculate by combining indices measuring GDP, public health, social welfare, culture and environmental quality. Bhutan has already adopted the idea of GNH into national policymaking, leading it to cap the number of tourists allowed to visit the country each year in order to limit environmental and social impacts. As a result, Bhutan&apos;s per-capita GDP is low, but it has become, many argue, the world&apos;s &quot;happiest nation&quot;.  In China, Guangdong has taken the lead in moving away from GDP-focused development and stressing that a happy society is not simply a rich one: it also needs a clean environment, secure civil rights, social justice and the provision of public and cultural goods. The implications of this are worth considering.  But while the idea of Gross National Happiness is now taken seriously, its implementation in China still faces obstacles. Take one component \u2013 environmental indices \u2013 as an example. Over recent years, China has seen continuous reports of heavy-metal pollution, algal blooms, sprawling landfills and air pollution. But the environmental authorities have used reported reductions in chemical oxygen demand (a measure of water pollution) and carbon-dioxide emissions to claim that the environment is improving. Even Zhang Lijun, vice minister for environmental protection, admits that there are problems with using those two measures to evaluate the quality of China&apos;s environment. Meanwhile, using their own cameras, Beijing residents have shown that the city&apos;s &quot;blue-sky days&quot; are much rarer than official statistics claim. Against this background, it is easy to understand why official environmental data gets better every year, while the public&apos;s sense of well-being diminishes. Non-GDP indices are being used for appearance&apos;s sake only. Meanwhile the GDP-first approach remains popular, particularly with local governments under increasing financial pressure. Short-term measures designed to boost GDP, such as selling land, speculating on property markets and supporting polluting industries, are constantly employed.  Why, when the extra well-being provided by further economic growth is falling, is China still pursuing GDP at the expense of other forms of social development? Besides the fact that there is still room for growth, the most important driving force is the system for assessing the performance of officials. Over the past 30 years, China&apos;s market reforms, combined with a concentration of power in government hands, have created a form of economic development led by local government. This has made economic growth the most important measure of an official&apos;s success and, to a certain extent, distorted his or her public-service role.  In the 1980s, the Chinese Communist Party&apos;s source of legitimacy shifted from ideology to economic record. Although ideological education remained significant, the party&apos;s right to rule was increasingly drawn from actual economic growth. This formed the core of a system for assessing local government performance, evaluating results and determining promotions that, over three decades, has become entrenched. But society has developed faster than the political system, and China has been left with a rigid assessment framework that is ill-suited to the needs of a rapidly changing society.  Another issue is that, under the existing system, local government and local business come together to form a powerful interest group that supports GDP growth over competing demands, such as environmental protection. Its members have interests to protect, organisational ability, financial backing and, in some cases, media control. Meanwhile, the needs of the environment are advocated by newer groups, which are both scattered and weak. Sometimes their voices are heard in the media, but they are no match for powerful lobby groups. This is why many polluting projects continue despite objections from numerous environmental organisations.  Everyone knows that protecting the environment is a good thing. And everyone knows that money does not equal happiness. But the system nonetheless results in a chronic focus on GDP. Merely advocating happiness indices will not solve the problem. As long as local government officials seek good evaluations \u2013 and those evaluations are carried out by superiors from higher levels of government, without public involvement \u2013 GDP will remain the most direct and effective measure of success. And, for officials, ignoring public demands to prioritise well-being over GDP growth will continue to make perfect sense.  The GDP chase is the product of an outdated method of assessing government performance. Calling for officials to pay more attention to well-being without changing that system will make happiness indices nothing more than window-dressing. Only reforming that system and letting the public participate in the evaluation of local government will force officials out of the GDP rut and allow the creation of a &quot;Happy China&quot;. \u2022 Tang Hao is deputy professor at South China Normal University, a Fulbright scholar and a columnist."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/feb/22/inside-guardian-weekly-25feb-deveney", "publicationDate": "2011-02-22T15:56:30Z", "tags": [], "sentences": ["Away from the Middle East, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake slams New Zealand, national forests become a priority in Rwanda, Taiwan looks to America for more military hardware and a uranium rush threatens the Grand Canyon."], "title": "Inside the 25 February edition", "article": "We try something different in this issue, leading the Weekly with a fully formed analysis of events in the Arab world from David Hirst, former Middle East correspondent for the Guardian and the author of several books on the region.

Her name was Ann Scotcher, it&apos;s one of the few photos I have of her, and I love it. The picture was taken by my mum, aged 16, in the late 1950s, both sharing a lighter moment. But things weren&apos;t so easy for my nan. Widowed and in a loveless marriage (her first husband and father of her two young children had died young), her life was hard. Welfare as we know it today did not exist, so, like a lot of women in her predicament, she married again in order to survive. One day she opened her door to a young man selling bread. He charmed her and, in time, she decided to run away with him, leaving the second husband and, much harder, leaving her two children with her mother. Her family disowned her and she had to pretend to be married to avoid social stigma. Either he had some very good qualities so she could have made such a decision or life at home was intolerable, or possibly both. She had two more children with him (he was a soldier, a bread man, a boxer, a home guard volunteer during the war and a postman until retirement; and in his\u00a0spare time he was a drinker and a compulsive gambler). Her first two children would visit when they were older, although there was some bitterness and pain with these visits. I look at this photo, and I feel sorry that she wasn&apos;t born in more forgiving times. Today she could keep her children and not have to marry for survival. The most she would suffer is disapproval for claiming benefits. I thank her for making such a brave, heartbreaking decision. I wouldn&apos;t exist if she had not.

I&apos;m 22, barely a year out of uni, an aspiring actor with his first (fringe) theatre job, and I&apos;ve just met the love of my life. He&apos;s 15 years older than me, an impoverished jewellery designer living just off Portobello Road. He&apos;s handsome, sexy, intelligent and kind, and from the off we know we&apos;re made for each other. Really. This man I was going to be with for\u00a0ever. I bought cornflowers for him from the market one sunny Saturday morning and he said they were the colour of my eyes. He wasn&apos;t feeling too good, so he went back to bed while I spring- cleaned the windows (had to let all that sunlight in) and sang along to the Eurythmics on the radio. I felt like the song was written for me and I can still picture myself, doing such a mundane job yet feeling ecstatic, like I was in heaven. Six months later he was dead, after a drawn-out agonising illness, that horrible new disease called Aids. I was bereft, and hoped it wouldn&apos;t be long until I was next. More than 25 years later and I&apos;m still here. I&apos;ve got a lovely partner, a lovely family, yet tears roll down my face as I write this. Yes, because I still miss you, David, but more because I miss the way I felt then. Every time I hear this song, I try to remember that feeling, but I can&apos;t really.

Adrian Hardwicke We love to eat: Red azuki bean nian gao Ingredients 300g glutinous rice flour 200g red azuki bean paste 135g brown sugar 350g water 40g vegetable oil Pour the sugar and half of the water into a pot and melt the sugar completely, then turn off the heat. Pour the flour and remaining water into a bowl and stir until well mixed. Add the vegetable oil, sugar water and red azuki bean paste into the same bowl and stir until uniform. Pour the batter into a pot. Gently stir and cook the batter until it has a custard texture, then turn off the heat. Pour the half-cooked batter into a cake mould and steam in hot boiling water for 35 minutes until firm. My sister and I would eat this rice cake straight off the steamer as we like the sweet, sticky and messy structure on our hands and chopsticks. My grandma would let the cake cool completely as it is much easier to cut and serve. I would get my mum to take this back to our house and deep batter fry them or pan fry them, which gives them a burnt-crispy, chewy texture. Every Chinese New Year my grandma would steam her red azuki bean nian gao to bring good luck to her family. She hoped that eating her nian gao would allow us to raise ourselves higher in the coming year. Nian means sticky texture, and sounds the same as the symbol meaning &quot;year&quot;. Gao means cake, which sounds the same as the symbol meaning &quot;high&quot;. Her adding the red azuki bean gives a reddish colour to the cake, which also brings good luck. This is just one of the many variations of nian gao made throughout the Chinese populations. As Grandma celebrated her 100th birthday on the third day after Chinese New Year, I thought I would steam her favourite nian gao to celebrate her lifelong journey from the end of the Chinese Qing dynasty, through the first and second world wars to her migration and settlement in the United States in the early 70s and now into the era of technology. I was planning to bake the nian gao instead \u2013 the alternative western way; however, I&apos;m afraid she would not recognise it. She has Alzheimer&apos;s disease. But my dad has the same birthday as Grandma, so every Chinese New Year we would always celebrate both of their birthdays together.

Choosing to pursue your &quot;plan B&quot; is a bold and often transformative decision that many adults are too afraid to commit to. But The Jewel Hunter [ISBN 978-1903657164; WILDGuides Ltd, UK; 2010; Amazon UK; Amazon US] is the real-life story of one man who finally overcame inertia to devote eleven months of his life to his &quot;plan B&quot;: his obsession to see all living species of a small jewel-like songbird, the pittas.    At 45 years old, Chris Gooddie is a proper British professional. He&apos;s gotten a good education, he works hard as a sales director in the publishing industry, he lives in London and is, according to all appearances, busily climbing the corporate ladder. Of course, like most of us, he does occasionally have his moments of inexplicable exuberance, such as when he was searching for a snowfinch in the French Pyrenees and almost froze to death whilst dressed as a pantomime cat.  Gooddie also daydreams a lot, perhaps more than most professionals. One of his favorite daydreams was a secret ambition he&apos;d been nurturing for much of his adult life. Gooddie is a closeted treasure hunter. His treasure? Birds.  But not just any bird: Gooddie dreams of pittas. There are 32 species of pittas in the world and Gooddie wanted to see them all before he becomes extinct, or they do. This seems easy enough until you learn that only two or three people have ever seen all of the pitta species in their entire lifetimes.  But this nearly universal oversight is not because pittas are little brown birds. Sometimes known as &quot;jewel thrushes&quot;, pittas are medium-sized roundish songbirds with soft voices, long legs and a nearly non-existant stub tail. They bounce around in dense and shadowy tropical rain forests, their presence occasionally betrayed when a stray sunbeam finds their stunning gleaming plumage. They are, in the common vernacular, really fucking cute.  One species had particularly captured Gooddie&apos;s imagination; Gurney&apos;s pitta, Pitta gurneyi. This spectacular species only occurs in lowland rain forests of peninsular Thailand and southern Myanmar (Burma). For 34 years, this secretive little jewel had been thought extinct until it was rediscovered in 1986. This news captivated Gooddie. He even competed in two fund-raising London marathons to help save this species, whose entire Thailand population was thought to consist of just 20 pairs of birds.  So knowing this, we cannot be surprised when one evening, Gooddie found himself in his office once again, daydreaming about pittas.  &quot;Animals are the best things in the world&quot; Gooddie doodled instead of working on yet another computer spreadsheet.  &quot;Birds are the best animalsPittas are the best birdsGurney&apos;s pitta is the best pitta&quot; And just like that, Gooddie closed his spreadsheets, typed his resignation letter, cleared his desk and left.  Gooddie turned his back on a \u00a390,000/year job to devote the next 11 months to his dream. He traveled more than 200,000 kilometers through Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan, Sabah, Vietnam, The Philippines, Indonesia, northern Australia, Sri Lanka, Manus Island, The Solomon Islands, Uganda and Zambia, spent almost \u00a330,000, lost 13 kilos, met many interesting people and ate a lot of fabulous cooking. Along the way, Gooddie ran into an angry sun bear, curious elephants, poisonous snakes, scorpions, numerous leeches and gazillions of mosquitoes. But he also saw more than one-fifth of all the known species of birds in the world. Most importantly, Gooddie got the opportunity to chase the objects of his passion through the tropics. But even the author is amazed at the birds&apos; wiliness. He writes:   ...ALL Blue-rumped Pittas [sic] I have ever seen (in Vietnam) have approached to within two metres without me seeing a single feather on their sneaky behinds. They will be watching from a hidden vantage point closer than you think humanly possible. That&apos;s because whilst it&apos;s impossible for a human, it&apos;s eminently possible for a pitta, which is able to take the subway, or glide through the forest without touching the floor. Despite their typically rather chubby frames, they are able to flatten themselves behind single blades of grass. They can travel through space-time without leaving a ripple in the continuum in a way that even Stephen Hawking cannot explain. [p. 37]  Black and white maps sprinkled throughout the book help the reader keep up with the author&apos;s international journey, and most maps include a drawing of the pitta species that the author was chasing. I do wish there had been a summary map at the beginning of the book showing the complete journey or, barring that, each detailed chapter map should have included a smaller inset map showing the nearby land masses for those who are not familiar with this region of the world.  The book also includes 138 colour photographs of people encountered, places visited and birds seen. These photographs, taken by the author, are presented in chronological order in special insets. The fifth and final section of photographic insets (&quot;The Treasure Chest&quot;) are the author&apos;s pictures of pittas. Considering how challenging it is to simply see pittas, it&apos;s surprising that Gooddie managed to photograph most of the species. As you might expect, some of these photographs are blurry or capture a distant jewel-like pitta peering over a large green leaf blob in the foreground blocking most of the camera shutter. But these poor quality photos are few and they nicely reflect both the author&apos;s humorous conversational writing and the adventures he had.  Even though I enjoyed the book, I was frustrated by the author&apos;s superficial discussion of deforestation and illegal logging, which pose tremendous threats to all wildlife throughout the coastal and lowland forests throughout southeast Asia and the Pacific. I think Gooddie could have made his story stronger (and provided a richer explanation for his &quot;pitta passion&quot;) by including one chapter about these issues, combining information from the conservation literature with his on-the-ground experiences. However, that said, the author&apos;s interest appears genuine: a percentage of the profits from the sale of his book go to BirdLife International, one of several organisations that are working to protect the last of the pittas&apos; habitat.  This 424-page trade paperback is printed on heavy paper and bound in a heavy paper cover. The cover photograph is nice, but oddly, the colour is not properly balanced. The chapters were named for the places that Gooddie visited, but because this book was focused on seeing the pittas, I think the pitta species seen should have been included (perhaps parenthetically?) in the chapter name, too -- either that, or there should have been an index of pittas seen. Throughout the book, Gooddie demonstrates that he is a rabid &quot;lister&quot; who keeps detailed lists of all sorts of things, so it only makes sense that his trip bird list should also have been included (it wasn&apos;t). A few cut-and-paste errors detracted from the story, but otherwise, this book was well edited and produced.  Despite its few flaws, this rollicking tale is an engaging and compelling memoir that bird watchers, nature lovers and fans of travel literature will enjoy. This book is a must-read for those who (like me) are nurturing their own dream to go on a tropical birding expedition, and is essential reading for anyone who nurses their own secret &quot;plan B&quot;.  . Chris Gooddie has a degree in English from the University of Nottingham and works in sales in the music and publishing industry. He is a marathoner and a lifelong birdwatcher who lives in London with his wife, Maxine, and a cat named Jason. The Jewel Hunter is his first book.

But what does the world&apos;s toughest industrial machine do following total world domination? It&apos;s going to go shopping. Like the early &quot;tiger&quot; economies, China&apos;s industrial miracle is based on high personal savings mobilised through a state-directed banking system into the factories, highways and ports that are the backbone of an export economy. But the Asian tigers made up only slightly more than 1% of the global population. China is 20% of the world&apos;s population, and is simply too big to continue with the tiger model. In future, the market for &quot;Made in China&quot; goods won&apos;t be Americans filling the trunks of their Chevrolets at Wal-Mart; it will be the Chinese stocking up at a Vanguard supermarket in Guangdong and squeezing it into the boot of their shiny new BYD. After China&apos;s industrial revolution comes the consumer revolution. On the 38th floor of a Hong Kong tower block, Frank Lai, chief financial officer of China Resources, sets out his vision. Vanguard is just one of the brands his company controls. The part-state-owned group is China&apos;s biggest supermarket operator with 2,300 stores and more than 150,000 workers. &quot;Our ambition is for China Resources to be the largest retailer in China,&quot; he says. Yet the Chinese supermarket business is still in its infancy. In Britain 63% of our grocery spending goes through the big five supermarket groups. In China it&apos;s just 7%, but Lai is confident it is heading the same way as Britain and America. Tesco thinks so, too. This week Britain&apos;s biggest retailer said it is pushing ahead with a joint venture to develop as many as 80 shopping malls across China, each anchored by a hypermarket, adding up to a \u00a35bn investment. But Lai is serenely unperturbed by competition from the likes of Tesco, Carrefour and Wal-Mart. &quot;The more successful a foreign company is, the less successful it is in China. When they are so successful at home they can&apos;t change their corporate culture to suit the Chinese shopper.&quot; Perhaps he is referring to Carrefour, whose early expansion into China saw it open 182 hypermarkets. But in recent months it has begun to close some, especially in &quot;second tier&quot; cities, amid intense price competition. Seeing off Carrefour or Tesco is just one of Lai&apos;s goals. Another is creating a beverage company on a scale that could eventually dwarf Diageo or even Coca-Cola. The best-selling brand of beer on this planet is one you&apos;ve probably never heard of. It&apos;s called Snow and last year China Resources brewed 3.1m kilolitres of the stuff, toppling Tsingtao as number one in the China market following a price war (it sells for 18p a bottle) that has crushed margins but sent volumes soaring. It has also entered a deal with Japan&apos;s giant Kirin beverage company to develop non-alcoholic drinks for the China market, although one crucial fact dominates their partnership: China Resources is in control. Like virtually every other state-owned company that enters into a joint venture with a western or Japanese company, the Chinese partner controls at least 51% of the deal.     Swiss watchmakers actively target the Chinese market. Photograph: Str/AFP/Getty Images    Only in one sector do western brands dominate and control: luxury goods. Hengdeli is another one of those Chinese companies you may never have heard of, yet it sells more watches and timepieces than any other retailer in the world. And 90% of them come from Switzerland. In 2009 China, despite a reputation as the world&apos;s factory for fakes, overhauled the USA as the world&apos;s number one luxury watch market. Hengdeli has 330 stores, mostly in mainland China but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and says it plans to have at least 1,000. It is the exclusive distributor for brands such as Rolex, and manager Werner Schuppisser cites one sale in mainland China last year in which a customer paid $4m for a Rolex: &quot;It had a lot of stones [diamonds] on it.&quot; Swiss watchmakers, keenly aware of the Chinese as their biggest customers, now produce designs exclusively for the Chinese market. Hong Kong, where sales tax is zero, has become &quot;the shopping centre of the world for luxury goods&quot;, Schuppisser says. Many are cash purchasers from the mainland. Stories abound in Hong Kong of mainlanders who come to the former colony with suitcases of cash. Some of it goes on consumer goods, but much of it heads into the city&apos;s frenzied property maket. Critics warn of a Chinese property and consumer bubble that, when it pops, could herald the financial crisis, part two. Easy lending and ultra-low interest rates have sparked a construction boom that is producing ghost malls and estates in the style of Ireland \u2013 just 100 times bigger. &quot;China has more than its fair share of failed shopping malls,&quot; says a recent note from independent brokerage and investment group CLSA Asia-Pacific. At a meeting with one of China&apos;s top banking figures (he preferred to remain off the record), there is talk of crunch time for China&apos;s state-owned banks, although not for another year or two. They are financing vast infrastructure spending while nursing potentially huge non-performing loan books. Privately, he says he thought the Hong Kong property market was a bubble three years ago, but since then it has continued to grow at 15%-30% a year. The reason? Property buyers can still access new mortgages at just 0.9%. Income multiples stretch to as much as 18 times salary, a figure that would make even Northern Rock blanch. When inflation is running at 5%, and wage growth more than that, borrowing money is effectively free. But at Neptune Investment Management, whose managing director Robin Geffen was instrumental in blocking a \u00a325bn China deal by Britain&apos;s Prudential last year, they are remarkably sanguine about the outlook for the country. Chief economist James Dowey says China&apos;s private consumption share of GDP at 35.6% is abnormally low, even for an emerging market. Wages, at 48% of GDP, are far below the western average of two-thirds. What Dowey expects is a normalisation as China becomes much more like the west. The Communist Party&apos;s latest five-year plan talks of a &quot;Harmonious Society&quot; spreading the tangible benefits of growth across the country and towards consumers. This week Premier Wen Jiabao announced that China&apos;s growth will decelerate to an average of 7% a year between between now and 2017, with spending directed away from the coastal export cities and industrial overcapacity, and into the lesser developed eastern part of the country. Along the way the country will be buffeted by price inflation and wage disputes, Dowey warns. But out of it will emerge an economy where Made in China is not just sold abroad, but bought at home too. &quot;We believe this is a compelling time to buy into the China story,&quot; he says.

The largely rubber-stamp parliament, which opens on Saturday, will discuss the country&apos;s social and economic aims for the next five years. The rise in spending will fuel concerns among rival powers about China&apos;s increasing might. They are already concerned about its apparently tougher line on territorial disputes in areas such as the South China Sea, and its investment in new technology such as a stealth fighter jet. In 2010 spending rose at its lowest rate for years, by 7.5%, to 532bn yuan. Li told a news conference: &quot;China&apos;s defence spending is relatively low by world standards. China has always paid attention to restraining defence spending.&quot; Many analysts believe China spends more than it states publicly. US military spending has doubled in real terms since 2001 and although the Obama administration has vowed to cut spending over the next five years, it has requested a Pentagon base budget alone of $553bn (\u00a3340bn) for 2012. India also announced a rise in its annual military spending this week by about 11.6%, to 1.64tn rupees (\u00a322.4bn). Experts suggested the jump was intended to counter China&apos;s growing strength. Professor Huang Jing, a north Asia security expert at Singapore&apos;s Lee Kuan Yew school for public policy, said there were often substantial increases in China&apos;s military budget \u2013 usually including a rise in officers&apos; salaries \u2013 when it was preparing for a change of leadership. Its leaders also felt they were entering a period of uncertainty, with domestic challenges and upcoming leadership contests in countries such as the US, Japan and India, he said. &quot;Leaders will have less political capital to spend on foreign affairs, and foreign policy tends to be more expendable for political capital at home, so I think all of them will be tougher on foreign affairs.&quot; Huang said China&apos;s military buildup began in the mid-90s as it became concerned Taiwan would seek legal as well as de facto independence. &quot;The defence industry is a kind of machine: once you start it, you cannot slow it down. 2010 to 2050 are going to see a dramatic expansion of Chinese military power,&quot; he predicted. &quot;You also have to take into consideration that China&apos;s military seems to have become more influential in decision-making, or they at least voice their concerns louder than before.&quot; Xu Guangyu, director of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, said the budget was &quot;not really high&quot; given the size of the army. He said the country&apos;s five-year plan, which focuses on raising living standards, will require salary and welfare improvements for the 2.3 million personnel, in part to offset the effects of inflation. &quot;The other reason is that the cost for military equipment is going up, especially for high-tech weapons.&quot; He predicted growth would slow again next year. Ni Lexiong, a defence expert at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, said the increase reflected closer military cooperation between the US, Japan, South Korea and other countries in the region. He also pointed to Beijing&apos;s need to deal with new threats to its citizens and assets overseas.

Oil prices are surging, making the Bank of England fretful about inflation. Unemployment is rising at the same time as real incomes are being squeezed. Consumer confidence is weak. The second oil shock in two years has wrecked the government&apos;s plan for economic recovery, which is based loosely on the structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) imposed by the International Monetary Fund on developing countries. Under a formal SAP, a struggling poor country running a big trade deficit would offer fiscal austerity in return for favourable borrowing terms. Lower interest rates would lead to a lower exchange rate, boosting production and exports. The domestic part of the economy would be squeezed hard. Greece and Ireland have had modern versions of SAPs imposed on them in recent months; the UK has designed its own hair-shirt policy in which a four-year deficit reduction plan is meant to keep the financial markets sweet and allow Threadneedle Street to keep money cheap. George Osborne is wrong to say that there is no alternative to the government&apos;s plan to eliminate the &quot;structural&quot; part of the budget deficit in this parliament, the bit that will not go away even when the economy has fully recovered from the effects of the 2008-09 recession. Nobody knows for sure how much of the deficit is structural and how much cyclical, and there is no law of economics that says the public finances have to be repaired within a specific time period. As Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, has noted, they are taking a much more measured approach to deficit reduction in the United States. But the chancellor is right to argue that the problems of the UK economy pre-date the formation of the coalition last May. The importance of the financial services sector meant Britain was bound to have a particularly nasty recession when the banks started to go belly-up. Labour did nothing during its 13 years in power to counter the growing stranglehold over the economy exerted by the City since the Big Bang reforms of 1986. Unreformed Mervyn King warned at the weekend that another financial crisis is brewing. The financial sector remains unreformed, and many of the practices evident in the bubble years \u2013 such as speculation in high-yielding but risky investments \u2013 are back. Predictably, the Bank of England governor&apos;s comments were greeted with the usual riposte from the City: we are a centre of excellence for the UK but highly mobile. If you mess with us, we&apos;ll up sticks and leave the country. At this point, ministers normally back off. They do a rapid audit of the British economy and note that there is not much to it apart from a booming financial services sector, a bloated housing market (currently in the doldrums), a large public sector about to be pared back and the residue of an industrial base in which only two sectors \u2013 pharma and defence \u2013 could remotely be considered global players. Taking action that may hinder the expansion of one of the country&apos;s few centres of excellence seems far too big a gamble. It will be a brave chancellor who heeds King&apos;s warnings and ensures that the banks are no longer &quot;too big to fail&quot;. Yet a failure to act will mean that there will be no let-up in the boom-bust cycles that have bedevilled Britain for the past 40 years, and the deep structural problems in the economy will go unresolved. Two perspectives from the developing world may help explain why this is so. The first is a phenomenon known as Dutch disease, in which a country discovers it has bountiful supplies of a natural resource, such as oil or diamonds. The name comes from the experience of the Netherlands, after it found a huge gasfield in the 1950s. At first, the windfall is seen as a great boon, a way to boost growth and generate employment. But eventually the discovery is seen as a curse, because it leads to hot money flooding into the country, an increase in the value of the currency and a decline in manufacturing. Under the last Labour government, the City was a virulent form of Dutch disease. London, as one of the world&apos;s main financial centres, attracted investment funds from all over the world. Hot money flows led to a higher exchange rate, which crippled manufacturing. The stronger pound also kept the lid on inflation and kept interest rates low, creating the conditions for excessive personal borrowing and an asset-price spiral. When the bubble inevitably burst there was a big mess to clear up. This is a familiar pattern for the UK. There are periods \u2013 the late 1970s and the mid-1990s \u2013 when in the aftermath of a crash, stringent fiscal policy is used to rebalance the economy towards exports and manufacturing, but history suggests that they don&apos;t last for long. Sooner or later the credit tap is turned back on and another cycle begins, with the imbalances in the economy \u2013 between the City and manufacturing and between London and the rest of the UK \u2013 even more pronounced. Disease King&apos;s plan to break up the banks would be a start in curing Britain&apos;s Dutch disease. But there is also a case for the Bank, in its new role as the City&apos;s watchdog, to be given tools that would allow it to discriminate between lending for productive purposes and lending for speculation. If the government was serious about rebalancing the economy, it would keep control of the banks taken into public ownership and use them to invest in sectors of the economy seen as important for the future. This is where the second lesson from the developing world applies. Imagine for a moment Britain, not as a developed nation, but as the equivalent of Japan in the 1950s or Taiwan in the 1970s. A developing nation, in the UK&apos;s position, would decide which sectors it was going to specialise in and then provide them with all the support it could muster. The banking system would be the servant of industry, not its master, and there would be an industrial policy that protected fledgling industries in their early years of development. Are there any signs of this happening? Not really. There was talk of plans for a low-carbon economy being fleshed out this week, but so far the government has been all talk and little action. Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the world&apos;s biggest advertising group, said last week that Britain was now in the third tier of the global economy. Promotion does not look likely any time soon."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/09/chinese-love-clarks-shoes", "publicationDate": "2011-03-09T07:59:01Z", "tags": ["Life and style", "Fashion", "Women's shoes", "Men's fashion", "UK news"], "sentences": ["Tsung Chen and Zarni Chen, both 33, originally from Taiwan and now living in Surrey, have come here for a day trip."], "title": "How the Chinese fell in love with Clarks shoes", "article": "Buckingham Palace. Bath. Stonehenge. Clarks Village. The final destination may not trip off the tongue, but, this spring, organised bus-loads of Chinese tourists will start to pull up in the small town of Street to satisfy the Chinese appetite for the classic sensible British shoe. The arrival of the big-spending tourists at Clarks Village, standing on the once derelict site of the old Clarks shoe factory in Somerset, a county usually bypassed by holidaymakers hurtling towards the familiar delights of Devon and Cornwall, is particularly exciting for local tourism bosses. The factory shopping centre, which sells a range of discounted goods from high street brands including Clarks, Next, Nike and Monsoon, is the leading free attraction in the West Country, drawing 4.1 million visitors each year. Boarded- up high streets may be a depressing feature of this economic downturn but in Clarks Village, which opened in 1993, all 95 shops are occupied. This under-the-radar success could teach other communities useful lessons about redevelopment and economic revival through tourism, but it is also replete with bitter ironies. Apart from lending its name to the shopping centre, Clarks, the biggest shoe brand in the world, has little to do with the success of Clarks Village. Its shoes are in fact now made in China, India, Brazil and Vietnam but not in Britain, after the site and the Village brand was sold. So the Chinese are flying to the site where Clarks used to make shoes to buy shoes that are actually made in China and sold in a shopping centre not owned by Clarks. This is globalisation&apos;s very own coals- to-Newcastle. Clarks started making shoes in Street in 1825 when James Clark realised he and his brother, Cyrus, could make slippers from the offcuts of their sheepskin rug business. Still in private hands, with ownership spread among descendants of the family dynasty, Clarks now boasts a global turnover of \u00a31.17bn, and sells shoes in 160 countries. It is known for its sturdy, comfy adult footwear and sensible, well-fitting children&apos;s shoes. But the desert boot (now branded, alongside other designs such as the Wallabee, as a Clarks Original) continues to have classic appeal, and is particularly popular among musicians. Florence Welch, Nick Cave, Bob Dylan, Dizzee Rascal and Robbie Williams have all been spotted wearing them, while Jamaican dancehall star Vybz Kartel has even written three songs in praise of Clarks. Most of the company&apos;s shops are in the UK and North America but this year it is expanding in key markets, particularly in Germany and Holland. It is also stepping up in China, which saw a 22% increase in business in the 12 months to February 2010. This year, Clarks will add 100 new stores to its 1,000 around the world, including its first in India. Street would be an unremarkable little place were it not for Millfield, the public school based in the old Clark family mansion, and Clarks, which physically and emotionally dominates the town. The company still has its headquarters here, by the old factory chimney that towers over the industrial buildings; murals on walls celebrate the shoemakers; the slightly run-down high street is dwarfed by the shopping village next door. Locals point out the two swimming pools and theatre built with Clarks&apos;s largesse. By the standards of modern malls, Clarks Village is lovely, even on the bleakest of March days. Its paved, pedestrian streets possess a patina of history and its shops are placed around a quaint square, a carousel and stalls from which waft the aroma of fried onions and hot chocolate. When Jeff Banks opened his shop here, he compared it, not completely outlandishly, to London&apos;s Covent Garden. Come April, the Village will be even prettier thanks to an influx of hanging baskets. But it is still just a shopping centre. &quot;Factory&quot; or &quot;outlet&quot; shopping arrived in Britain from the United States, peddling end-of-line wares from high-street chain stores. Clarks Village&apos;s big brand names must, according to their leases, sell discounted, remaindered items (although, increasingly, major retailers produce &quot;made for outlet&quot; items). While I can&apos;t see any Clarks&apos; Originals in its shop, there are some good shoes; the stock in other stores looks much like any ordinary shopping centre. Tsung Chen and Zarni Chen, both 33, originally from Taiwan and now living in Surrey, have come here for a day trip. Why not go closer to home, to Oxford Street or Bluewater in Kent? &quot;It&apos;s quiet and the air is very fresh here,&quot; says Chen. &quot;It&apos;s easier to shop, with very convenient parking. The prices are cheap and it&apos;s good quality.&quot; So far, Chinese visitors to Clarks Village tend to be expats or holidaymakers visiting their children at nearby boarding schools. But organised groups of Chinese tourists will arrive on test tours next month. &quot;I&apos;m confident it will become quite popular very quickly,&quot; says Stephanie Cheng, managing director of China Holidays, a London-based tour operator for Chinese tourists. Cheng has been courted by the Somerset Tourism Association, which is keen to attract tourists from abroad. Tourism brings \u00a31bn in turnover and 33,000 jobs to the county but Somerset pulls in just 0.5% of the UK&apos;s international holiday market. John Turner, the association&apos;s director, is also deputy manager at Clarks Village. His ambition is for the Village to become the number one tourist attraction outside London \u2013 ahead of Alton Towers and Blackpool Tower \u2013 and he outlines his vision in enthusiastic, if rather corny, marketing-speak. &quot;We&apos;re seeing this as one of the big jewels in Somerset&apos;s crown, and we need to accentuate and develop that strategy. It&apos;s very consumer- centric. We need to start positioning Somerset as a brand. It&apos;s going to be a long hard slog.&quot; He goes on: &quot;We have Clarks as an international brand, we have Cheddar, the gorge and the cheese, and we have the likes of Joseph of Arimathea, who is supposed to have come to Glastonbury with the cup of Christ. We&apos;ve got King Arthur, who is said to be buried in Glastonbury Abbey. We&apos;ve got Glastonbury festival. These are all huge international names, but for some reason Somerset doesn&apos;t have the credibility it should have.&quot; Turner is well aware of the irony of the origin of his shopping centre&apos;s wares but believes UK retailers have a special credibility with Chinese visitors. &quot;There&apos;s so much counterfeit in the Chinese market that they don&apos;t trust their own shops,&quot; he says. The riddle of why the Village can sell Clarks to China may be primarily about price. Cheng, however, dismisses the counterfeit theory and says it is mostly &quot;silver aged&quot; visitors with an eye for a bargain. Shoes that cost nearly \u00a3100 in China sell in Clarks Village for less than \u00a340. (There are stories, perhaps apocryphal, of tourists buying 20 pairs at a time, reclaiming the cost of their air fare in savings.) &quot;We&apos;re talking about a really good discount,&quot; says Cheng. Clarks Village also offers a leaflet explaining how tourists can claim back 14% of VAT, with the help of experts in tax-free shopping. For Ronald Jim, 44, a shopper at Clarks Village who grew up in Bristol&apos;s Chinese community, the desire of Chinese tourists to buy Chinese-made European labels in Europe is more about status. &quot;It is very much like the Japanese. Those who have got money like to travel and buy things from the western world. A lot of those people wouldn&apos;t care whether it was made in China or not \u2013 they&apos;ve left the country, gone out, been on holiday and they&apos;ve bought something from afar. It&apos;s the label. It&apos;s the brand. It&apos;s a status symbol to buy things in Europe.&quot; How long can this British nation of shopkeepers trade on the status conferred by its history without actually making the things it sells? The replacement of factories with factory shopping in Street has certainly seen the status of jobs fall. Brian Chorley, 72, is the last surviving employee from the Clarks shoe factory who still works in the Village. He started there when he left school aged 14 in 1953. &quot;Everyone went to Clarks. If you went to a job interview you were guaranteed to come out with a job.&quot; He began by cleaning sandals on a conveyor belt for 49 shillings (\u00a32.45) a week. After paying his mother&apos;s keep, Chorley had a whole pound note in his pocket. &quot;I thought to myself, I&apos;m rich,&quot; he recalls. Promoted to a cutter, Chorley performed a highly skilled, well-paid job on a production line that made 37,000 pairs of shoes a week. &quot;The more you cut and the more leather you saved, the more money you earned,&quot; he says. It is easy to be nostalgic for the time when Britain made more things but Chorley recognises that, while Clarks was an excellent employer, his factory days were not paradise. The mechanical presses &quot;were absolutely lethal,&quot; he remembers. &quot;Of all the cutters only two or three people had all their fingers and thumbs.&quot; His job has now been downgraded to the unskilled one of picking up rubbish and recycling. But he still &quot;loves it&quot; at Clarks Village. &quot;I get a lot of pleasure and satisfaction picking up all the cardboard and polythene that used to be thrown away,&quot; he beams. Chorley brings up the closure of Clarks&apos;s British factories unprompted. &quot;As the years went by, they said they were going to put a factory in Portugal. We said, &apos;They can&apos;t make shoes in Portugal, that&apos;s never going to happen.&apos; The next thing we heard, a Clarks&apos; factory was shutting down. Bit by bit they all shut and now Clarks shoes are made all over the world, and they reckon they are making more money than ever because of the low wages.&quot; The last Clarks factory in Britain closed in 2005. Why did the company shut its British factories? &quot;We felt that the time was right, plus we had a growing confidence in the quality outside of the UK in terms of manufacturing,&quot; says a spokesperson. &quot;There was also a need to compete on a global scale with other manufacturers.&quot; Clarks Village employs 1,000 people, and Clarks head office still houses its design, marketing, branding, retail, finance and IT teams. In accordance with its Quaker roots, Clarks involves itself in good deeds, from raising $1m for the Soul of Africa, a charity for HIV orphans established by ex-managing director Lance Clark, to helping conserve the rare Large Blue butterfly in the hills close to Street. &quot;It may fly in the face of the industry norm but a key part of our character comes from where we are and is what makes us unique, and we&apos;re proud to celebrate this,&quot; says its spokesperson. Memories of the anger when Clarks closed its factories across the West Country still linger in Street. Chorley describes the town as &quot;very depressed&quot; when Clarks shut. &quot;There was always going to be a certain amount of anger,&quot; he says. Did local people welcome the factory shops replacing the factories? &quot;Most people are accepting of it, yes, but you don&apos;t have a lot of good jobs locally,&quot; says Deanne Silmon, secretary of the Street Society. &quot;Clarks Village is good for the town but the employment it produces is not particularly well paying. But it is certainly better than no industry at all.&quot; Chorley feels it is futile to agonise over what has been lost. He enjoys the work he has now and still treasures his memories. &quot;The noise and the activity cutting leather,&quot; he sighs. &quot;Now it&apos;s all Venetian blinds and computers, but the building is exactly the same. That&apos;s how things go.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/09/bob-dylan-london-feis-2011", "publicationDate": "2011-03-09T13:49:59Z", "tags": ["Bob Dylan", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "China", "World news", "London", "Festivals", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["But Chinese promoters are now quoted as saying: &quot;These Bob Dylan concerts are destined to be one of the year&apos;s major tours and a musical event of depth, grace and greatness.&quot; The Hollywood Reporter quoted Kelly Cha, a young Beijing-based musician, as saying: &quot;Dylan has probably got more fans than all the other acts that have visited China from overseas.&quot; Neither of Dylan&apos;s planned China shows is yet listed on the singer&apos;s official website but gigs are scheduled for Taipei, Taiwan, on 3 April and in Hong Kong, where he has played before, on 12 April.", "Jeffrey Wu, of Taiwan-based promoters Brokers Brothers Herald, said the 2010 shows were cancelled because authorities were wary of Dylan&apos;s past as countercultural icon."], "title": "Bob Dylan to play London Feis 2011", "article": "Bob Dylan has announced his only UK date for 2011.

It was a collective effort by a group of nationalists who complained that their government was giving in to western bullying. It carried an unpleasant political message, but it did raise the question of why \u2013 given that China had prospered for 30 years and its people were better off than they had been for 50 years \u2013 should unhappiness be an issue at all. Regardless of their motive, the authors of Unhappy China were on to something. Earlier this week, as China Digital Times reported, China&apos;s censors in the State Council Information Office issued an order: &quot;All websites are requested to immediately remove the story &apos;In China 94% Are Unhappy; Top-Heavy Concentration of Wealth&apos; and related information. Forums, blogs, microblogs, and other interactive spaces are not to discuss the matter.&quot; The figures came from a global Gallup Poll in which Denmark scored an impressive 82% of respondents who described themselves as happy. In China only 6% said they were, ranking the country 125th. China&apos;s least happy respondents lived in the first-tier cities, where people are relatively better off. Results like this are not very good news for a government whose legitimacy for the past 30 years has rested on rising living standards. Since Deng Xiaoping announced that &quot;to get rich is glorious&quot;, a minority \u2013 most of them in the Communist party \u2013 have grown very rich indeed. Millions more are better off. However, for the last decade, average household incomes have flatlined as a percentage of GDP and the wealth gap has yawned. Across China, people have rediscovered the well-rehearsed truth that material satisfaction is relative. The party is worried. For the last two Sundays some areas of Beijing and other cities have been swamped with police to forestall any possible imitation of demonstrations in the Middle East. In China there has been little public response but nothing seems to calm the jagged nerves of a government that now spends more on internal security than on external defence. As the National People&apos;s Congress meets in Beijing this week, happiness is much on its collective mind. Before the 3,000 delegates is China&apos;s 12th five-year plan, an economic blueprint that aims to spread the wealth a little more evenly. From this year, China will attempt to chart a course that will transform the economy from its current export-led, low-wage, low added-value model into a greener and more equitable mode of development. If it succeeds, it will be a shift in China&apos;s economic direction that will have global importance. The fear of popular discontent is only part of it. The real imperative is that China has exhausted all the elements that made the old economic model work: energy, resources, cheap labour, water and markets. It has the world&apos;s most rapidly ageing population, and the most developed parts of China are facing labour shortages that make wage levels uncompetitive. Industrial pollution of air and water have brought soaring cancer levels and irreversible land degradation, and the value added by churning out cheap goods for richer countries is not enough to pay for the damage. China has to change or implode. Like Japan, Taiwan and South Korea before it, China must now attempt to move up the value chain, inventing its own technologies, not assembling those of others. There will be huge investment in seven strategic emerging industries including electric cars, biotechnology, nuclear and renewable energy, and IT. Government investment in research and development is aimed at ensuring that the next generation of key technology patents are Chinese. More people will move from the countryside to cities, which will aim to be more habitable as China shifts its climate narrative from the defensive truculence of &quot;the west caused it; the west must fix it&quot; to a story of economic opportunity and promise. If the plan works, the west will have to look at its assumptions of technological dominance, and the country that has been emblematic of the world&apos;s environmental problems could become the key to solving them. Whether it will succeed in cheering up 94% of Chinese who are presently unhappy is another question."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/11/japan-earthquake-miyagi-tsunami-warning", "publicationDate": "2011-03-11T09:11:00Z", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Tsunamis"], "sentences": ["Tsunami watches have been issued for Guam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Hawaii and the entire western coast of the US and Canada, from the Mexican border to Chignik Bay in Alaska."], "title": "Powerful earthquakes hit Japan", "article": "     A series of massive earthquakes have struck north-east Japan, unleashing a 10-metre tsunami that swept buildings, vehicles, crops and debris across swaths of farmland.

At least five people are known to have died, but amid widespread reports of landslides, floods, collapsed buildings and fires, the death toll is expected to rise. The quake hit at 2.46pm (5.45am GMT), about 6 miles below sea level and 78 miles off the east coast. It was swiftly followed by five powerful aftershocks of up to 7.1 magnitude.

The quake and tsunami halted air and rail services across large parts of the country. Eight military planes were scrambled to survey the damage as areas along Japan&apos;s entire Pacific coast braced for aftershocks and the possibility of more tsunami.

Tsunami watches have been issued for Guam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Hawaii and the entire western coast of the US and Canada, from the Mexican border to Chignik Bay in Alaska. The Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan, promised a quick response as he called an emergency cabinet meeting. &quot;The earthquake has caused major damage in broad areas in northern Japan,&quot; Kan said during an emergency news conference. &quot;Some of the nuclear power plant in the region have automatically shut down, but there is no leakage of radioactive materials to the environment.&quot; The shutdown left 4m homes in and around Tokyo without power. Kan said he had set up an emergency taskforce to co-ordinate the rescue effort. &quot;The government will make an all-out effort to ensure the safety of all the people and contain the damage to the minimum,&quot; he said.

At least 10 people were injured when part of a hall roof collapsed in Tokyo, the metropolitan police department said. All flights were grounded immediately after the quake while officials checked for runway damage. Strong tremors were felt in Tokyo about 30 minutes after the quake. Newsreaders in the capital wore helmets as they gave updates, while office workers rushed out of buildings and on to the streets for safety. Osamu Akiya, 46, was working at his Tokyo office when the quake hit, sending bookshelves and other items flying and opening up cracks in the wall. &quot;I&apos;ve been through many earthquakes, but I&apos;ve never felt anything like this,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t know if we&apos;ll be able to get home tonight.&quot; Television footage showed a building on fire in the Odaiba district of Tokyo, although it was not immediately clear if the blaze was connected to the earthquake.

Authorities are evacuating tens of thousands of people from vulnerable areas. The largest waves are headed south-west from Japan at about 500mph and could cross the Pacific basin in 24 hours. There have been waves from four to seven metres high crashing into the Japanese coast. &quot;Our biggest concern is the Asia and Pacific region, where developing countries are far more vulnerable to this type of unfolding disaster. The tsunami is a major threat,&quot; said Paul Conneally of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. &quot;At the moment it is higher than some islands and could go right over them,&quot; he said. Several Pacific islands have already been hit by waves of around a metre but larger waves, up to 2m, could reach South America, said Kanoa Koyanagi, a geophysicist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre in Hawaii. The waves are expected to reach Ecuador at 23.31pm GMT, and Colombia and Peru in the early hours of Saturday morning. &quot;From what we&apos;re seeing in some of the Pacific islands most of the wave heights are up to around a metre, but some of those islands aren&apos;t in the main beam of the tsunami wave,&quot; Koyanagi said. &quot;There are certain directions the tsunami prefers to go in and those are where you&apos;re going to get the biggest waves. Certain parts of the South American coast probably will see almost nothing but other parts might get a metre or two of wave height.&quot; The timing between successive waves is around 20 minutes. The emergency will test the systems put into place to minimise casualties after the devastating Asian tsunami of 2004 in which more than 230,000 people are thought to have died. Japan warned of possible repeat tsunamis, urging its citizens to stay away from coastal areas. Television showed waves up to 10 metres high in some areas sweeping buildings and vehicles inland. Deep ocean gauges in the north Pacific had detected waves up to 2m above normal sea level, said Chip McCreary of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre. Sirens sounded in Hawaii where the tsunami is expected to arrive at around 12am GMT. Officials are evacuating all coastal areas. The island was shaken by a 4.5-magnitude tremor that the US Geological Survey said was probably unrelated to the quake off Japan. &quot;We&apos;re preparing for the worst and we&apos;re praying for the best,&quot; said John Cummings, spokesman for the Honolulu emergency management department. &quot;Tsunami waves, because of their long length, wrap around our islands very efficiently.&quot; In the Philippines officials ordered an evacuation of coastal communities along the east coast. Disaster management officials in Albay province, south-east of Manila, told residents to gather at designated sites at least five metres above sea level. Waves were expected to hit Guam, 1,500 miles (2,400km) south of Japan, at 11am GMT. Officials cleared beaches and hotels have moved guests to higher floors. Taiwan&apos;s coastguard began evacuating its east coast, although it is not heavily populated. The waves there are expected to be 50cm to 1m high. Russian officials have moved 11,000 residents from coastal areas of remote eastern Sakhalin island and nearby territories. &quot;A tsunami is a series of waves and the first wave may not be the largest,&quot; said a bulletin from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre. &quot;The threat can continue for many hours as multiple waves arrive.&quot; The waves will reach Guangdong and Fujian on the east coast of China at around 12.30pm GMT but experts do not expect significant damage."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/11/japan-earthquake-tsunami-pacific", "publicationDate": "2011-03-11T14:54:00Z", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "World news", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Asia Pacific", "Earthquakes", "Tsunamis"], "sentences": ["Tsunami watches have been issued for Guam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Hawaii and the entire western coast of the US and Canada, from the Mexican border to Chignik Bay in Alaska."], "title": "Japan earthquake: hundreds feared dead as tsunami spreads across Pacific", "article": "     Hundreds of people are feared dead after Japan&apos;s biggest earthquake since records began struck the country&apos;s north-east coast, unleashing a 10-metre tsunami that swept away buildings, ships and vehicles. The tsunami triggered warnings across the Pacific region. Police said they had found between 200 and 300 bodies in a coastal area of Sendai city, one of the worst-hit areas, the news agency Kyodo reported. There were reports of a major explosion at a petrochemical complex in Sendai. Japanese coastguards were searching for a ship carrying up to 100 people that was swept away by the tsunami and an entire passenger train was unaccounted for, according to the agency. The death toll is expected to rise, with landslides, collapsed buildings and at least 90 fires reported following the 8.9 magnitude shock. It rocked buildings 235 miles away in Tokyo, with experts saying it was about 1,000 times more powerful than the recent New Zealand quake. It has been followed by aftershocks with a strength of up to 7.1. About 3,000 people who live near the Fukushima nuclear plant are being evacuated after a state of emergency was declared at the powerhouse. Officials said this was a precautionary measure. The quake hit at 2.46pm Japan time (5.45am GMT), about 6 miles below sea level and 78 miles off the east coast. In Tokyo people screamed and grabbed each other&apos;s hands as it struck. The shock was so powerful it was felt as far away as Beijing.   View larger map   Television footage showed a four-metre wave sweeping over embankments in Sendai city, carrying cars and houses \u2013 some on fire \u2013 across farmland, before reversing course and carrying them out to sea. Public broadcaster NHK showed images of a large ship ramming into a breakwater in Kennuma city, Miyagi prefecture. The quake and tsunami halted air and rail services across large parts of the country. Eight military planes were scrambled to survey the damage as areas along Japan&apos;s entire Pacific coast braced for aftershocks and the possibility of more monster waves. The Pacific tsunami warning centre in Hawaii said Japan, Russia, Marcus Island and the Northern Marianas had been put on alert. Tsunami watches have been issued for Guam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Hawaii and the entire western coast of the US and Canada, from the Mexican border to Chignik Bay in Alaska. Warnings were lifted for Australia and New Zealand but the first waves of the tsunami hit Hawaii in the early hours of Friday and were expected to grow larger through the day. Water surged over the seawall in Waikiki but stopped short of the area&apos;s hotels. The Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan, promised a quick response as he called an emergency cabinet meeting. &quot;The government will make an all-out effort to ensure the safety of all the people and contain the damage to the minimum,&quot; he pledged in an emergency news conference, adding that he had set up a taskforce to co-ordinate the rescue effort. The shutdown left 4m homes in and around Tokyo without power. David Halton in Sendai said via Twitter: &quot;Broken buildings. People without electricity. It&apos;s freezing.&quot; Blaise Plant, also apparently tweeting from Sendai, said there were non-stop tremors with a big shock every 15 minutes or so. &quot;The buildings are all busted up ... massive billboards on the verge of falling ... We keep hearing sirens all over the place ... I hope everyone is ok. Stay safe Stay safe Stay safe.&quot; But he also told friends: &quot;Don&apos;t get me wrong ... we&apos;re not all jumping and screaming but just staying calm.&quot; Joseph Tame, a Briton living in Tokyo, said concrete buildings were shaking as if they were made of jelly and high-rises swaying back and forth. &quot;Everyone was in shock. Some people were crying and no one really knew what was happening ... But what struck me was how calm everyone stayed even while it was happening.&quot; Hiroshi Sato, a disaster management official in Iwate prefecture, said officials were having trouble getting an overall picture of the destruction. &quot;We don&apos;t even know the extent of damage. Roads were badly damaged and cut off as tsunami washed away debris, cars and many other things,&quot; he said. The US Geological Survey said it was the biggest earthquake to hit Japan since officials began keeping records in the late 1800s and one of the biggest recorded in the world. The quake is one of several to have struck north-east Japan this week, including one of magnitude 7.3 on Wednesday. In 1933 a magnitude 8.1 quake in the area killed more than 3,000 people. Last year fishing facilities were damaged by a tsunami caused by a strong quake in Chile. Japan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, accounting for about 20% of the world&apos;s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/11/tsunami-waves-reach-hawaii", "publicationDate": "2011-03-11T16:09:29Z", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Hawaii", "Japan", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news", "Taiwan", "Vanuatu", "Asia Pacific", "Earthquakes", "Tsunamis"], "sentences": ["Taiwan, one of the first countries to feel the force of the waves after Japan, recorded waves of barely 10cm."], "title": "Tsunami waves reach Hawaii following Japan earthquake", "article": "Emergency sirens woke residents around the beaches of Hawaii during the night to warn of the impending tsunami but the first waves to strike the islands were only a few feet high. Across the Pacific, low-lying islands and coastal areas were given hours of warning about the danger of a devastating wall of water moving at up to 500 miles an hour as it fanned out from the epicentre of the earthquake. Tourists in Waikiki were moved to higher floors in hotels and residents evacuated inland to community centres, but the surge was initially measured at only two or three feet above normal sea levels. Taiwan, one of the first countries to feel the force of the waves after Japan, recorded waves of barely 10cm. The tsunami&apos;s apparent dissipation as it spread out over the ocean encouraged more distant shores to relax their preparations. Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands were officially on a tsunami warning but were not expecting any of the devastation experienced in Japan, which was hit by waves of up to 10 metres. Lote Yates, from the Solomons Disaster Centre, told Australian Associated Press that it was only expecting some waves. &quot;As a precaution we&apos;ve activated our warning system to numerous remote costal villagers and outer islands,&quot; he said. An Australian government official in Papua New Guinea&apos;s capital, Port Moresby, said: &quot;If anything hits it will be the northern coast at around 9pm-10pm. But it&apos;s a big if.&quot; The Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC) at one stage extended its warning to cover most Pacific countries including Australia, Indonesia and even Chile. California was braced for two-metre waves. In Vanuatu islanders were told to leave low-lying areas. Suzanne Bule, 26, originally from Stourbridge in the West Midlands and now living in Vanuatu, told the Stourbridge News that she had helped evacuate guests to a hotel. &quot;My house is very near to the sea on the main island, however we think we should be high enough up and so we&apos;re staying put, monitoring the warnings ready to arrange for the guests to return once the threat has passed. &quot;We have a lot of earthquakes here and so are getting used to tsunami warnings. However they are always scary, especially when the earthquake epicentre is nearby as there is not always high ground easily accessible.&quot; Australian authorities insisted there was no risk. A spokesman for the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which operates the Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Centre, said the PTWC did not have the authority to issue warnings for Australia. &apos;&apos;There is no threat to the Australian mainland,&apos;&apos; he said. Russian authorities on the far-eastern Sakhalin Island and nearby territories evacuated around 11,000 residents from coastal areas."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/12/japan-earthquake-naoto-kan-tsunami", "publicationDate": "2011-03-12T09:30:00Z", "tags": ["Japan", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s premier, Liu Chao-shiuan, was forced out in 2009 after his government mishandled typhoon Morakot."], "title": "Japan needs leadership, but can Naoto Kan deliver? | Simon Tisdall", "article": "Naoto Kan, Japan&apos;s prime minister, already faced a mountain of problems before the earthquake and tsunami knocked his country for six. Only hours before disaster struck, Kan was insisting he would not resign over the latest party funding scandal. Such declarations have become a bit of a ritual in Japanese political life, and they often presage collapse: the country has had six prime ministers in five years. But right now Japan needs strong leadership like never before. Kan moved swiftly to take charge in the immediate aftermath of the quake, urging MPs to help him &quot;save the country&quot;, ordering troops into the worst-affected areas and shutting down high-risk nuclear plants and transport systems. He is surely aware of the fate awaiting leaders who fail to rise to the occasion when natural disasters hit. Taiwan&apos;s premier, Liu Chao-shiuan, was forced out in 2009 after his government mishandled typhoon Morakot. George Bush was almost blown away by hurricane Katrina in 2005. Perceptions of Kan&apos;s performance over the coming days will undoubtedly affect Japan&apos;s future political course. According to Eurasia Review, his approval rating stands at 20%, low even by Japanese standards. His ruling Democratic party (DPJ) has lost its way since its historic 2009 victory over the long-governing Liberal Democrats (LDP). Sixty-two per cent of voters think the government is doing a bad job, an Asahi Shimbun poll found this month. If Kan&apos;s quake leadership impresses a hitherto critical public, the prime minister could potentially turn things around, acquiring sufficient impetus to win next month&apos;s crucial budget battles and push through much-needed reforms of party funding. The LDP, whose sole interest in life up until now has been to bring down Kan and the DPJ, says it will co-operate with the government in the post-quake crisis and support additional spending measures as rebuilding begins. Money will certainly be needed \u2013 lots of it, judging by the pictures of damage wrought in the prefectures of north-eastern Tohoku region. But it will not be easy to find. &quot;Based on any stretch of the imagination, Japan is not in a good position to deal with a massive natural disaster,&quot; Hong Kong economist Robert Subbaraman told the Wall Street Journal. The country&apos;s debt burden was already the worst in the industrialised world, at nearly 200% of annual economic output, the Journal&apos;s William Sposato noted. &quot;The earthquake also hit an economy that has been struggling to recover from long-running deflationary pressures and a government that has little room to borrow the funds that may be needed for rebuilding,&quot; Sposato said. The 1995 Kobe earthquake that killed 6,400 people caused $100bn (\u00a362bn) of damage, the most expensive natural disaster in history. This quake was bigger. On the other hand, the affected areas this time were less populated. Tohoku accounts for only 8% of GDP. Japan&apos;s economy is better able to cope now than previously; the &quot;lost years&quot; of persistent stagnation have come to an end. But structural problems, such as an ageing population, the loss of lifetime corporate employment and an expensively subsidised agricultural base, continue to contribute to perceptions that the country&apos;s luck has run out after decades of record-breaking post-war expansion. Pessimism is driven by external factors, too. Arch-rival China has now officially overtaken Japan as the world&apos;s second largest economy, a title Tokyo held for more than 40 years. While Japan grew by 3.9% last year, China&apos;s growth rate was more than double that. China&apos;s military might is also increasing exponentially while Japan cuts defence spending and squabbles endlessly with Washington over the future of US bases. North Korea&apos;s alarming military stunts, which almost provoked a war with South Korea last year, are another unwelcome reminder of Japan&apos;s shaky geostrategic position. Maybe Beijing and Pyongyang will offer earthquake help: it would be a positive if unexpected gesture. Political weakness, economic under-performance, social dislocation and regional insecurity \u2013 phenomena familiar to Britain, another declining power \u2013 all feed the sense that modern Japan is a house built on wobbly foundations, metaphorically as well as literally. In consequence, the country may slowly be heading for its own, less dramatic version of an Arab-style uprising, suggested Michael Auslin of the American Enterprise Institute. &quot;Japanese sense they are nearing a turning point ... Corporate leaders in particular understand the danger of continued political paralysis, demographic decline and inward-looking youth. The need to do something to change current trends is perceived by nearly everyone I talked with, yet an instinctive Japanese conservatism keeps thing from going on the boil,&quot; Auslin said. Friday delivered a stunning physical shock. The country is still waiting to see whether the untested Kan and the DPJ can produce a political equivalent."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/13/nuclear-power-station-plans-criticised", "publicationDate": "2011-03-13T20:15:17Z", "tags": ["Nuclear power", "India", "China", "US news", "Indonesia", "Nuclear waste", "Greenpeace", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Friends of the Earth", "Chris Huhne", "UK news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The 2004 Sumatra tsunami which forced the temporary closure of the Kalpakkam nuclear power plant near Chennai and four plants in Taiwan also affected nuclear stations on the west coast of the US."], "title": "Nuclear power station plans criticised by pressure groups", "article": "Environmental pressure groups are calling on governments in the US, India, China, Turkey, and Indonesia to abandon new nuclear power stations and large waste dump projects or greatly raise safety standards after it emerged that many of the proposed developments are planned for areas vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis. According to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Authority, 20% of the world&apos;s 442 working commercial nuclear power stations are in areas of &quot;significant&quot; seismic activity. With the nuclear industry hoping to build 350 new reactors within 20 years to meet soaring electricity demand and to counter climate change, the risk of a nuclear catastrophe from a natural disaster is growing significantly, they say. &quot;Japanese plants were said to be earthquake resistant and the best prepared in the world for disaster, but see what happened. Seismic zones only make them more risky,&quot; said Karuna Raina, nuclear campaigner for Greenpeace India which is opposing plans for a massive nuclear plant being built in Maharashta state. According to the government&apos;s Geological survey of India, the Maharashta site and the surrounding area experienced 91 tremors between 1985 and 2005, ranging up to magnitude 6.3. Turkey meanwhile is planning three nuclear power plants at Akkuyu on the Aegean Sea. The site is only a few kilometres from the active Ecemis fault line and is in an area where large earthquakes have occurred in the past. A 1999 earthquake in Turkey killed nearly 20,000 people. In Chile, which has been hit by successive earthquakes in the last year, the government has declined to comment on plans to build several nuclear plants, despite significant opposition. Nuclear plants are generally built to withstand earthquakes of a maximum of 8.5 magnitude, but proofing installations against tsunamis is seldom considered. The 2004 Sumatra tsunami which forced the temporary closure of the Kalpakkam nuclear power plant near Chennai and four plants in Taiwan also affected nuclear stations on the west coast of the US. &quot;This is going to change the discussion in the US and elsewhere about basing energy supplies on nuclear power. Placing stations in earthquake zones is going to change the debate,&quot; said Tom Clements of Friends of the earth USA. Some governments have moved to calm nerves. India&apos;s top nuclear bodies said they would revisit all safety aspects of atomic plants in the country and analyse the nuclear crisis arising in Japan after the tsunami as it has offered new lessons to fine tune existing emergency preparedness. &quot;We will not jump to say that our power reactors will not suffer a similar kind of situation but we are planning to revisit all the safety aspects of our plants after doing a complete analysis of the Japanese incident and share the entire safety means with the public in a transparent way,&quot; said SK Jain, the chairman and managing director of Nuclear Power Corporation of India. Energy and climate change secretary Chris Huhne said: &quot;We take this incident extremely seriously even though there is no reason to expect a similar scale of seismic activity in the UK. I have called on the chief nuclear inspector, Dr Mike Weightman for a thorough report on the implications of the situation in Japan and the lessons to be learned. It is essential that we understand the full facts and their implications, both for existing nuclear reactors and any new programme, as safety is always our number one concern.&quot; Nancy Birch, of the anti-nuclear group Kick Nuclear said: &quot;Only last December, Cumbria was hit by an earthquake. It hit an area that has been earmarked by the government to store decades-worth of cancer-causing, high-level radioactive waste. The disaster in Japan clearly demonstrates that nuclear energy is too dangerous to be considered a sustainable form of energy in the 21st century. We want a future, not a disaster.&quot; In Germany around 50,000 protesters came out in force at the weekend to urge the government to drop plans to extend the life of its atomic reactors after news of the Japanese disaster. The Japanese disaster has also shaken confidence in the Philippines to revive its mothballed Bataan nuclear plant, a senior government official said on Sunday. Presidential spokeswoman Abigail Valte told a government radio station that it was not timely to discuss nuclear energy as source of power for the country. &quot;Alternative fuels [renewables] are less controversial ... you meet less opposition and it might be the win-win solution for everyone,&quot; she said. Taner Yildiz, the Turkish energy minister, dismissed critics. &quot;The [Japanese] system shut down automatically right after the earthquake and it opened when everything turned out normal. I can say Japan has tested itself. Nuclear power plant projects will continue in Turkey.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s premature to make any long term statements,. The situation has to be assessed and then action taken,&quot; said Giovanni Verlini, a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Authority. in Vienna. \u2022 This article was amended on 14th March 2011.

The unprecedented intervention failed to prevent the country&apos;s main stock market index plunging by more than 6% on Monday, followed by a further 6% slump early this morning when markets opened, but is thought to have averted a steeper fall. Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei index dragged down shares across the world as investors worried that a decline in the world&apos;s third biggest economy would reduce the value of goods and services the country bought from overseas. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares slumped by nearly 1% and its Europe-wide equivalent fell by 1.06%. In the US, the S&amp;P 500 was down 1.15% in afternoon trading, while Germany&apos;s Dax and France&apos;s CAC 40 indices ended the day down 1.65% and 1.3% respectively. Analysts said European shares would probably have fallen further, if Brussels had not agreed at the weekend to increase the eurozone&apos;s bailout fund from around \u00a4250bn (\u00a3216bn) to \u00a4440bn, making a repeat of the Irish and Greek crises less likely. As Japanese workers battled to prevent a nuclear meltdown and the unrest continued in the Middle East, the price of oil and gas increased amid concerns that Japan, a country heavily dependent on nuclear energy, may need to significantly step up its consumption of fossil fuels. Japan typically gets about a third of its energy from nuclear power. It has seen its capacity reduced by more than a fifth by the country&apos;s worst earthquake, which has left 11 reactors out of action. Michala Marcussen, head of global economics at the French bank Societe Generale, said: &quot;Power supply is a critical factor. If power production output is damaged in a sustainable fashion, that could have a durable impact on the economy.&quot; The price of gas jumped by as much as 7.4% to the highest level since November 2008, while a barrel of Brent crude oil tumbled by $0.56, or 0.5%, to $113.28 at one stage before rising again slightly later. Gold jumped by as much as 1% to $1,431.89 (\u00a3885.34) an ounce and silver rose by more than 2% as rattled investors fled from any asset that looked risky into the relative safety of precious metals. The Japanese economy is expected to take a huge hit over the next few months as companies there, including foreign businesses such as GlaxoSmithKline, the British drug firm, temporarily cease production, with frequent disruptions expected to continue for weeks. Toyota, the world&apos;s largest carmaker, said that it would produce up to 40,000 fewer vehicles, as it closes 12 plants across the country until at least Wednesday night. The company will lose $72m for each day its operations are shut down in Japan. AIR Worldwide, the risk modelling agency, calculates that the global insurance bill for the earthquake will be $35bn (\u00a322bn), while the total economic losses \u2013 insurance costs plus lost productivity \u2013 would add up to more than \u00a362bn, according to the Equecat risk consultancy. Meanwhile, UK, European, US and Asian economies will also suffer, but to a far lesser degree, as exports to Japan fall. Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHSGlobal Insight in New York, estimates the disaster could knock as much as 5% off Japan&apos;s gross domestic product (GDP) in the second quarter of the year \u2013 April to June \u2013 and between 0.3% and 0.5% over 2011 as a whole. The UK and the US are likely to see around 0.1% knocked off their GDP as a result of the disaster this year, with the Asian economies being hit &quot;about two or three times as hard as that&quot;, Behravesh said. &quot;With these kind of disasters, the economy typically takes a big hit to start with but later benefits from huge levels of reconstruction activity. I would expect a significant slowdown in Japan in the second quarter but then there could be a significant rebound as soon as the third quarter.&quot; &quot;Purely in terms of economic growth, the damage as a result of the disasters and the reconstruction activity roughly cancel each other out,&quot; he added. &quot;It is a rich country with a lot of savings and can handle this.&quot; In Asia, the effect of the earthquake on the leading stock exchanges was mixed. Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng index rose by 0.4% and China&apos;s Shanghai Composite edged up by 0.1%, with coal companies benefitting in particular on the hope that nuclear power problems in Japan would force the country to burn more fossil fuel at the same time as the expected frequent power cuts would allow Asian rivals to steal away some of its business. However, shares in Taiwan&apos;s TAIEX index fell by 0.56% to a three month low, on concern that the Japanese crisis would reduce tourists from the country as well as demand for exports. The earthquake also had a mixed impact on commodity prices. While some commodities increased, others, such as corn, cocoa, sugar, cotton and copper decreased, on concern that the decline of the Japanese economy would reduce demand for them. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 March 2011.

Austria said it was moving its embassy out of Tokyo to the western city of Osaka. Setbacks in the struggle to avert disaster at an atomic power plant in the north-east of the country also sparked a fresh round of panic-buying in the Japanese capital, where tiny amounts of radioactivity registered for the first time since last Friday&apos;s earthquake and subsequent tsunami. People in Tokyo endured another day of anxiety as they heard that the plant had been rocked by two more explosions and evidence emerged that water in a pool storing spent fuel rods may be boiling. Tokyo is already experiencing serious disruption to its transport network after Tepco, the city&apos;s electricity supplier, decided to implement rolling power cuts triggered by disruption to power generation by the disaster. &quot;I&apos;m not that worried about another earthquake \u2013 it&apos;s the radiation that scares me,&quot; said Masashi Yoshida, who was waiting for a flight out of Haneda airport with his five-year-old daughter. Those among Tokyo&apos;s 12 million people who decided to stay snapped up batteries, torches, candles and sleeping bags, and stripped shelves of bread, bottled water, instant noodles and canned food. The hoarding, partly prompted by the prospect of regular power cuts over the next six weeks, threatens to hamper efforts to divert supplies to the quake zone, where millions are suffering food and water shortages. Scientists said radiation levels near the Fukushima No 1 nuclear plant, where more than 200,000 people have been evacuated or told to stay inside, posed no immediate threat to the capital, which is 150 miles to the south. Naoto Kan, the prime minister, urged 140,000 people living within 19 miles of the plant to remain indoors. About 70,000 people living within 12 miles have already been evacuated. &quot;I know that people are very worried, but I would like to ask you to stay calm,&quot; Kan said. &quot;Radioactive material will reach Tokyo but it is not harmful to humans, because it will be dissipated by the time it gets there,&quot; said Koji Yamazaki, a professor of environmental science at Hokkaido University on Japan&apos;s main north island. Prolonged fears of a serious accident could weaken Tokyo&apos;s role as an international financial hub. Several firms said they were pulling staff out, including 350 Indian employees of the software services exporter Infosys Systems. But big financial firms in Japan were going about their &quot;business as usual&quot;, said the International Bankers Association, which represents firms such as Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. The French embassy advised its citizens to leave and the German embassy advised people with families to do the same. China is poised to evacuate its nationals from badly affected areas of north-east Japan. Several international airlines said they would avoid Tokyo until they were certain the danger had passed. Lufthansa became the first European airline to announce its daily flights to Tokyo would switch to Osaka and Nagoya at least until the weekend, and Air China cancelled flights from Beijing and Shanghai. Taiwan&apos;s EVA Airways said it would not fly to Tokyo and Sapporo for the rest of the month. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic said services to Narita and Haneda, Tokyo&apos;s main airports, were not affected. Causes of concern The Fukushima engineers&apos; main priorities now are to cool the three overheating reactors by pumping seawater into them and to ensure that water levels in the storage pools do not fall low enough to expose the spent fuel rods. In the best-case scenario, the storage pools do not overheat and engineers manage to pump cold seawater into the damaged reactors over the coming days and gradually bring them down to a safe temperature, when they can be put into cold storage. In a more worrying scenario, cooling at any or all of the reactors fails to prevent the nuclear cores from going into a meltdown. At very high temperatures, the core could melt through the containment system and cause an explosion inside the building. If that explosion damaged the outer containment structure, which is made of steel-lined reinforced concrete, radiation from the reactor could escape into the environment. In this scenario, one option would be to seal the whole reactor with lead and concrete. Another scenario causing concern involves the storage pools, because they do not have containment systems to stop radiation leaking from them. Because the cooling systems have failed, the storage pools have started to heat up. If they boil dry, the fuel rods will be exposed and could potentially release vast amounts of radiation directly into the environment.

The news came amid reports that radiation from the stricken plant had found its way into the food supply, raising anxiety in a country already struggling to deal with the aftermath of the worst crisis in its postwar history. Meanwhile Switzerland has announced it will move its embassy in Japan to Osaka because of fears radiation levels in Tokyo could increase. The operator of the Fukushima plant, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said it would have to vent radioactive gas from reactor 3, but later called off the risky procedure after pressure inside stabilised, albeit at a relatively high level. The Kyodo news agency reported that Tepco said six staff members had been exposed to more than 100 milliSieverts of radiation, but had been assigned to other tasks and were continuing to work because they had not shown any abnormal signs since being exposed. The government earlier increased to 250 mSv the limit for those working in the emergency operation. Japan&apos;s fire and disaster management agency said readings of up to 27 mSv were detected on 50 firefighters. They were decontaminated after a 13-hour operation to spray water into the spent fuel pool at reactor 3 ended in the early hours of the morning. On Sunday morning, workers doused a pool at reactor 4, also a cause of concern, for the first time. &quot;I think the situation is improving step by step,&quot; the deputy chief cabinet secretary, Tetsuro Fukuyama, told a news conference. Yukiya Amano, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), heralded a &quot;strengthening&quot; of work. But Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy-general at Japan&apos;s Nuclear Safety Agency, cautioned: &quot;We are making progress ... [but] we shouldn&apos;t be too optimistic.&quot; Technicians have already restored power lines to reactors 1 and 2. They hope they can restore cooling systems, although the pumps may well have been damaged by the earthquake, tsunami and subsequent explosions at the plant. David Lochbaum of the Union of Concerned Scientists in the US told Reuters: &quot;The workers need to go through the plant, figure out what survived and what didn&apos;t, what can be readily repaired and get the cooling systems back up and running to deal with the cores and the spent fuel pools.&quot; Tepco&apos;s president has made a public apology for &quot;causing such great concern and nuisance&quot;. The firm has been widely criticised for not being open enough about the problems at the facility and its attempts to remedy them. The government&apos;s chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, confirmed the plant would not be used again. The nuclear safety agency said the facility could be buried in sand and concrete, as happened at Chernobyl following the nuclear disaster in 1986, but has said that trying to cool the reactors remains the priority for now. Japan is considering a temporary ban on sales of food products from the Fukushima region after levels of radiation exceeding government limits were found in milk and spinach. The contaminated food and water pose no threat to human health, Edano said, adding that the tainted milk and spinach had not found its way on to the market. &quot;These levels do not pose an immediate threat to your health. Please stay calm.&quot; Iodine-131 was present in milk at a farm 20 miles away from the crippled nuclear plant and in spinach grown at farms more than 60 miles away in neighbouring Ibaraki. Tiny amounts of radioactive iodine have been found in tap water in and around Tokyo, about 150 miles away from the atomic plant, and five prefectures near Fukushima. The education and science ministry said traces of another radioactive material, caesium-137, had been identified in tap water in nearby Tochigi and Gunma prefectures, but posed no danger to people even if ingested. The government is to provide daily counts of radioactive materials in tap water from all of the affected areas, as well as levels in atmospheric fallout such as rain and dust. Radiation was also detected on fava beans exported to Taiwan. An official from Taiwan&apos;s department of health said a shipment of beans from Japan&apos;s south-western Kyushu island had shown slightly higher radiation than naturally occurring trace levels. The department said the radiation, detected only on the surface of the beans, was well below Taiwan&apos;s legal limit and not harmful to human health. Radioactive dust and particles were recorded in the greater Tokyo area but posed no risk to health, the government said on Sunday. Edano said someone who drank the tainted milk for a year would receive the same amount of radiation as in a single CT health scan; eating the spinach would be the equivalent of one-fifth. He said the contaminated water, milk and spinach would have to be consumed in enormous quantities over a long period to pose a threat to health. &quot;If you eat it once, or twice or even for several days, it&apos;s not just that it&apos;s not an immediate threat to health, it&apos;s that even in the future it is not a risk,&quot; he said. &quot;Experts say there is no threat to human health.&quot; Graham Andrew, a senior IAEA official, told reporters in Geneva that Japan was considering halting food sales from the affected region. The spread of radioactivity to the food supply is already affecting Japanese food exports. South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan and Singapore have started screening food arriving from the country. Local farmers said they were worried that the discoveries would affect other, so far unaffected, produce from the region, which is known for its rice and several varieties of fruit and vegetable. &quot;There will be damaging rumours,&quot; said Shizuko Kohata, a farmer who was evacuated from her home near the Fukushima plant. &quot;I grow things for a living, and I&apos;m worried that I won&apos;t be able to carry on after this.&quot; The government said radioactive iodine-131 present in spinach tested on Wednesday was three to seven times above acceptable government standards. Levels in drinking water from Fukushima were slightly over the limit on Thursday but had decreased significantly by the weekend, the health ministry said. Drinking one litre (1.76 pints) of water with the iodine at Thursday&apos;s levels is the equivalent of receiving one 88th of the radiation from a chest x-ray, said Kazuma Yokota, a spokesman for the prefecture&apos;s disaster response headquarters. Iodine-131 decays within a matter of weeks, but can pose a short-term risk to health, the IAEA said. &quot;There is a short-term risk to human health if radioactive iodine food is absorbed into the human body,&quot; the agency said. &quot;If ingested, it can accumulate in and cause damage to the thyroid. Children and young people are particularly at risk.&quot; A potentially greater concern is caesium-137, which caused widespread damage to the food supply in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster. The substance affects cells in the entire body and can increase the chances of developing cancer."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/22/japan-food-contamination-nuclear-plant", "publicationDate": "2011-03-22T10:25:00Z", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Nuclear power", "World news", "Environment", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["China, Taiwan and South Korea said they would tighten screening of Japanese imports."], "title": "Japan fears food contamination as battle to cool nuclear plant continues", "article": "The operation to cool the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has suffered a setback after smoke and vapour was seen rising from two reactors, as anxiety grew over the safety of food produced in the area. Water in a pool for storing spent fuel was reaching boiling point, raising the possibility that spent fuel rods could be exposed in turn releasing further radiation, said an official from the nuclear safety agency. &quot;We cannot leave this alone and we must take care of it as quickly as possible,&quot; said the official, Hidehiko Nishiyama. Days after Japanese authorities reported abnormal levels of radiation in milk, some vegetables and tap water, the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said high levels of radioactivity had been found in seawater near the facility, raising fears that seafood has also been contaminated. The power company said seawater samples contained levels of radioactive iodine 126.7 times the allowed limit, and caesium 24.8 times over. The firm said the quantities posed no immediate threat to health. &quot;You would have to drink [the seawater] for a whole year just in order to accumulate one millisievert [of radiation],&quot; a Tepco official said. Background radiation from substances in the air and soil generally emit between one and 10 mSv a year. The source of the contamination has yet to be established, but officials believe it probably came from the tonnes of seawater that have been sprayed over overheating reactors and fuel rod pools in recent days. The Fukushima prefectural government said no marine products from the region had been distributed after the earthquake. Any evidence that contamination has spread to seafood would add further misery to the region&apos;s food producers. About 6,000 residents of a village near the plant have been told not to drink tap water, while a ban has been imposed on shipments of milk, spinach, and kakina \u2013 a leafy vegetable \u2013 produced in the area. The government said it had no plans to extend a 20km (12-mile) evacuation zone around the nuclear plant, despite elevated radiation readings outside the area. &quot;At the moment, there is no need to expand the evacuation area,&quot; the government&apos;s chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, told a briefing. The government&apos;s latest readings, taken 10km outside the evacuation zone, show radiation levels of 110 microsieverts per hour, higher than normal background levels but well below those deemed a risk to health. The Kyodo news agency quoted International Atomic Energy Agency data showing that radiation levels 1,600 times higher than normal had been detected in a now-evacuated residential area near the crippled atomic plant. According to agency inspectors, radiation levels of 161 microsieverts per hour were detected in the town of Namie, about 20km away. Amid growing concerns over food safety, Japanese authorities are reportedly considering a wider ban on the shipment of certain foodstuffs from the affected region. &quot;They&apos;re going to have to take some decisions quickly in Japan to shut down and stop food being used completely from zones which they feel might be affected,&quot; Gregory Hartl, a World Health Organisation spokesman, told Associated Press in Geneva. The WHO said the long-term effects on health from contaminated food was of greater concern that the spread of radioactive particles in the air. &quot;A week ago we were more concerned about purely the radiation leakages and possible explosion of the nuclear facility itself, but now other issues are getting more attention, including the food safety issue,&quot; Hartl said. &quot;Repeated consumption of certain products is going to intensify risks, as opposed to radiation in the air that happens once, and then the first time it rains there&apos;s no longer radiation in the air.&quot; The WHO said the spread of radiation into the food supply was more serious than it had first thought, although it added that no tainted products had reached overseas markets. Japan is an exporter of seafood, fruit and vegetables, and dairy products, with Hong Kong, China and the US its biggest markets. China, Taiwan and South Korea said they would tighten screening of Japanese imports. Workers at the Fukushima plant have attached power cables to all six reactors and started pumping water into one of them in an attempt to prevent overheating fuel rods from reaching the potentially catastrophic meltdown phase. &quot;There are signs of light that we are getting out of this crisis,&quot; the prime minister, Naoto Kan, was quoted as saying. But that optimism was tempered by the sight of what appeared to be steam rising from the No 2 reactor and smoky haze above the No 3 reactor. The latter has given particular cause for concern because it contains plutonium-uranium mixed oxide fuel \u2013 or MOX \u2013 and would release highly toxic plutonium in the event of a meltdown. Tepco officials said the emissions had temporarily halted work to cool off the reactors. The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami continued to rise on Tuesday, as more bodies were retrieved from the vast stretch of coastline hit by the tsunami. Police said 8,928 people had been confirmed dead and a further 12,664 were missing. Various estimates have put the current death toll at nearer 18,000."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/edinburgh/2011/mar/23/edinburgh-international-festival-2011-programme-launch", "publicationDate": "2011-03-23T12:25:08Z", "tags": [], "sentences": ["Its theme is To The Far West and will bring performers from China, India, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam to the Scottish capital."], "title": "Dance dominates 2011 Edinburgh International Festival", "article": "The programme for this summer&apos;s EIF was unveiled at The Hub on the Royal Mile this morning.

Dollar signs are lighting up in the eyes of movie producers across the globe. China is not alone in imposing limits on non-domestic films, but its quota regime is among the world&apos;s tightest. Hollywood was unlikely to tolerate that, especially with the Chinese market growing at an astonishing pace. In 2005, China&apos;s box-office receipts totalled \u00a3150m; last year they were just under \u00a31bn. Sure enough, the US lodged a complaint with the WTO in 2007. The deadline for the lifting of the quota has now passed, but China&apos;s State Film Bureau has yet to announce what changes it will make, and local film-makers are already worrying about the increased competition from overseas. The 20 foreign titles that have previously been allowed in each year would compete with more than 500 domestic movies. Even so, they have accounted for around 45% of Chinese box-office revenues. Last year, Avatar alone grossed \u00a3125m, totally dwarfing the \u00a365m made by China&apos;s highest-grossing domestic film ever, Let the Bullets Fly. Albert Lee, CEO of Emperor Motion Pictures, which co-produced Let the Bullets Fly, says: &quot;Imagine if you had 30 Avatars a year. They&apos;d completely take over the market. The quota system helps local producers better survive against the inevitable Hollywood invasion.&quot; But Teng Jimeng, professor of film at the Beijing Language and Culture University, believes the quota is unlikely to be entirely removed this year. &quot;Any changes they introduce will be incremental,&quot; he says. Most observers expect China to simply raise the import cap to 30 films this year, then a little more each year subsequently. But the import quota is not just intended to protect Chinese films economically \u2013 it also has cultural ramifications, preserving a national film identity. Zhao Huili, the producer behind the 2007 low-budget hit Invisible Wings, says: &quot;It&apos;s about safeguarding local stories, not just local production companies.&quot; Many in China look to the contrasting examples of Taiwan and South Korea. In 2001, Taiwan dropped its film-import restrictions as it joined the WTO. Today foreign movies take 97% of box office revenues. South Korea, by contrast, kept a quota \u2013 73 days a year are reserved for the screening of Korean-only films \u2013 and has fostered a flourishing domestic industry; now Korean films regularly outsell Hollywood on home soil. For Teng, the Korean comparison is apt because of the way Korea uses the cinemas themselves as the last line of defence. &quot;The Chinese government might have to allow 100 foreign films a year, but it can still create barriers by placing films in bad time slots \u2013 for example, at 9am. Even if movie theatres want to make money out of foreign hits, there&apos;s still the possibility of a political directive coming down from the film bureau.&quot; Certainly, this was the case last year, when Avatar was pulled to make way for the state-backed biopic Confucius, starring Chow Yun-Fat. But, as the disappointing box-office run of Confucius shows, the power to decide the future of Chinese film ultimately lies with Chinese consumers. And they are increasingly being courted by Hollywood. This year, for example, Jay Chou \u2013 a Taiwanese pop\u00a0star adored across China \u2013 was chosen to star alongside Seth Rogen in The Green Hornet, instead of\u00a0someone like Jet Li, who is far more recognisable in the west, but less marketable back\u00a0home. While some are thrilled to see homegrown celebrities in demand abroad, others are less enthused. &quot;They might be using Chinese faces and locations in China, but it&apos;s still\u00a0a case of Hollywood expertise and Hollywood storylines,&quot; says Teng.\u00a0&quot;Chinese talents and resources are being\u00a0drained. It&apos;s as if the Chinese film industry is being colonised.&quot; \u2022\u00a0This article was amended on 28 March, 2011, when a reference to Teng Jimeng discussing the quota with the State Film Bureau was removed."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/28/house-prices-global-economy", "publicationDate": "2011-03-27T23:05:00Z", "tags": ["Global economy", "Economics", "Business", "Europe", "World news", "House prices", "Property", "Money"], "sentences": ["House price growth by region in 2010 Asia-Pacific: 7.5% Middle East: 5.3% South America: 3.8% Europe: 1.4% North America: 0% Price growth by country :Hong Kong: +20.1% Latvia: +16.9% Israel: +16.2% China: +15.3% Singapore: +14.0% Austria: 9.9% France: 9.5% India: 8.9% Poland: 8.1% Denmark: 7.8% Taiwan: 7.4% Sweden: 5.2% Germany: 3.0% Turkey: 2.6% South Africa: 0.9% Russia: 0.9% Iceland: -1.4% Italy: -1.4% Spain: -3.5% Portugal: -4.0% Greece: -6.0% Dubai: -6.1% Ireland: -10.8% Source: Knight Frank Global House Price Index"], "title": "Property values in Asia soar while price rises in Europe lag behind", "article": "  The global housing sector is operating a two-speed market as prices of western properties stagnate while the value of homes in emerging economies continues to power ahead.

The global housing market benefited as strong price growth in the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East offset stagnation in Europe and the US. Hong Kong saw the biggest increases, with house prices jumping more than 20% last year, while Ireland record the biggest decline, of nearly 11%, according to Knight Frank.

It sought an order barring imports of the iPhone. &quot;The two mobile-phone makers have been embroiled in litigation since October 2009, when Nokia filed a lawsuit accusing Apple of infringing 10 patents and demanding royalties on the millions of iPhones sold since the device&apos;s introduction in 2007.

In this city so closely connected with the sea, the Japanese director explained why he chose to end the film with a tsunami, and why the Japanese celebrate nature in spite of its destructive power. &quot;There are many typhoons and earthquakes in Japan,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no point in portraying these natural disasters as evil events. They are one of the givens in the world in which we live. I am always moved when I visit Venice to see that in this city which is sinking into the sea, people carry on living regardless. It is one of the givens of their life. In the same way people in Japan have a different perception of natural disasters.&quot; True enough, in Miyazaki&apos;s animated films nature dictates its terms on mankind. Ultimately the tsunami in Ponyo is beneficial for the country it wrecks, which with its ageing population and small coastal towns closely resembles the real Japan. But not all the pictures in Japanese films, whether animated or not, are underpinned by such environmentally aware animistic harmony. In most feature films the sea round Japan is a deadly enemy, stirred by subterranean forces. Alain Schlockoff, who organised the Paris Fantastic Film festival for many years and now edits L&apos;Ecran Fantastique, a specialist magazine, was particularly impressed by Tidal Wave, a 1974 science fiction movie that caused a sensation in Japan. Based on Nihon Chinbotsu, a disaster novel by Sakyo Komatsu, the story hinged on the disappearance of the archipelago due to tsunamis and volcanic eruptions caused by shifting tectonic plates. &quot;Japanese film technicians are very good at building scale models and the pictures in the film were exactly like what we have just seen,&quot; says Schlockoff. It was remade in 2006, as The Submersion of Japan, testimony to the enduring appeal of such nightmares. Since 1945 and the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the awareness of the threat from the natural environment has been compounded by fear of nuclear war. The manga Barefoot Gen in Hiroshima was made into a film, but most cartoons depict the cities&apos; destruction without explaining the cause. A typical example is the 2001 anime Metropolis, loosely based on Fritz Lang&apos;s eponymous work. Similarly Steamboy, by Katsuhiro Otomo, is set in a parallel world where neither the internal combustion engine nor nuclear power have been invented. Technology does, however, represent a deadly hazard for the community. The approach to these disasters is not so much premonitory. It is more a way of exorcising fears. Godzilla is the oldest instance, and the most famous. The monster was born in 1954, less than 10 years after the atom bombs, at the Toho studios, where a statue still stands. The giant lizard came into existence following experiments by American nuclear scientists. It was sufficiently powerful, tough and radioactive to destroy the whole of Tokyo and unlike King Kong prompted no sympathy at all, just terror. The film was such a success that about 30 follow-ups were made. In 1998, Hollywood commissioned Roland Emmerich to shoot a remake. In this version the mutation was caused by French nuclear tests in the Pacific. Yet another remake is on the way. Japan&apos;s nightmares are contagious. On 8 March, the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro announced that he was starting work on Pacific Rim, in which a fault in the ocean floor releases swarms of monstrous creatures that destroy Tokyo and Los Angeles. But some doubt the project will ever happen, given the fearful reality of the disaster that has now struck Japan. Watching the pictures on television Schlockoff admits to feeling &quot;somehow ashamed at having enjoyed these films&quot;. They were, after all, a chilling premonition, not an exorcism. Driven by destruction Apocalyptic events, regardless of the form they take, are a central theme in mangas such as Ken the Survivor, Akira or Neon Genesis Evangelion. The threat of an earthquake or tsunami appears in many series, serving as a driving force in the narrative, a backdrop to romance or a remote starting point justifying the existence of a post-disaster world. The theme is also tied up with the various forms mangas may take, depending on their readership, with seinen, for adult readers, addressing &quot;serious&quot; topics, shojo for young women, shonen for their male counterparts and a host of other sub-genres. In Tokyo Mew Mew, a lightweight story for girls, the main character acquires magical powers and a feline appearance after an earthquake. At the other extreme Tokyo Magnitude 8 offers a realistic account of the consequences of a massive quake that devastates the archipelago. A fairly conventional rite of passage, the story centres on two survivors in the ruins of a man-made island wrecked by the tremor, but also describes rescue operations in considerable detail. Spirit of the Sun, by Kaiji Kawaguchi, is an outstanding manga, which starts with a gigantic quake, so severe it breaks Honshu, the largest island of Japan, in two. A tsunami follows, devastating what remains of the country. Under the pretence of providing humanitarian aid, the Chinese army takes over what soon becomes North Japan, whereas the US army occupies the south. Though at first sight a fairly typical example of the post-disaster genre, Spirit of the Sun offers a critical view of Japan in the 2000s, using its description of the living conditions of Japanese refugees in Taiwan to make barely veiled allusions to the strict immigration policies enforced by the government in Tokyo. Although earthquakes and tsunamis are recurrent motifs in many books and films, they are far from neutral. Publication of X, a fantasy inspired by the Bible, in particular the Apocalypse, was suspended for several months in 1995. Its recurrent tremors, purportedly announcing the imminent end of the world, upset many readers at a time when Kobe had just been hit by an earthquake that claimed nearly 6,500 lives. Several similar series are likely to be suspended in the near future. On television the rerun of an anime version of Tokyo Magnitude 8 has already been shelved, and other animes containing tsunami sequences have met a similar fate or are being rewritten.

Italy says it is trying to organise an African safe haven, and the Libyan leader may be seeking a way out for himself and his family. But international action to hold Gaddafi and his commanders to account over the violent suppression of the uprising in its early weeks has left little room for manoeuvre. It may have been hoped that they could flee to one of several dozen countries that, like Libya, have not ratified the Rome statute, the treaty that established the ICC. Those include Sudan, Morroco, Algeria, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Iran, Saudi Arabia, India as well as three permanent members of the UN security council: the US, China and Russia. But the powers of the ICC investigation extend to all of those countries because the security council, in resolution 1970, urges all member states to co-operate fully, whether they recognise the Hague-based court or not. If the ICC prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, applies for arrest warrants for Libyan commanders, which could be in May, the UN would expect all its members to make arrests. In theory, the only way Gaddafi can be sure of shelter is if he finds a country that is not a member of the UN, such as the Vatican, Kosovo or Taiwan. But none of these are likely safe havens. In practice, however, some member states are not cooperating fully with ICC investigations ordered by the security council. Sudan failed to act on the 2009 international warrant for its head of state, Omar al-Bashir, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur, leading the ICC to describe him as &quot;a fugitive president&quot;. In 2005, the court issued warrants for Joseph Kony, leader of the Lord&apos;s Resistance Army, based in northern Uganda, and four of his commanders for murder, enslavement, sexual enslavement, rape and forcibly enlisting children into the guerrilla group. The ICC says Kony has since been active in Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic \u2013 all UN member states \u2013 but has not been arrested. Observers of the ICC say a growing antagonism among some African states towards its prosecutions could lead to Gaddafi being offered a safe haven in one of them. There have beenSeveral African Union resolutions in the past 12 months have asked the security council to suspend ICC investigations because of concern that African countries are being unduly targeted. &quot;It is possible for [Gaddafi] to end up in an African state that is simply not willing to co-operate and that will create difficulties,&quot; says Malcolm Shaw QC, a senior fellow at Cambridge University&apos;s Lauterpacht centre for international law. He says an alternative would be for Britain, US and France to assure a country, privately, that the international community would not pressure it to arrest the Libyan leaders, in return for providing them with an exit from Libya now. That could never be stated publicly, and amnesties in Chile and Argentina show that while they may work in the short term, pressure grows over time for the alleged criminals to be brought to justice. &quot;I have heard people say that resolution 1970 was a mistake because it gives Gaddafi no way out,&quot; says Shaw. &quot;It basically said to Gaddafi, &apos;You have to fight to the end.&apos; He may have a few short-term options, but the long-term prognosis for him and his family is very difficult. Apart from the fact an amnesty is unlikely to stick for ever, whoever takes over in Libya is sure to want to go after Gaddafi&apos;s money.&quot; The Libyan high command has until 4 May before Moreno-Ocampo reports to the security council. &quot;He hopes to make an application for arrest warrants shortly after that,&quot; says his spokeswoman. &quot;That could be anything from weeks to months. The big challenge is to implement the arrest warrants. It is then up to the member states to fulfil their side.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/31/rise-hi-tech-vending-machine", "publicationDate": "2011-03-31T19:30:00Z", "tags": ["Retail industry", "Business", "Japan", "UK news", "Technology", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["A Taiwanese company recently developed a vending machine with face-recognition cameras to help it recommend hair-growing tonics and razors to men."], "title": "The rise of the hi-tech vending machine", "article": "In the early 1990s, environmental campaigners in Japan used to highlight the fact that the nation&apos;s 3.6m vending machines collectively used electricity equal to the output of one nuclear power station. Such a comparison holds extra poignancy today, of course, especially when you consider there are now twice the number of vending machines in the country that famously just can&apos;t get enough of them. In fact, with the country experiencing rolling blackouts following the earthquake on 11 March, a grassroots campaign was launched to persuade Coca-Cola to switch off its 980,000 vending machines to help conserve energy. An executive from another drinks firm was quick to retaliate: &quot;But vending machines constitute a lifeline for residents.&quot; Are vending machines now such an essential component of our instant-fix, consumer lifestyles that we can&apos;t do without them, even in an emergency? &quot;There is one vending machine for every 23 people in Japan,&quot; says Jonathan Hilder, chief executive of the Automatic Vending Association. &quot;They are the biggest vending market in the world and there is a machine on every street corner selling anything from drinks and live crabs to music and underwear. In the UK, there is a vending machine for every 55 people. But expect vending machines to get ever-more commonplace as they get ever-more sophisticated.&quot; Vending has come a long way since the ancient Greeks relied on Hero&apos;s coin-operated machine to dispense holy water at temples. The first machines appeared in the UK during the late Victorian era, selling postcards before moving on to the ubiquitous machines we see today selling items such as chocolate bars, stamps and cigarettes (soon to be outlawed) that are found in railway stations and other busy public places. The thing that defines these vending machines is their crude, mechanical simplicity and invariable reluctance \u2013 despite often receiving a Fonz-like whack from the frustrated purchaser&apos;s clenched fist \u2013 to accept coins without rejecting at least a third of them. (The introduction of new 5p and 10p coins by the Royal Mint was recently delayed until next year after lobbying by the vending industry saying it would cost \u00a317m to recalibrate all its machines.) Hilder says the common perception that vending machines &quot;don&apos;t accept most coins&quot; is now largely false. &quot;The technology has come on enormously in recent years,&quot; he says. &quot;And don&apos;t blame it all on the industry: 2.8% of \u00a31 coins are forgeries. &quot;More than seven billion products are vended in the UK each year. The machines offer superb convenience in an age when we crave convenience.&quot; The staples will always be popular, but vending is undergoing a revolution in terms of the range of items machines offer, as well as how they are operated. For example, hot drinks are the most popular vended item in the UK today, with 60% of vending machines now found in the workplace. &quot;It&apos;s not so much that you can get a hot drink now \u2013 that&apos;s been the case for years \u2013 but the variety on offer is fast increasing,&quot; says Hilder. &quot;In the past five years, there&apos;s been a boom in larger drink sizes, with 9oz and even 12oz cups becoming the norm. And rather than rely on instant coffee, some machines are even grinding their own coffee beans.&quot; The gentrification of vending reflects our ever-demanding and discerning tastes elsewhere across food and drink retailing. But there is also another reason why the vending industry is keen to supersize and diversify its &quot;offerings&quot; \u2013 profit. The profit margin on a vended snack, such as a bar of chocolate or packet of crisps, is 30%-40%, says Hilder. But with coffee, the profit margin leaps to 70%. It is beyond food-and-drink vending, though, where the real innovation is to be found. For example, vending machines are now used to distribute methadone in some prisons \u2013 not for the convenience of the prisoner, but, by using retinal and fingerprint scanners on the machines, wardens say they can safely ensure it goes to the right person. A Taiwanese company recently developed a vending machine with face-recognition cameras to help it recommend hair-growing tonics and razors to men. And a Canadian firm is developing a &quot;remote-pharmacy dispensing&quot; machine with customers speaking to a real-life pharmacist via videophone before scanning their ID to get their medicines. In fact, improving security is now one of the principal reasons why retailers say they are turning to vending machines: Selfridges has trialled vending designer jeans following a spate of thefts. And increased security also allows retailers to sell things they would never dare normally sell over the counter to the public. Somewhat perplexingly, gold bars are now even being vended in a handful of international airports. Hilder believes the blending together of security and convenience will mean the vending machine becomes an integral component of our 24-hour, instant-access lifestyles in the future. As mobile-phone technology improves, and payment systems move towards &quot;wave pay&quot; (as with London&apos;s Oyster card), vending points in public and workplaces will be used both as places to buy goods directly, but also as delivery points for online shopping \u2013 a cross between a left-luggage locker and a conventional vending machine. &quot;Most new vending machines now are touch-screen, giving users a wealth of information and options,&quot; says Hilder. &quot;And once a universal wave-pay system is adopted \u2013 which will be about five to 10 years away \u2013 the options will be incredible for what can be vended.&quot; But until that day arrives, food and drink will continue to dominate vending. Earlier this month, Coca-Cola revealed a new drinks vending machine it claimed had been in development for six years. Called the &quot;Freestyle&quot;, the touch-screen machine offers up to 106 varieties of beverage. At its launch in Atlanta, the company&apos;s director of marketing offered some bold claims for the machine: &quot;To our knowledge there is nothing like this in the world. This is the future of fountain dispensing.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 1 April 2011.

All four discs captured the production in an almost-but-not-quite-finished state, with missing voiceovers and the odd &quot;note to self&quot; jotted in subtitles, reminding boffins and dubbers to fix this or that. But the crucial things \u2013 the script, the acting, the direction, the cinematography \u2013 were all there. I was hugely impressed. Parental pride at seeing &quot;my baby&quot; up there? I don&apos;t think so. The mere fact of my novel being filmed means very little to me. For a long while after The Crimson Petal&apos;s publication in 2002, it looked as though Hollywood was going to adapt it. The production team responsible for the Spider-Man franchise had bought the option, and rumours abounded that Kirsten Dunst would play my heroine Sugar. I could not have been less interested. Receiving updates on it from my publishers was like receiving news about a fashion expo in Taiwan. Who cares? The producer emailed me, asking me a trivial question about the Victorian era which I interpreted as a feeler to test whether I might get involved in some capacity. Mindful that Hollywood has a long history of wasting authors&apos; time, flattering them into writing screenplays which then get rewritten by half a dozen hacks, I responded with polite standoffishness. The project never got off the ground. But listen: I want to tell you a story. Imagine a girl who&apos;s been abused all her life, firstly by her mother and then by everyone else she meets. By the time she&apos;s 19, she&apos;s already been a prostitute for years. But she&apos;s smart. Very smart. One of her clients falls in love with her (or does he?) and puts her intelligence to good use helping him run his business. Lots of other stuff happens \u2013 it&apos;s a long story and I don&apos;t have much space to tell it \u2013 but after a while, this prostitute finds herself looking after a six-year-old child. Mothering her, if you like. But we all know that the cycle of abuse is vicious. Will she poison the soul of this little girl, the way her own mother poisoned hers? Last week, I watched this drama being acted out on TV. I saw a young woman embracing a child and I could tell, looking into that young woman&apos;s eyes, that she would sooner kill herself than harm that child. And my own eyes\u00a0prickled. The publicity surrounding the TV series of The Crimson Petal (BBC2 on Wednesdays) has focused, unsurprisingly, on the filth and the sex. The usual gallery of pundits has regurgitated the usual British squeamishness about bodily functions. Happily, there has also been praise for the actors \u2013 Chris O&apos;Dowd&apos;s William Rackham blowing away any misconception of O&apos;Dowd as &quot;merely&quot; a comic actor, Gillian Anderson&apos;s Mrs Castaway gleefully corroding any residual memory of the X-Files babe, Amanda Hale&apos;s Agnes giving you the creeps while stealing your sympathy. As Sugar, Romola Garai dons period costume yet again, lulling viewers into thinking they&apos;re in for another serving of Victorian nostalgia; instead, Garai takes them somewhere else entirely \u2013 into the psyche of a frighteningly damaged female, and on a journey that ends not in the boudoir but in the nursery. Scriptwriter Lucinda Coxon, in cutting the 850-page narrative down to filmable size, has wisely decided that at heart, it&apos;s about parental nurture or the lack of it \u2013 about grownups who are really overgrown children in search of lost or absent mothers, and the children that they in turn produce. I had feared that any film or TV adaptation of The Crimson Petal would discard this theme as uninteresting, and instead generate the drama from Sugar&apos;s rise through society: the ruthless, beautiful courtesan who claws her way to the top. Maybe that&apos;s the drama most people would have preferred to see. Maybe the risks that Coxon and director Marc Munden have taken, in creating something that&apos;s so different from the norm, will lose them their audience. I hope not. When answering questions, over the years, about film and TV adaptations of my books, I have always maintained that no movie or TV series could ever change or damage my work. The Crimson Petal and the White is a book, and it will win or lose the trust of each reader when they begin reading its pages. That relationship will go on. But, to my surprise, I&apos;ve just seen something on TV that I feel has its own artistic integrity and its own emotional power. It&apos;s someone else&apos;s baby, but damn it, I care how it gets treated."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/apr/06/imf-capital-controls", "publicationDate": "2011-04-06T21:00:00Z", "tags": ["International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Financial crisis", "Global economy", "Business", "Global recession", "World news", "Currencies", "Interest rates", "Global development"], "sentences": ["Their analysis of the recent use and modest success of controls by nations like Brazil confirms a preliminary analysis by one of us published last month where Kevin Gallagher found that controls in Brazil and Taiwan were associated with a reduction in the pace of currency appreciation and with helping those nations achieve a more independent monetary policy."], "title": "The IMF's welcome rethink on capital controls | Kevin Gallagher and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ocampo", "article": "In contrast to most western governments, over the past two years, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has boldly conducted one of the most honest self-assessments of its actions leading up to the financial crisis, has become somewhat critical of inflation-targeting and has endorsed the use of capital controls. In March of this year, the IMF held a full conference on rethinking macroeconomics where its organisers concluded that the crisis has shattered the economic orthodoxy behind the fund&apos;s previous policies.  In preparation for its annual meetings next week, on Tuesday the IMF took its work on capital controls a step further by issuing two reports (one official report and one staff discussion paper) outlining when nations should use capital controls, and what types of capital controls should be used under the proper circumstances. The new reports amount to yet another big step forward for the IMF \u2013 though there is still a long way to go.  In February 2010 the IMF changed its stance on capital controls because IMF economists&apos; own analyses found that, over and again, when developing countries used capital controls, they worked. Indeed, the IMF found that those nations that used capital controls were among the least hard-hit during the crisis. In a nutshell, the newest IMF report on controls does three things. First, it shows how post crisis capital flows to developing nations have been dominated by volatile portfolio flows and have therefore been destabilising, and that some nations resorted to capital controls to cope with those flows, with some success. Second, it importantly proposes a new nomenclature for capital controls, referring to them as capital flow management measures (CFMs). Third, it puts forth a set of guidelines for when nations should (and should not) deploy such measures and what form CFMs should take. The first two components of the report are landmark for the IMF. The IMF has now recognised that capital flows can be destabilising \u2013 causing currency appreciation, asset bubbles and volatility \u2013 for developing countries. Their analysis of the recent use and modest success of controls by nations like Brazil confirms a preliminary analysis by one of us published last month where Kevin Gallagher found that controls in Brazil and Taiwan were associated with a reduction in the pace of currency appreciation and with helping those nations achieve a more independent monetary policy. The IMF has also recognised that referring to these measures as capital &quot;controls&quot; brings great stigma. In earlier work, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ocampo has referred to such measures as &quot;capital account regulations&quot;, and other colleagues have called them &quot;capital management techniques&quot; (pdf) to the same end. Where the report is lacking is in the IMF&apos;s determination of the efficacy of CFMs and what types should be used. The report recommends that CFMs be used as a last resort and as a temporary measure, and only after a nation has accumulated sufficient reserves, tinkered with interest rates and let its currency appreciate. When measures are used, the IMF suggests that CFMs not discriminate against the residency of a capital flow. This has not been well-received in developing world. Without the advice of the IMF, many nations have deployed CFMs, both discriminatory and nondiscriminatory, alongside a host of other macroeconomic and macro-prudential policies as they have seen appropriate. And according to the IMF&apos;s own research, CFMs have been a success \u2013 even though they have sometimes not met those guidelines. Interestingly, the accompanying IMF staff discussion paper is somewhat less strident, saying:  &quot;there is no unambiguous welfare ranking of policy instruments (though nondiscriminatory prudential measures are always appropriate), and a pragmatic approach taking account of the economy&apos;s most pertinent risks and distortions needs to be adopted.&quot;  What is also disappointing from the report is what is not there. Even more importantly for setting guidelines for the use of CFMs, the IMF should focus at least equally on helping nations enforce such measures when they deem them appropriate. Many CFMs only work partially and for a short time because controls are evaded by foreign investors. Designing a regime to help nations enforce CFMs would be a welcome addition to the global financial system. Particularly important in this regard is to undo the de facto regime consisting of a tangled web of trade treaties that outlaw many CFMs. This is also linked to the fact that the report does not follow through the implications of the statement that &quot;the onus of policy adjustment from inflow surges rests solely on these countries.&quot; This is another area where the IMF could join a global debate (Gallagher has written on this with Stephany Griffith-Jones) on the extent to which capital account regulations could be coordinated on a global level \u2013 indeed, as part of the global process to re-regulate finance. It&apos;s worth recalling that in the meetings that led up to the establishment of the IMF, both Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes agreed (pdf) that capital controls be targeted at &quot;both ends&quot; of a capital flow. The IMF is to be applauded for taking another step towards a more integrative and development-friendly approach to global finance. It still has a way to go."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/08/unruly-pupils-teachers-strike", "publicationDate": "2011-04-08T06:00:04Z", "tags": ["Education", "Pupil behaviour", "Schools", "Teaching", "Secondary schools", "UK news", "US politics", "World news", "US news", "Barack Obama"], "sentences": ["But according to a much-publicised survey, carried out in (of all places) Taiwan, old men who go shopping last longer than old men who don&apos;t.

Or is it the teachers who are failing? | Alexander Chancellor", "article": "For teachers to go on strike because their pupils are badly behaved is rather like policemen striking because there are criminals about; or priests doing so because they have to deal with sinners; or me doing so because my Jack Russell barks at the postman. We are all in positions of care in which bad behaviour is something we are expected to deal with. The 70-plus teachers at Darwen Vale high school in Lancashire, who stopped work on Thursday and picketed the building, were insistent therefore that they were not striking against their pupils, who were described even by a local NUT official on the picketline as &quot;no better or no worse&quot; than any others, but against the school&apos;s management, including its recently appointed head, Hilary Torpey, whom they said were not giving them the necessary support. It is an odd situation, because inspectors who visited the school only last June said the behaviour of students was good, whereas the teaching staff complain of a sort of St Trinian&apos;s-like hell. They say pupils swear at them, shove and push them, challenge them to fights, make malicious allegations, and film them during lessons with mobile phones, threatening to post the videos online (what can the videos show that makes them such a threat?). The pupils may perhaps be like the girls of St Trinian&apos;s and take care to be on best behaviour in the presence of outsiders. But Ms Torpey also takes the view that &quot;the vast majority of pupils at Darwen Vale behave well and take their education seriously&quot;. So where does the truth lie? The press accounts provide no satisfactory answer, and the only reported teachers&apos; complaint of management&apos;s failure to\u00a0support their efforts to impose discipline concerns the pupils&apos; mobile phones. The teachers say the phones they confiscate get returned by the management to the pupils, leaving them feeling &quot;totally undermined&quot;. Well, the reports don&apos;t say how quickly they are returned, but the phones are presumably the pupils&apos; property and must be returned some time. Why not make a rule saying they may not bring them to school? It sounds to me as if the school is suffering from chronic uncertainty about how to enforce discipline. One suspects that the management, cherishing the school&apos;s reputation, doesn&apos;t want to believe pupils are as disorderly as alleged. But one also suspects that the teachers are blaming the management for their own inability to control a class. It&apos;s an interesting case that deserves some serious study. Can we do without government? It was sometimes said that one of the worst things that ever happened to the world was the invention of air conditioning, because it meant that, instead of closing down during the unbearably hot summer months, the government in Washington went on meddling in other countries&apos; affairs without a break throughout the year. If only the US federal government would settle for the inertia that Gilbert and Sullivan found so praiseworthy in the House of Lords, everything might yet be all right. In the song from Iolanthe, When Britain Really Ruled the Waves, Lord Mountararat maintained that the periods of Britain&apos;s greatest glory always coincided with times when the upper house was at its most indolent. As the last verse goes, &quot;And while the House of Peers withholds/ Its legislative hand, /And noble statesmen do not itch/ To interfere with matters which/ They do not understand,/As bright will shine Great Britain&apos;s rays/ As in King George&apos;s glorious days!&quot; etc. If only the US government would allow itself a similar pause from interference, the rest of the world might benefit. At the time of writing, there is still a\u00a0sporting chance that the federal government may shut down at midnight on Friday because of a stalemate between Republicans and Democrats over the size of spending cuts in the federal budget. If it happens, about 800,000 government employees will be suspended and government activity will be sharply reduced. It sounds very hopeful, but it turns out unfortunately that the government will be careful to shut down only the nice things it does and keep the less attractive ones going. It won&apos;t, for example, stop shooting Afghans, but it will close national parks and cancel the Cherry Blossom parade in Washington DC. This last would be another blow to poor old Japan, for the annual parade celebrates the famous gift of Japanese cherry trees to Washington by the mayor of Tokyo in 1912. So it won&apos;t much matter if, as President Obama has been predicting, a last-minute settlement is reached and the shutdown is avoided. In fact, it might be a good thing. The last shutdown, in 1995, also had one consequence that might be taken as a bad omen. As the Guardian recalled on Thursday, it meant that Monica Lewinsky stayed on duty in the White House with only a skeleton staff to observe her. Shop to live Although I&apos;m 71, it looks as if I may live for a while yet because I am always going shopping. I hate it. I only do it because I have to. But according to a much-publicised survey, carried out in (of all places) Taiwan, old men who go shopping last longer than old men who don&apos;t. You might think it would kill us off sooner, but apparently not. It staves off loneliness and promotes psychological health. Rubbish, obviously.

As recent moves by Acer and Google show, it&apos;s high time to bury the netbook as a fad born out of desperation rather than a true evolution of mobile computing. Just a few years ago as PC companies confronted the abyss of the world&apos;s worst recession since the 1920s, they realized they needed lower-priced products to avoid having sales plummet along with the stock market. They also noticed the same trend that many of us have toward mobility, with factors like weight and battery life becoming as important if not more to consumers as processing power and large screens. Thus was born the netbook: a slimmed down notebook PC running Windows XP or Windows 7 Starter with a cramped keyboard and a smaller screen, generally between 7 inches and 10 inches available for around $299 or $399. For a while, it seemed netbooks could be a bridge to a mobile future, especially when combined with supports from wireless carriers like Verizon and AT&amp;T. But then came the iPad, which made it clear that demand for screens larger than a smartphone was going to be fulfilled by devices born of the new era of mobile. This is what Steve Jobs is talking about when he talks of a &quot;post-PC era&quot; that the legacy technologies of the PC era simply can&apos;t be crammed into smaller packages. Ever since, netbook sales have been stagnating, even falling. And two developments this week allow us to start putting nails in the coffin. Acer, which recently dumped its CEO amid exposure to falling netbook sales, released pricing information for its new Android tablet and told investors in Taiwan that &quot;we may not be able to get back to the golden days, as notebook plus netbook may be only able to maintain single-digit growth compared to 20 to 30 percent in the past,&quot; according to Bloomberg. This week code surfaced that Google is also readying tablet-friendly features for Chrome OS, once pitched as an ideal Netbook companion but now increasingly labeled as a &quot;notebook&quot; operating system on Google&apos;s Chrome OS product page. There&apos;s just not room in the computing world for a device that is a compromise in every single way except price. Smaller screens and less-than-optimal keyboards make netbooks harder to use for work and play. Windows simply wasn&apos;t meant to run on devices that last for eight hours without huge and heavy extended batteries. The margins on netbooks are terrible.  Google has a shot at correcting many of these objections by tackling the netbook in a truly new way, but it may not matter if the world decides that the form factor is destined for a niche role. Imagine the Christmas shopper in November 2011 considering their computing options: why pick the netbook? Tablets offer a more intuitive user experience at similar prices, cheap but full-sized notebooks won&apos;t cost all that much more than the netbook (Best Buy&apos;s Web site currently offers 70 laptops less than $600, more than any other category), and given that hardware vendors simply aren&apos;t motivated anymore to invest in netbooks given their low margins and the emergence of the tablet in the consumer mindset, there&apos;s not likely to be a lot of new and different things on store shelves. Google&apos;s hope is that corporations embrace Chrome OS netbooks as a more secure-and-reliable low-cost option for their workers, but that has always seemed like more of a sales pitch from Google than true demand that Google is poised to capture. Acer initially said upon the departure of CEO Gianfranco Lanci that it would invest &quot;cautiously&quot; in the mobile market, but just a week later Wang appears to have thrown caution to the wind, saying that Acer now has an &quot;aggressive&quot; plan to go after the tablet market. Every industry has its fads. Google will likely try to revive interest in Netbooks when Chrome OS is finally ready, and a more sophisticated version of the CR-48 prototype Netbook could turn a few heads. But more and more, it seems like the mobile world has moved on, which could accelerate internal tension between Android and Chrome OS inside Google.

The company has been relying on inventories and hopes to restart production at the end of April, but a spokesman said it was likely that clients had been affected. On average, analysts expect global mobile phone sales volumes to have grown 10.8% in the first quarter of 2011, according to 18 analysts polled by Reuters. The market recovered from a slump in 2009 to see a total of 302.6m smartphones worldwide, up 74.4% from the 173.5m shipped in 2009, according to research firm IDC. However, the poll found financial analysts now think it will only grow by 9% this year \u2013 although Gartner&apos;s previous full-year forecast before the quake was for 58% growth, which could at worst now be held back to just over 50%. Analysts also expect that of the major handset makers only Apple will have grown its market share when it announces its results. It is expected to have sold 15.8m iPhones in the first quarter, up 81% from a year ago. Samsung is reckoned to have sold about 13m smartphones, and Korea&apos;s LG about 4m. Both have benefited from the growing appetite for low-cost phones running Google&apos;s Android operating system. Sony Ericsson&apos;s reliance on Japanese production, especially by Sony, means the quake&apos;s effects are limiting production volume of its arc, Play and neo smartphones \u2013 delaying the wider launch of the neo to the third quarter. &quot;Given these three devices are central to Sony Ericsson&apos;s relatively narrow 2011 portfolio, there is likely to be considerable concern about the financial implications,&quot; said CCS&apos;s Wood. Sony Ericsson warned in January of a weak first quarter as it struggled to fill an awkward hole in its product portfolio. The company has to cut the prices of its old models to maintain its market position, analysts said. &quot;Older products will have to be discounted to remain somewhat relevant. Sony Ericsson really needs the new products to get to the market and ramp up quickly,&quot; Milanesi said. Nokia also warned last month it would have shortages of some of its phones as the quake is set to cause industry-wide shortage of components and raw materials sourced from Japan, but said the impact on earnings would be limited.

What is it, we ask Taiwanese ambassador Siao-Yue Chang, that makes tapioca floating in a milk-based tea such a fitting standard bearer for her nation? &quot;Like Taiwan, bubble tea is sweet and has universal appeal,&quot; she tells the Guardian, &quot;and makes beverages without the soft and chewy tapioca balls that are its namesake dull and bland by comparison.&quot; Take that, lapsang souchong! &quot;This ingenious combination of tea and tapioca is representative of Taiwanese creative spirit ...&quot; Yes, yes. \u2712Yesterday&apos;s item on the Hitchens brothers prompts reader Richard Heller to mail his fond recollections of Oxford in the late 60s, where everyone&apos;s favourite left-a-bit, right-a-bit polemicist Christopher was a contemporary. Back then, of course, young Hitchens&apos;s politics were unambiguous. &quot;Night after night in the late 1960s he used the well-upholstered Balliol JCR to argue for the true path to socialism and plot insurrections against the capitalist system and its handmaidens, the College and University authorities. Since most of his audience were drunk, stoned or playing all-night poker, he was forced to acquire high skills in rhetoric and argument to rouse them.&quot; Imagine his dismay, therefore, to hear of the recent defeat of a motion to declare Hitchens a &quot;hero&quot; of the JCR. Alas, it being the Easter break and with the college&apos;s students off in Klosters or occupying something, we are unable to demand an explanation. \u2712Bad news for the organisers of &quot;Radical Media&quot;, a conference planned for October and intended, among other things, to promote dialogue between activists and mass media. Conference planners, including the New Internationalist, Peace News and Red Pepper, have received a letter demanding a name change from a US-based company called ... Radical Media. &quot;We are a transmedia company that develops, produces and distributes TV shows, films, commercials, brand identities, advertising concepts, digital content and event-based entertainment,&quot; declares its site. Radical.

(Don&apos;t be sad. There may be other stuff to read about her in the coming fortnight.) Our scene is St Andrews, where Wills, Kate, a chap called Fergus who never talks to the press and &quot;one other student who has never been identified&quot; are sharing a house. William grants an interview: &quot;Everybody thinks I drink beer, but I actually like cider.&quot; A society photographer spills his secrets: &quot;It&apos;s amazing when I think back that I was never able to photograph Kate, let alone William.&quot; Somehow, happily, the pair get it together.

Sex and Zen 3D: Extreme Ecstasy packed cinemas across Hong Kong yesterday as curious filmgoers flocked to see the highly hyped movie for themselves. The film, set at the raunchy court of Ming-dynasty ancient China, is a sequel to an earlier Chinese movie, 1991&apos;s Sex and Zen, which remains Hong Kong&apos;s highest-grossing adult film. &quot;It depends on the box office of 3D Sex and Zen, but we&apos;re hoping the sequel will start production as soon as the end of 2011 with an all-new cast,&quot; producer Stephen Shiu Jr told the Hollywood Reporter.

The film has also attracted tourists from mainland China, where the movie is unlikely to screen without severe cuts due to strict censorship laws. Justin Lai, 32, said she was curious to see what 3D porn looked like on the big screen. &quot;I&apos;m not normally much of a moviegoer, but this one is just too good to miss,&quot; she told AFP as she waited to see the film at a cinema in the busy Causeway Bay entertainment district. The 113-minute, $2m Cantonese-language film has been handed a category III rating by Hong Kong censors, which means it cannot be seen by under-18s. It stars two of Japan&apos;s best-known adult actors, Yukiko Suo and Saori Hara. An ornate fantasy with high production values, the film is ostensibly based on the classic Chinese erotic text The Carnal Prayer Mat and follows a young man as he befriends a duke and enters a world of royal romps. Its success suggests similar 3D fare could be on the way as the industry attempts to find new ways to make money in an era of free internet porn. Italian director Tinto Brass is reportedly planning a 3D version of his salacious 1979 effort Caligula, while Hustler magazine wants to shoot a 3D porn spoof of James Cameron&apos;s Avatar.

That, say the writers at Digitimes, has led to concerns among other companies including Asus and HTC that demand is not strong enough to make it worthwhile for them to compete. That is allied to problems with supply. Earlier this week the Guardian revealed that Apple, HTC, Huawei and Samsung had secured supplies of essential components following the Japan earthquake in March, but that other companies were now facing constraints for smartphone elements. That seems to have been extended to tablet components, probably including batteries. Asus has put samples of its Eee Pad Transformer tablets into the hands of reviewers, including the Guardian, though UK release dates have slipped by a few weeks to late April, and further in Taiwan itself. HTC is reportedly putting off volume production of its Flyer tablet computers after losing out in the race to get larger touch panels.  Paradoxically, the absence of strong competitors to the iPad could be a problem for Apple, which is trying to carve out a new market in &quot;media tablets&quot;, as analysts have dubbed devices such as the iPad and Xoom.

All of the company&apos;s numbers were down compared to a year ago, except for the average price of a handset sold, which rose by 5% to \u20ac141. Revenues fell by 18%, while net income fell by 48%, though the previous year&apos;s figure was boosted by a tax benefit. The number of handsets sold fell to 8.1m, down 26%. The group also borrowed \u20ac375m in the quarter as it saw cash flow outward, meaning that its cash borrowings of \u20ac604m now exceed its cash holdings of \u20ac599m. The company estimated its market share for smartphones during the quarter was about 5% in units and 3% in value. &quot;The Japan earthquake made it a challenging quarter operationally and we are experiencing some disruptions to our supply chain,&quot; chief executive Bert Nordberg said in a statement. Sony Ericsson is now pinning its hopes on its Xperia Play, arc and neo smartphones \u2013 but supplies have been hit by the disruption in Japan, which has delayed launches and constrained volumes. &quot;The second quarter and possibly third will be difficult because of Japan,&quot; said Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber said shipments in the past quarter had fallen &quot;a considerable way short of expectations&quot; adding: &quot;This is a challenging situation for Sony Ericsson, but with lowered operating expenses and continued improvement to gross margin, it is at least in a better position to weather the storm than it was 12 to 24 months ago.&quot; Analysts claim 2011 could be a crucial year for the 10-year-old joint venture between Japan&apos;s Sony and Sweden&apos;s Ericsson, which was hit hard by the arrival of Apple&apos;s iPhone in mid-2007 and then by the proliferation of cheaper Android smartphones. Sony Ericsson has slashed costs \u2013 including cutting around 4,000 jobs \u2013 and refocused on higher margin smartphones that link to social networking sites such as Facebook. Smartphones as a percentage of sales rose to 60%, from 40% in the previous quarter. The company forecasts modest growth in total units in the global handset market for 2011. But analysts say it still takes too long for the group to bring new products to market and it has been left trailing by the likes of Apple, and Korea&apos;s Samsung and Taiwan&apos;s HTC, which make Android phones. IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said the group \u2013 which dropped behind HTC to ninth-largest phone maker by volume \u2013 risks remaining a niche player if it does not expand its offering beyond the top end of the market. &quot;They are not Apple. I do not see a bright future for them if they do not do more,&quot; Jeronimo said. Other global companies have also recently highlighted the impact of the earthquake.

The production of the new iPhone will start in July or August and the smartphone will look largely similar to the iPhone 4, one of the sources told Reuters. The iPhone \u2013 introduced in 2007 with the touchscreen, on-demand application template now adopted by its rivals \u2013 remains the gold standard in the booming smartphone market. Reports on the timeline of the new iPhone launch vary, though it is largely expected that Apple will likely refresh its iPhone 4 later this year. It was introduced in June 2010 by chief executive Steve Jobs and shipped in the same month. The timing would mean a delay from the usual 12-month refresh cycle for the iPhone since its introduction in 2007, when new versions have been shown off at Apple&apos;s Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco. That is presently scheduled for 6-10 June. The sources declined to be identified because the plans for the new iPhone were not yet public. An Apple spokeswoman in Hong Kong was not available for comment. The iPhone is one of Apple&apos;s most successful products, with more than 16 million sold in the last quarter of 2010. It accounted for more than a third of the company&apos;s sales in the quarter. Apple sources many of its components from Taiwan-based suppliers, many are expected to benefit from a rise in sales as some of them rely on the US company for about 20-40% of their business, said Vincent Chen, an analyst at Yuanta Securities. &quot;For some suppliers, Apple is their cash cow, or their bread and butter,&quot; Chen said. &quot;With all these versions being launched so frequently, it will be the so-called low-margin suppliers, such as those that assemble the phones, who will benefit the most.&quot; Suppliers to the new iPhone include camera module maker Largan Precision, touchscreen panel maker Wintek Corp and case maker Foxconn Technology, two of the people said. The companies would begin production either in July or August before shipping components to Hon Hai Precision Industry, flagship of Foxconn, for assembly, they said. Officials at Largan, Wintek and Foxconn declined to comment. On Wednesday, Largan&apos;s Taipei-listed shares ended up 3.7%, Hon Hai rose 4.3% and Foxconn rose 6.6%, outpacing the benchmark Taiex share index&apos;s 2% advance. Apple, a big purchaser of touchscreen displays and flash memory, is also dependent on Japan for some of its key components, sparking concern that the disruption due to the crisis there may hurt its gross margins. But other reports have suggested it moved quickly after the earthquake in March to secure supplies from other sources. Apple is expected to report another spectacular quarter on Wednesday evening, tempered by growing caution over how supply constraints will squeeze margins and restrain iPhone and iPad sales. Early estimates suggest it will have sold 18m iPhones and between 4m and 7m iPads in the quarter."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2011/apr/20/k-pop-south-korea-music-market", "publicationDate": "2011-04-20T16:21:46Z", "tags": ["Media business", "Digital media", "Media", "Music industry", "Business", "Music", "Culture"], "sentences": ["It&apos;s also big in countries such as the Philippines, Taiwan, Singapore, China and Japan."], "title": "K-pop: how South Korea turned round its music scene", "article": "South Korean music has, traditionally, never been on the radar of major labels and publishers. Being one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world (out of a population of 48.6 million, 39.4 million use the internet), the country&apos;s music industry suffered from rampant piracy for most of the past decade. There was little revenue to be collected internally, and there wasn&apos;t much demand for Korean artists outside the territory. Though Universal Music Group opened an office in the country over a decade ago, the only local artists it would invest in were classical ones. But about four years ago \u2013 when, perhaps not so coincidentally, South Korea introduced anti-piracy legislation \u2013 Pelle Lidell, European A&amp;R executive of the company&apos;s publishing arm, turned his attention to pitching songs written by his roster of largely Scandinavian and British songwriters to Korean artists. Today UMG considers Korea to be one of the most important territories \u2013 and it&apos;s all because of K-pop. The K-pop phenomenon emerged at the beginning of the last decade, with Korean music production houses taking the concept of pop factories to levels way beyond The X Factor. Companies such as SM Entertainment and Play Cube Entertainment tapped into the 360 degree model way before the major labels \u2013 being independent record labels, talent agencies and publishers with their own academies where they groom young teenagers to be pop stars. SME even has its own merchandise store in Seoul. The SM Entertainment building, set in what Lidell calls &quot;the coolest youth district&quot; of the city, contains a coffee shop, luxury restaurant, a section where you can take pictures that look like you&apos;re sitting with the SME stars, and a store for SME artist memorabilia. Though 55% of Korean music sales are digital, the company makes sure that physical CDs are attractive enough for the fans to splurge on them as well. It doesn&apos;t release records in ordinary CD cases; they&apos;re all in glossy luxury packaging. They&apos;re often released in up to five different packages \u2013 and the fans buy them all. To call SME an independent is almost misleading, as the company has 250 employees and has sold more than 59m records in the last year alone. &quot;What UK label sells that many records of local repertoire in a year?&quot; asks Lidell. &quot;They&apos;re the biggest in Korea. Today, many of the biggest US artists and songwriters, like will.i.am and Sean Garrett, shuttle back and forth to work with Korean acts.&quot; He adds: &quot;I&apos;ve never had a single release [in Korea] that has sold less than 400,000. Mirotic, a single by the group TVXQ sold around 2m in Korea and Japan (the group call themselves Tohoshinki in Japan). SME boy band Super Junior is Korean, but they&apos;ve also put together a Super Junior in China. So sometimes when I get a cut with a song I&apos;ll make three different adaptations: Korean, Japanese and Chinese.&quot; There&apos;s also a lot of sync income in Korea. The song Top Billing Love \u2013 written by Karen Poole, Bloodshy and Avant, responsible for hits for artists like Kylie and Britney \u2013 almost made it onto a Britney Spears album in 2002. SME did a deal with mobile phone manufacturer LG and its biggest girl groups, Girls&apos; Generation and FX, did a version each of the song, calling it Chocolate Love, since LG were launching a new brown phone. Girls&apos; Generation&apos;s version went straight to number one. A few weeks later they released the FX version , which also went to number one. Then they released a joint version for LG, which also went to the top of the charts. It took a bit longer for the recording side of UMG to get involved with K-pop. &quot;It&apos;s only in the past two years that we&apos;ve seen proper growth in revenue from Korea,&quot; says Sandy Monteiro, the president of UMG International in South East Asia. &quot;Investing in this kind of artist development is not cheap. Though local classical artists are more niche, they&apos;re a safer bet and require a tiny investment compared to K-pop acts. There are so many companies working with what we call &apos;the Idol format&apos;, so you&apos;ve got a fight on your hands. But on 1 January last year we took the plunge.&quot; That&apos;s when UMG decided to invest in Play Cube Entertainment, resulting in the label&apos;s K-pop sales jumping from 9% of total Korean sales to 29% in 2010. But K-pop isn&apos;t just a success in its country of birth. It&apos;s also big in countries such as the Philippines, Taiwan, Singapore, China and Japan. While Play Cube&apos;s biggest act, boy band Beast, reached six-times-platinum sales in Korea alone, it also sold gold in most other south-east Asian markets. Its biggest girl group, 4Minute, isn&apos;t far behind. &quot;Beast are as big in South East Asia as Backstreet Boys were in the west, 15 years ago,&quot; says Monteiro. Idol sales represent about 40% of all music sales in Korea, but they make up the bulk of all sales of Korean music in the rest of south-east Asia. That&apos;s why UMG is now also licensing Korean repertoire that is not signed to the label, including some of SME&apos;s acts, to countries outside Korea. &quot;[The K-pop production houses] tend to be quite mercenary. But they&apos;ve realised the value of partnering with a stable set-up like ours.&quot; Monteiro doubts K-pop will ever become as big in countries like the US and UK, as music fans in those markets would just be too critical about the lyrics and the acts&apos; accents when singing in English. That, however, doesn&apos;t seem to be a major problem considering that while UK revenue from record sales shrunk by more than 11% in 2010, Korean overall sales were up 11.7%. This is why, at a recent industry event in Abu Dhabi, UMG&apos;s head of digital, Rob Wells, indicated that K-pop was high on the label&apos;s list of priorities, and Monteiro says UMG is planning to double its investment in Korea. The fact that South Korea has very strict anti-piracy laws \u2013 including a three-strike rule for illegal downloaders \u2013 has helped turn around the fortunes of the country&apos;s music industry. But UMG&apos;s Korean managing director, Beom-Joon Yang, believes that there&apos;s more to it. &quot;We think the combined popularity of Korean megastar icons like Rain, Korean television soap dramas, top-quality music production in Korea, and a genuine love for Korean culture overall around Asia, have attributed to making K-pop part of mainstream pop culture.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/apr/22/samsung-apple-lawsuits-smartphones", "publicationDate": "2011-04-22T12:27:34Z", "tags": ["iPhone", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Technology", "Apple", "Telecoms", "Business", "Samsung", "Smartphone patent wars"], "sentences": ["Nokia, BlackBerry maker Research in Motion and Sony Ericsson are affected by supply shortages, while others including Apple, Samsung, HTC and China&apos;s Huawei are thought to have acted quickly to secure supplies from China, Taiwan and Korea instead."], "title": "Samsung counter-sues Apple over battle for \u00a3100bn smartphone industry", "article": "Samsung Electronics has hit back against Apple with a tit-for-tat lawsuit a week after the US group accused its South Korean rival of &quot;slavishly&quot; copying designs of its iPhone and iPad.

The move comes days before it launches a new version of its Galaxy S smartphone, and is the first against Apple, its biggest client as well as a rival. The South Korean electronics maker supplies Apple with microchips, memory chips and other parts. Analysts say Apple would struggle to find a supplier of the same calibre. Samsung&apos;s Galaxy smartphones and tablet computers, which use Google&apos;s Android operating system, have emerged as the main competitors to Apple&apos;s iPhone and iPad. Apple sold 18.6m iPhones in the last quarter, while Samsung has startled rivals with the rapid growth of its smartphone sales and is estimated to have shifted 13m handsets between January and March. It aims to sell 60m smartphones this year. &quot;Apple is quite annoyed by Samsung&apos;s fast rise in a market which it virtually created,&quot; James Song, an analyst at Daewoo Securities, said. &quot;It&apos;s quite threatening to see how quickly Samsung plays catch-up, and Apple might have felt a strong urge to put a brake on its march just when Samsung is set to roll out a new smartphone in May ahead of its new iPhone.&quot; Samsung said on Friday that it was &quot;responding actively to the legal action taken against us in order to protect our intellectual property&quot;.Apple filed a lawsuit against Samsung a week ago, claiming that its Galaxy design features copy the iPhone and iPad. Its spokeswoman Kristin Huguet said then: &quot;This kind of blatant copying is wrong.&quot; The US company brought 16 claims against Samsung, including unjust enrichment, trademark infringement and 10 patent claims. But Samsung insists that the design of its products is the result of its own research and development. The lawsuits are the latest in the fiercely competitive \u00a3100bn smartphone industry. Nokia has sued Apple, while the US company has brought suits against handset makers HTC and Motorola alleging patent infringement. The global smartphone market is set to grow by 58% this year, with Android devices expected to grow strongly, according to research firm Gartner. It estimates that the tablet market could quadruple to 70m units. The iPad will dominate in coming years, but its market share is expected to be eroded by Android devices and could fall from 69% this year to 47% in 2015. This year phone companies will struggle to obtain components after the Japanese earthquake led to factory closures. Experts say smartphone sales could drop by up to 5% as a result.

But modern humans carry within their tissues a different kind of evidence. DNA serves as a lineal history, a family album, a passport that bears the marks of both origin and journey. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is inherited only from the mother. Every few generations, a random mutation creeps into this familial signature. So comparison of two samples of mtDNA will show degrees of kinship and ancestral origin. Conversely, the Y chromosome \u2013 a twisted rope composed entirely of DNA \u2013 is inherited by males from the father. Random infrequent changes once again provide a way of estimating the number of generations back to a shared ancestor. The evidence of DNA reveals that all humans are very closely related. A Scot, a Japanese and an Australian Aborigine are far more closely linked by family inheritance than any three chimpanzees from different African groups. DNA research suggests that all surviving humans are descended from one woman who lived perhaps 200,000 years ago. Research also shows that the story begins in Africa, home to the greatest variation in human DNA, and therefore the oldest location. Accordingly the woman was promptly dubbed &quot;the African Eve&quot;. Not surprisingly, people of the same ethnic and linguistic group turn out to be genetically more closely related to each other than to the rest of the planet, but the same research shows a great deal of mixing of populations as well. Studies of telltale markers in the DNA sequence have been used to reconstruct the journeys of ancient human groups around the globe, and not just ancient humans. Along the way from East Africa to Easter Island, early human voyagers picked up fellow travellers such as the stomach ulcer bug Helicobacter pylori. This bacterium also carries a DNA signature of its origins. In 2009, it delivered an answer to one of the great mysteries of the human migration: all the settlers on the islands of Polynesia and Melanesia carried stomach bugs that their ancestors could only have picked up in Taiwan. So that became the jumping-off point for the colonisation of the Pacific. Long before agriculture, metalwork, settlement, writing, nationality and the idea of history, long before formal territorial identity or ethnic tradition, all humans had a scrapbook, a set of passport stamps that are now beginning to reveal some twists in the great human journey. The beginning remains a mystery. But the blood and flesh of humans and chimpanzees holds a molecular story-so-far, a cryptic chemical summary of the 6m-year human thriller. DNA is a new way of telling: the secrets of its decryption exposed in less than one human lifetime.

Photograph: Ng Han Guan/AFP/Getty Images    The expected announcement by former Utah Governor Jon Hunstman that he&apos;s entering the 2012 presidential race is certain to grab national headlines. Huntsman is a Republican, but since 2009, he&apos;s also served as President Obama&apos;s envoy to China. He supported the Obama stimulus package \u2013 a definite no-no for Tea Party types \u2013 but he&apos;s staunchly pro-life, and like former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, notably moderate on immigration and environmental issues. But unlike Huckabee, he&apos;s also expressed strong support for gay civil unions. But there&apos;s one aspect of Huntsman&apos;s biography that could stir even greater controversy: his ongoing affiliation with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), known to most as the Mormons. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, whom many still consider the Republican frontrunner \u2013 he&apos;s still leading the prospective GOP field by a wide margin in the bellwether New Hampshire primary \u2013 is also a Mormon, and, in fact, a devout one. In 2008, he tried to defuse the issue and possible opposition from Christian evangelicals, who have a long history of animosity toward Mormons, by giving a major speech on religion and politics, citing an earlier presidential aspirant, John F Kennedy, who faced fears over his Catholicism, and largely defused them. The jury&apos;s out on whether Romney&apos;s speech actually worked. Judging from the trouncing he suffered in Iowa at the hands of Huckabee, who galvanised the state&apos;s evangelical voters, probably not; though some political experts say it wasn&apos;t Romney&apos;s Mormonism, just his shortcomings as a candidate that doomed him there. Romney appears to have come away from the 2008 experience chastened, noting last year that some people will never be able to look past his religious faith. But since he failed to win the GOP nomination \u2013 and in fact, never really came close \u2013 how much of an albatross Mormonism was, or could be, for a national candidate was never put to a serious test. Polls, however, suggest that the American public is wary of Mormonism \u2013 in part, because they still know so little about it, but also because what they do know, they don&apos;t especially like. A 2007 Pew survey found that next to Muslims, Mormons were viewed with the most suspicion by American voters. Just 52% of Catholics and only 40% of white evangelicals said that they considered Mormons fellow &quot;Christians&quot;, and even those that did, suggested that Mormon views and their own were &quot;very different&quot;. And yet, ironically, in a separate Pew survey conducted last year, Mormons as well as Jews were found to have a far greater understanding of the bible and Christian teachings than adherents to mainstream Catholic and Protestant religions. (Atheists, bless their hearts, scored the highest.) Which brings us to Huntsman. Unlike Romney, he&apos;s long set a respectful boundary between himself and the church he grew up in. Though he once served as an LDS missionary in Taiwan, where he eventually studied and became fluent in Mandarin Chinese, unlike Romney, Huntsman did not attend Brigham Young University \u2013 widely considered the &quot;official&quot; LDS school \u2013 but enrolled at the University of Utah, which, though heavily influence by the LDS, still jealously guards its independence. Since then, the 50-year-old Huntsman has made a point of distancing himself even further, enrolling his children in Catholic school, and publicly extolling the virtues of many of the world&apos;s faiths. It&apos;s not even clear he&apos;s a practising Mormon still. So the big question for some is whether Huntsman&apos;s entry into the race is likely to defuse the issue of Mormonism, or further exacerbate the latent controversy that, for the most part, had largely died down since Romney&apos;s last run. Some conservatives are bristling at the suggestion that the issue matters at all, and in fact, the strongest opposition may not come from conservatives but from liberals who are growing increasingly wary of LDS influence over national politics. The LDS played a critical role in drumming up popular support for Proposition 8 banning gay marriage in California, and leading LDS figures, like Arizona state Senator Russell Pearce, are in the forefront of the nation&apos;s nativist backlash against illegal immigrants, even though, as I&apos;ve reported earlier, the current Utah governor and the LDS generally have also backed efforts to reach a bipartisan compromise on immigration, short of full-scale legalisation. Huntsman probably has far less to lose than Romney does, in fact. As a moderate, he&apos;s the &quot;dark horse&quot; choice of the GOP establishment, enjoying close ties to John McCain, but also, it turns out, to Sarah Palin, whose name he placed in nomination for the GOP vice presidency in 2008. Then, too, his efforts to distance himself from Mormonism could well defuse the issue in the minds of Christian evangelicals in key primary states like South Carolina and even Iowa where Huntsman reportedly has plans to compete. Romney, who&apos;s already flagging in the south, having recently lost in a straw poll to another GOP establishment representative, Haley Barbour (though he has now withdrawn), may well find that evangelicals remain cool to him, even as they warm to Huntsman. In an ideal world, of course, religious bigotry would have no place in American politics. But of course, it does \u2013 especially as the stakes rise and the dividing lines become more sharply defined. Should either Romney or Huntsman win the nomination, conservatives will quickly set aside their differences, including their internecine religious concerns, and concentrate on defeating Obama. But don&apos;t expect American liberals to do the same. Or even the general voting public, nearly a third of whom, regardless of political persuasion, say a candidate&apos;s Mormon views could affect their vote, according to Pew surveys. If you weren&apos;t already familiar with LDS founder Joseph P Smith \u2013 the man who considered himself a prophet on par with Jesus, espoused polygamy and had an estimated 30 wives, a third of them teenagers \u2013 you likely soon will be, if Romney and the GOP keep up their poll surge. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 June 2011.

In few other countries have the questions of how many people there are, and where and how they live mattered more for public policy. Last November, 6 million census workers interviewed 400 million households in China in the country&apos;s sixth national census. The first results, released by the National Bureau of Statistics, reveal a rapidly ageing, male-dominated population that continues to expand \u2013 up 5.7% since 1990 to 1.339 billion, that is considerably better educated at tertiary level than a decade ago and, for the first time in Chinese history, is on the edge of becoming predominantly urban. The census results are both a map of three decades of profound social and economic change in China, and a signpost for the future. China&apos;s planners are still grappling with the consequences of Mao Zedong&apos;s belief that the more people China had, the better: China&apos;s huge population, Mao thought, could survive a nuclear war with the USSR. Faced with an imminent further population explosion, Mao&apos;s successors imposed China&apos;s draconian one-child policy which, 30 years later, is still shaping China&apos;s social and economic choices. Clearly visible in these latest census results are the trends that informed China&apos;s 12th five-year plan, published earlier this year: first, that the day is in sight when China will run out of the cheap labour that has fuelled its growth in the past three decades; second, that the gender imbalance is worryingly large, the result of a preference for an only son over an only daughter; and third, that the burden of caring for a growing population of elderly citizens, in what is the world&apos;s most rapidly ageing population, will inevitably fall on a shrinking proportion of the economically active. The impact of a shrinking labour pool is already visible in the rising wages and labour shortages that have been affecting low-end manufacturing in China&apos;s coastal provinces, forcing factories to move nearer to the inland labour pool, or abroad. The government response is to attempt to move China up the value chain, following the example of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, but the statistics are a reminder that this is a race against time and will reawaken the worrying doubt that China might grow old before it grows rich: compared with 10 years ago, the number of people over 60 has risen by nearly three percentage points to 13.3%, while the percentage of under-14s has dropped 6.3 percentage points to just 16.6%. China must now balance the risks of relaxation of the policy \u2013 the threat of a further rapid rise in population \u2013 against the risk of stagnation. The pattern of economic development is also visible in the distribution of the population and how they live: that the size of households has fallen is attributed both to low fertility and the growth of nuclear family living. The proportion of non-Han Chinese has risen slightly, as China&apos;s so-called national minorities enjoy a more relaxed birth-control regime. And, most striking in the data released so far, China&apos;s migrant workers \u2013 the underprivileged and exploited floating population who left the land to build China&apos;s cities \u2013 has nearly doubled, up 81% to more than 261 million. The future of these migrants is another headache for Chinese planners. Migration for work does not bring the right of residence in China since the household registration system, devised half a century ago to keep China&apos;s peasants tied to the land, remains in force. While China&apos;s cities rely on migrant labour, they are unwilling to shoulder the costs of providing migrants with health, housing or welfare. As they cannot register as urban residents, migrant labourers can be expelled by force to their home towns, they have no access to medical services and their children have no right to be educated in city schools. It&apos;s a system that has exacerbated China&apos;s deep social divisions and has been increasingly questioned as the country moves towards middle income status, a target it is likely to attain by the time of the next census in 2020. By then, if things go according to plan, another 300 million people will have moved off the land and China&apos;s small farms will have been consolidated as the government attempts to feed the country&apos;s many mouths. By then, too, it has been predicted that 30 million Chinese males will not be able to find wives, with unpredictable social consequences. That may prove an even more intractable problem for China&apos;s planners."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/apr/28/2", "publicationDate": "2011-04-28T19:42:43Z", "tags": ["Science"], "sentences": ["  Mystery Bird photographed at Taipei City, Taiwan, China."], "title": "Today's mystery bird for you to identify", "article": "  Mystery Bird photographed at Taipei City, Taiwan, China.

(Remember: Microsoft told reviewers in early October 2010 that it would be &quot;shipping a compelling update very, very soon.&quot;) This suggests to me that while Microsoft&apos;s plan to require handset makers to closely follow a single hardware spec (originally two hardware specs; the second was quietly dropped with nary a public comment) was a good one, it hasn&apos;t actually panned out yet in the real world.

I was just settling into my seat when the passenger who would be sitting next to me arrived. He was flustered, and very angry. He had just been charged almost \u00a3300 for excess baggage and couldn&apos;t understand why the airport staff were being so mean. &quot;I am only a young student, I don&apos;t have that money,&quot; he pleaded. But here&apos;s the rub. The check-in staff had in fact offered him the chance to delay his return flight so that he could go home and repack, and they were willing to fly him home a day later at no extra cost, which I thought was really quite generous. I asked him why he didn&apos;t take up the offer. &quot;Where would I stay, I have checked out of my residence,&quot; he replied. &quot;What about your friends?&quot; I asked, but he just shrugged, and said: &quot;No, that&apos;s not possible, I can&apos;t stay anywhere.&quot; I was dumbstruck. The friends I made at university have been my friends for life. I couldn&apos;t understand that this young graduate had just spent three years living in London and he didn&apos;t have a single friend that he could call on to save adding \u00a3300 to his student debt. The issue here is clearly one of integration \u2013 the university that my fellow passenger had attended had completely failed him in this respect. Dominic Scott, chief executive of the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA), says the attention universities pay to integration is patchy but that the rise in student satisfaction surveys over the past two to three years is creating awareness of the issues and in many institutions additional efforts are now being made. &quot;Many recognise that it is very important that integration takes place within the first few weeks. If students haven&apos;t found other international and UK friends by then, it may well not happen for them at all during the rest of the year. The good universities put a lot of time into orientation, mentoring and volunteering programmes in the first few weeks \u2013 all of which can really help bring students (and the local community) together.&quot; Scott would most likely approve of the welcome programme run by Adrienne Clarke, director of the international office at the University of East London (UEL). When I spoke to Clarke she painted a vivid picture of two contrasting first days at university. On the one hand you have the UK student who is often brought to the university during the day by their family. The boot of the car is stuffed with home comforts, the duvet is in there, some saucepans, maybe a telly, food, drink, you name it. And then there is the international student whose flight lands late at night. They are alone, 5,000 miles from home, with just one case of clothes in a country that is much colder than where they&apos;ve come from. UEL has introduced a range of measures to ease this difference. The programme starts with pre-departure briefings, so that students can meet face to face with representatives from the university to get answers to basic questions about what they need to bring with them. &quot;They ask basic stuff like &apos;Do I need to bring a rice cooker&apos; and we say &apos;No, you can buy them here&apos;,&quot; Clarke says. The next step is their airport pickup service and five-day welcome programme, which Clarke says helps to settle the young international students. &quot;We give them duvet sets and a backpack of goodies. They love it. There is a phonecard in there because their mobiles often aren&apos;t set up to work here and some snacks.&quot; Interspersed between talks on using the library, avoiding plagiarism and using correct citation and referencing, they run trips to the local supermarket, explain the complexities of Transport for London&apos;s Oyster card, and help the students register with a doctor. &quot;We don&apos;t want them to have to miss lectures because they are off setting up bank accounts,&quot; says Clarke. And because all of these things take so long, to prevent endless queuing they divide the students into small groups and run simultaneous social activities: while one group is enrolling another is learning circus skills, or salsa. It helps break the ice. The five-day welcome programme run for the international students elides seamlessly with a three-day programme for the home students so by the end of the five days the two groups are well mixed. The campus at the University of Falmouth is much smaller, and their intake of international students far lower, so they are able to deal with the students&apos; logistical problems much more quickly and rely on the internet a lot more. UKCISA cite the university&apos;s online handbook as an example of best practice. Their International manager, Stuart Westhead says his team use a combination of their own online material and Facebook to give prospective students a full and rounded picture of student life in Cornwall. Falmouth&apos;s official website carries all the important formal information, but after that they then allow the students to do the rest of the talking. Westhead explained that they used to run their own inhouse chatroom but it was superseded by the rise in social media. &quot;We look at their Facebook page and it&apos;s so lively, they post wonderful images of their experience in Cornwall, so we let them get on with it.&quot; The Facebook page is used by alumni, prospective and current students and Westhead says allowing the students to do things their own way is best, although he advises current students to refer prospective students to the international office when important questions come up.  Alongside a range of podcasts teaching research and essay writing skills, Sheffield Hallam university has produced a podcast to guide its international students from Manchester airport to Sheffield. As well as giving them directions it tells them what to expect and how to behave. &quot;It says things like &apos;You will need to convince the immigration officer that you are a student, so get your offer letter out now&apos;,&quot; says international student support officer Andrew Bromley. Bromley organises scores of social events each year to help international students settle in, including a scheme called Local Friends, which he says is hugely popular: &quot;We&apos;ve got a database of about 50 local families who are keen to meet people from around the world. It&apos;s up to the host how they spend their time. They might meet for a coffee, or show them their favourite place in Sheffield, or invite them into their home. Sometimes the host families get involved because they have children that are learning languages, sometimes they just want the experience of meeting people from different cultures.&quot; Bromley encourages home students to organise social events for the visitors. He says students in events management and public relations have been particularly keen to get involved in the past, as well as English language students who are considering teaching English as foreign language. &quot;At Christmas international students are often alone, but last year we organised more than 20 events for them. This year we held a big Christmas Day dinner which more than 70 students attended.&quot; UKCISA&apos;s Scott makes a compelling argument as to why the work done by international student support workers like Clarke, Westhead and Bromley is so important: &quot;Increasingly those universities and colleges that invest in ensuring international students integrate well, make best use of the facilities and gather both British and other nationality friends tend to be most successful in recruiting others. These integration activities are not just nice to have, they are an essential part of differentiating between institutions. Figures and all research show that proper integration, which enables students to leave university with UK friends as well as a UK degree makes the difference between them being averagely satisfied customers to firm advocates of your institution.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

The Yushan weather station regularly records winds gusting up to force 17, the top of the scale indicating wind speeds of more than 125mph. In Yushan the wind is channelled through a rift valley to the opening of the wind gap. It is strong enough to prevent the build-up of ice or snow, leaving a treacherous gravel surface. And it is dangerous; one meteorologist was blown off the mountain to his death. The path up to the weather station now has a metal screen and chains to help climbers.

Can you identify the family that this species is placed into and, if you have seen it, can you tell me which species this is? Response: This is an adult male vinaceous rosefinch, Carpodacus vinaceus, a common seed-eating bird of dry lowland forests throughout southeast Asia. This species&apos; common name -- vinaceous -- refers to red wine, which the male&apos;s plumage colour resembles. These birds are placed into the family fringillidae, the true finches, and the genus, Carpodacus, the true rosefinches. But cytochrome b/mitochondrial DNA data indicate this large genus is in need of a thorough revision. At this time, the presumed future classification of many of the Asian rosefinches, including the vinaceous rosefinch, remains uncertain. However, when this taxonomic revision occurs, the American rosefinches -- house finch, Cassin&apos;s finch, and purple finch -- which are tentatively included in Carpodacus, will probably be removed into their own genus, Burrica.

Meanwhile, we spend about twice as much per capita on healthcare and, in a wide number of instances, our outcomes are not as good as others that spend far less. It is time that we bring about a fundamental transformation of the American healthcare system. It is time for us to end private, for-profit participation in delivering basic coverage. It is time for the United States to provide a Medicare-for-all, single payer health coverage programme. Under our dysfunctional system, 45,000 Americans a year die because they delay seeking care they cannot afford. We spent 17.6% of our GDP on healthcare in 2009, which is projected to go up to 20% by 2020, yet we still rank 26th among major, developed nations on life expectancy, and 31st on infant mortality. We must demand a better model of health coverage that emphasises preventive and primary care for every single person without regard for their ability to pay. It is certainly a step forward that the new health reform law is projected to cover 32 million additional Americans, out of the more than 50 million uninsured today. Yet projections suggest that roughly 23 million will still be without insurance in 2019, while healthcare costs will continue to skyrocket. Twenty-three million Americans still without health insurance after health reform is implemented? This is unacceptable. And that is why, this week, Representative Jim McDermott and I are announcing the re-introduction of the American Health Security Act, recognising healthcare as a human right and providing every US citizen and permanent resident with healthcare coverage and services through a state-administered, single payer programme. Let&apos;s face it: until we put patients over profits, our system will not work for ordinary Americans. It is incomprehensible that drug companies still get away with charging Americans twice as much, or more, than citizens of Canada or Europe for the exact same drugs manufactured by the exact same companies. It is an outrage that insurers still often hike premiums 20%, 40% and 60% a year on individual policy holders; and some insurers still spend 40 cents of every premium dollar on administration and profits while lavishing multimillion-dollar payouts on their CEOs. It boggles the mind that approximately 30% of every healthcare dollar spent in the United States goes to administrative costs, rather than to delivering care. We must do better. Taiwan, for example, spends only a little over 6% of GDP on healthcare, while achieving better health outcomes on some key indicators than we do; yet they spend a relative pittance on administrative costs. I am very proud that my home state of Vermont is now taking big steps to lead the nation in healthcare by moving forward on a plan to establish a single payer healthcare system that puts the interests of patients over chasing profits. The American Health Security Act would make sure every state does the same \u2013 taking profits out of the equation by implementing a single payer system, but letting each state administer its own programme, according to strict standards, in a way best suited to its needs. The goal of real healthcare reform must be high-quality, universal coverage in a cost-effective way. We must ensure, to as great a degree as possible, that the money we put into health coverage goes to the delivery of healthcare, not to paper-pushing, astronomical profits and lining CEOs&apos; pockets."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/may/13/2", "publicationDate": "2011-05-13T21:23:00Z", "tags": ["Science", "Zoology", "Birds"], "sentences": ["  Mystery Bird photographed at Taiching, Taiwan.", "[I will identify this bird for you in 48 hours] Image: Marie Louise Ng, 6 May 2011 [velociraptorize].Nikon D7000   This Taiwanese mystery bird has a very large range but local populations look different."], "title": "Today's mystery bird for you to identify | GrrlScientist", "article": "  Mystery Bird photographed at Taiching, Taiwan.

After nearly 600 pages, Kissinger fails to address the key\u00a0question: why and how did President Richard Nixon decide that it was in America&apos;s interests to protect communist China? Kissinger tells us that this de facto alliance was personally decided by Nixon in August 1969 just as the Soviet Union was preparing to launch a pre-emptive nuclear attack on China. Nixon had decided the Soviets were the more dangerous party and that it was against American interests for China to be &quot;smashed&quot; in a Chinese-Soviet war. &quot;It\u00a0was a revolutionary moment in US foreign policy,&quot; Kissinger explains. &quot;An American president declared we had a strategic interest in the survival of a major communist country.&quot; In October 1969, Mao Zedong was so convinced war was nigh, he ordered all Chinese leaders to disperse around the country, except for the indispensable Zhou Enlai. Kissinger says that it was only Moscow&apos;s uncertainty about America&apos;s response that led the Soviets to postpone the project. Soon after, Kissinger, as Nixon&apos;s national security adviser, engaged in the secret negotiations that led to the American president&apos;s meeting with Mao in 1972, an event that astonished America&apos;s enemies and its friends. Nixon&apos;s policy has guided eight American presidents and four generations of Chinese leaders. It continued after the Soviet Union, and the military threat it posed to China, had disappeared. It continued even after the outrage that followed the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. Three weeks after 4 June, the White House sent secret envoys to reassure the communist leadership that the Sino-American alliance would continue no matter what. Kissinger can truly claim to be the chief architect of what was and remains one of the pillars of the international order. He advised and directed White House China policy for four decades, and on 50-odd visits to China has consulted with every one of its leaders. That, not the large fees he pockets for appearing at one of those regular business conferences boosting economic ties, is why he always looks so pleased with himself in China. The alliance is as crucial to understanding world history as Britain and\u00a0America&apos;s decision to make an ally\u00a0of Stalin in order to defeat Hitler, rather than the other way round, the result of which was the establishment of a Soviet empire in Europe rather than a German one. Kissinger says that at the time it seemed the Soviet Union was more dangerous because, unlike China, it was an expansionary, aggressive power. Is this true? China had sent troops to Korea and Vietnam (not 100,000 as Kissinger claims, but closer to 500,000), as well as to Burma and Cambodia, and had financed and trained insurgencies in a dozen countries \u2013 which would cost millions of lives. There wasn&apos;t much to choose between them. Kissinger says he wrote the book to &quot;explain the conceptual way the Chinese think about problems of peace and war and international order&quot;. But what we really want is a justification for this policy. Even at the time it was a\u00a0bizarre move, but with the advantage of hindsight it is even more peculiar. What exactly did America ever gain from it? It certainly enabled China&apos;s rulers to stay in power despite Mao&apos;s catastrophic rule, but no evidence has\u00a0emerged that the alliance directly contributed to the Soviet Union&apos;s collapse. On the contrary, if Beijing and Moscow had gone to war, surely it would have been to America&apos;s great advantage. America might have emerged victorious from the Vietnam war and saved Cambodia from the horrors of Khmer Rouge rule. The long-standing threat to South Korea and Taiwan might have disappeared and the Soviet gains of the 1970s, such as in Angola or Afghanistan, might not have been made. One supposes that Nixon feared a swift Soviet victory in China, but Kissinger does not say that. Instead, he constantly invites us to share his pleasure at the brilliance and subtlety of Chinese leaders, no matter who they are: Zhou, Hua Guofeng, Deng Xiaoping. Even when he meets Mao \u2013 senile and dribbling \u2013 Kissinger can&apos;t help being blown away by his supposed brilliance. Yet Mao was by then recognised even by his followers as a mad monster. He had managed to make enemies of practically everyone in China, starved up to 50 million people to death, repeatedly purged the army and party, imprisoned or exiled millions, and ruined the economy. He led the country into ruinous and costly wars with every one of China&apos;s neighbours and was now willing to sacrifice tens of millions more in a nuclear war with the Chinese Communist party&apos;s great benefactor, the Soviet Union. Kissinger explains that actually this was all yet another dazzling example of Mao&apos;s skilful diplomacy, learned from studying the ancient Chinese arts of statesmanship, specifically an instance of Zhuge Liang&apos;s &quot;empty city stratagem&quot;. Mao would supposedly lure the Soviets deep into the countryside and then destroy them. In fact, Kissinger should have practised the Taoist concept of wu wei and done nothing. It was evident even then that Mao and Zhou would be dead within a few years and had prepared no succession. Kissinger recounts how the famous ping-pong diplomacy only started when Mao, slumped over the table in a drug-induced haze, suddenly woke and gave the orders to his nurse. Whoever followed Mao would have to rescue China from its total isolation and restore the economy. They would have to go cap in hand to America for help, and Washington could dictate its own terms. Instead, Nixon turned up in Beijing as a supplicant, waiting anxiously to be summoned to the emperor&apos;s side, listening to tutorials in\u00a0strategy. In return for this blessing, the Chinese persuaded the Americans to withdraw from Taiwan, and then to support China&apos;s murderous prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, the Khmer Rouge, in Cambodia, forced them to lose the war in Vietnam, to sacrifice Tibet, and of course to sacrifice America&apos;s moral principles. As Kissinger remarks of another occasion: &quot;At a moment of great national danger \u2013 which its own analysis demonstrated \u2013 China nevertheless acted as an instructor on strategy.&quot; In truth, the Chinese couldn&apos;t believe their luck in finding such a naive and biddable partner as Kissinger. He gratefully accepts whatever the Chinese leaders tell him at face value, especially their nonsensical self-serving version of Chinese history. For instance, he starts the book with Mao explaining that Tamurlaine was really a Chinese general \u2013 Tamurlaine wanted to invade China. Kissinger implies that only a clever diplomat such as himself can catch the sophistication of the Chinese people and their &quot;subtle sense of the intangible&quot;. So in this book Chinese leaders never sound unreasonable, but always sensible and pragmatic, unlike the Americans, who make unreasonable demands and have confused ideas about democracy and human rights. Kissinger has no curiosity at all: he never looks behind the curtain, let alone listens to spokesmen of the Chinese opposition. Even after Tiananmen, when the dissident physicist Fang Lizhi was holed up for 18 months in the US embassy and the subject of high-level bargaining, Kissinger didn&apos;t bother to meet him. It&apos;s a pity that Kissinger was never distracted from his mission to achieve &quot;a rebalancing of the global equilibrium&quot;. The world might have been quite a different place.

As we report elsewhere, PC Simon Harwood, an officer in the Met, will face criminal prosecution for striking Tomlinson with a baton and pushing him to the ground during the G20 protests in April 2009. The wheels of justice will turn, as they should, but they turn slowly and the process is never cheap. During this month&apos;s inquest into the death of Tomlinson \u2013 which found unlawful killing \u2013 the officer was accompanied to and from the hearing by two fellow constables and one police sergeant, also members of his unit, the Territorial Support Group (TSG). Over three days, that alone, we learn, cost the taxpayer \u00a32,300. \u2022 Still, we live, we learn. And they teach many things in the army: when to advance, when to retreat, lessons well taught to Patrick Mercer, the Tory MP for Newark, and 25 years a soldier. As he spoke at the House of Commons on Monday, all of his strategic skills were on display. Addressing a meeting organised by the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, and a dozen members of both houses, Mercer told them that all the men under his command had loved every minute of it; he&apos;d never heard an unhappy word from any of them. You&apos;re &quot;talking bollocks&quot;, cried a member of the invited audience. This turned out to be the author of The Skinback Fusiliers, a no-holds-barred expos\u00e9. He told Mercer in no uncertain terms that life at Catterick Garrison was very far from happy, a view reinforced by another speaker, Lynn Farr, who set up &quot;Daniel&apos;s Trust&quot; after her son died at Catterick in suspicious circumstances. Points both critics were keen to raise with the Tory action man. But pretty quickly, he was gone. \u2022 And following the sudden disappearance of Bahrain&apos;s ruler, King Hamad al-Khalifa, from the list of attendees at last month&apos;s royal wedding, the issue of the brutal suppression of popular protest in Bahrain looms again for the Queen \u2013 in the shape of a horse. Not just any horse. The Queen&apos;s three-year-old Carlton House is hot favourite for the Derby at Epsom on 4 June. The colt, as a yearling, was a gift from Sheikh Mohammed, who is the ruler of Dubai, its defence minister and vice-president of the United Arab Emirates. The UAE has sent 500 troops plus armoured vehicles to Bahrain where they were welcomed by al-Khalifa, who said they would be used to &quot;secure stability&quot; in the kingdom. The UAE has also sent troops and police to Saudi Arabia to help &quot;guard government buildings&quot;. If Carlton House, trained in Newmarket by Sir Michael Stoute, wins a fortnight on Saturday it would be the first royal winner of the Derby in 102 years. No wonder the Windsors are excited. Principles are principles, it is true. But then, a gift&apos;s a gift. \u2022 Shock in Brussels where Ukip MEPs are coming to terms with the defection of David Campbell Bannerman to the Conservatives. No warning from him, apparently; just crowing from the Tories. But we should have known, dejected Ukipians say. The defection deal was apparently struck a month ago over steaks with the enemy in Piccadilly. But just last week Campbell Bannerman joined five Tories on a jolly to Taiwan. That&apos;s strange, the Ukipians said, we don&apos;t take junkets; what&apos;s he up to. So\u00a0the signs were there. Still hurts. \u2022 Finally, Buckingham Palace was the place to be yesterday, but, slowly, the masses are gathering in London&apos;s Mayfair. They gather for the Hef. Not Simon Heffer, unfortunately. No, Hugh Hefner who is flying over from Los Angeles for tomorrow&apos;s launch of a new Playboy Club. So many look forward to greeting him with their slogan &quot;Eff Off, Hef!&quot;. The new club is opening 30 years after the closure of its predecessor establishment, which was also based in Mayfair. It was targeted by a police raid and then by the licensing authorities. No such risk this time, for everything will be above board, and in any event our police long ago got bored of raiding nightclubs. So save for the protest, everything is set fair. With cheers and leers, Hef, now 85, can proceed in his own grubby way."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/may/26/zoology-birds", "publicationDate": "2011-05-26T15:00:01Z", "tags": ["Science", "Zoology", "Birds"], "sentences": ["  Mystery Bird photographed at Taichung City, Taiwan, the Republic of China.", "This lovely Taiwanese mystery bird lives on the sides of mountains and engages in a migration that is not triggered by season -- what triggers its movements and where does it go?"], "title": "Today's mystery bird for you to identify | GrrlScientist", "article": "  Mystery Bird photographed at Taichung City, Taiwan, the Republic of China.

Ulasen works in the research and development department of a small company called VirusBlokAda in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, which has been giving advice about computer security since 1997. &quot;These computers were constantly turning off and restarting,&quot; Ulasen told the Guardian. &quot;It was very strange. At first we thought maybe it was just a problem with the hardware. But when they said that several computers were affected, not just one, we understood that it was a problem with the software the computers were running.&quot; Ulasen was given remote access to one of the malfunctioning machines, but he soon realised he needed help. He roped in a colleague, Oleg Kupreyev, the firm&apos;s senior analyst, and they spent a week unravelling samples of the computer virus they had &quot;captured&quot; which was affecting the Iranian machines. The longer they looked, the more they realised they had uncovered an extraordinary piece of engineering, unlike anything either of them had come across before. Ulasen published his findings on a few online message boards and gave the virus a name, TmpHider. Months later, a clearer picture emerged. Ulasen, 28, was unaware that the computers that had gone on the blink were among those being used by Iranian scientists involved in efforts to enrich uranium as part of the country&apos;s nuclear programme. The malware that had disrupted their work turned out to be so fiendishly clever that Iran accused the US and Israel of developing it. And the virus itself had been given a new name: Stuxnet, which may go down in history as the cyber-weapon that changed the face of modern warfare. The story of Stuxnet is complicated, not least because the false trails laid by those trying to conceal conventional espionage become nearly impossible to follow when they are in the virtual world of computer codes and software design. But specialists from GCHQ, the Ministry of Defence, and independent analysts agree on this: Stuxnet was ingeniously complex, probably took several people many years to develop, and has opened the eyes of every government to the destructive possibilities of a new type of covert attack. Though there is no conclusive proof, and there may never be, the circumstantial evidence about its origins suggests that Iran was probably right. Very few countries had the motive, the money or the capability to create Stuxnet. This virus was not a blunt instrument. It was designed to disable specific control systems running 9,000 Iranian centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium, causing some of them to spin out of control. It also covered its tracks by fooling operators into believing that the equipment was working as usual. Infecting these computers was a work of mind-boggling enterprise. According to Symantec, one of the world&apos;s leading security firms, the operation to introduce the virus into the Iranian network would have involved old-school theft and an unwitting insider at the Iranian facility, as well as daring and skill. To start with, its creators needed to know exactly the sort of computer configuration that the Iranians were using to run the centrifuges at their underground uranium-enrichment plant at Natanz. They found this out by stealing the blueprints they needed, using, of course, a virus. Traces of an early version of Stuxnet have been found that show the virus went on a reconnaissance mission in mid-2009, infiltrating the network, scanning the systems and recording what it found. This would have given the developers the layout they needed; it showed Iran was using certain types of program logic controllers to run the centrifuges \u2013 PLCs are used in all sorts of businesses and industries to help machines run automatically. To test the updated virus that would cause the sabotage, its creators must have built a mirror image of the Iranian facility, computers and all, allowing them to practise and refine their targeting. Because PLCs are so common, they programmed Stuxnet to ignore any PLC that was running a machine at slow speed; it needed to hunt down the PLCs that were running motors at high speed, because they were more likely to be controlling the centrifuges. The New York Times reported earlier this year that this testing phase might have taken place at Israel&apos;s Dimona complex, in the Negev desert. Wherever it happened, this task alone would have taken 10 developers at least six months, Symantec estimates. But even then, the job was barely half done. The new Stuxnet still had to be introduced back into the Iranian network without raising alarm. So they hid the virus in a driver file built into a standard Microsoft Windows program being used by the Iranians. In normal circumstances, the Windows software would automatically raise the alarm that a new, potentially unauthorised file had been installed as soon as a computer was switched on. But Stuxnet&apos;s authors got round this. They stole two genuine digital certificates from companies in Taiwan, and used the details on them to fool the Windows program into thinking the new files had been properly authorised. Even then, Stuxnet had to be downloaded at Natanz, a massive and well-protected nuclear site in the middle of the desert near Kashan in central Iran. In all likelihood, a contractor working at the site, probably using a laptop on which the Windows program was installed, plugged into the system to conduct routine work. Who that was and exactly when it happened, nobody knows. Unknown flaws Once connected, Stuxnet was designed to proliferate aggressively. And it went unnoticed for so long because it was able to exploit four previously unknown flaws in the Windows program. To find one flaw \u2013 or &quot;zero-day&quot; vulnerability \u2013 in a programme is regarded as rare. To find four would have required a monumental research effort. Over several months, Stuxnet surreptitiously tracked down the right PLCs and started to vary the speeds of the motors spinning the centrifuges, making some of them go wildly out of control. Analysts who unravelled Stuxnet noted that the virus bookmarked what it was doing, using the figure 19790509. That could be a random number. Or it could be a nod to 9 May 1979 \u2013 the date a Jewish-Iranian businessman called Habib Elghanian was executed in Iran. He was accused of spying for Israel. A 67-page Symantec report concludes: &quot;The real world implications of Stuxnet are beyond any threat we have seen in the past. Stuxnet is the type of threat we hope to never see again.&quot; There are conflicting reports about how many centrifuges were affected, and how much damage was done, and the Iranians have understandably tried to play down its impact. Don&apos;t be fooled, warns Ilias Chantzos, a Symantec director. He believes that Stuxnet is forcing governments to re-evaluate &quot;the way we understand threats to critical infrastructure and national security&quot;. &quot;It is the first virus that was designed to achieve a kinetic effect. It was not designed to steal data or to deny access. It was designed to manipulate an industrial control system to operate outside its intended instructions. Someone had the intent to weaponise a virus. Before Stuxnet the possibility to attack [a control system] using cyber was explored theoretically but was more seen as in the realm of cinema and creative science-fiction-thriller writing. Now it is a real-life scenario.&quot; Claire Yorke, an expert in cyber-security at the thinktank Chatham House, says: &quot;Although the origin of the virus is still unknown, its sophistication and complexity suggests it would have required significant time and resources beyond the capability of non-state actors. The virus used several secretive &apos;back doors&apos; into the Iranian computer networks and would likely have taken months to have been developed and tested to a level at which it could achieve the intended results.&quot; She adds: &quot;While viruses such as Stuxnet are a rare occurrence and sit at the leading edge of the technical spectrum, they could be seen as evidence of future modes of attack.&quot; The UK&apos;s response to such threats, and to the broader and much more prosaic issues of security online, was set out in last year&apos;s strategic defence and security review, which gave \u00a3650m to beef up the country&apos;s cyber-defences. The coalition made cyber-security a tier one priority \u2013 the highest \u2013 and a new infrastructure across government is being created to tackle a problem that has been growing, and mutating, for more than 20 years. The Cabinet Office has traditionally taken the lead on this, with Neil Thompson, one of the country&apos;s leading intelligence specialists, now heading the over-arching Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance. This includes the Cyber Security Operations Centre, based at GCHQ, which already has about 30 staff, drawn from different government departments. One measure of the importance now attached to this work is that Thompson&apos;s colleagues say he is in almost daily contact with Howard Schmidt, the US&apos;s cyber-security co-ordinator, who was appointed by Barack Obama after the president declared that cyber was a strategic priority for the White House. The difficulty for GCHQ, and for all the other agencies with an interest in the subject, is that the spectrum of potential threats is very broad, and state-on-state attacks \u2013 while potentially devastating \u2013 probably account for only a fraction of it. Cyber-security includes the activities of fraudsters, other criminals and, to a far lesser extent, terrorists, who all all operate online and attempt to use cyber-tools to steal information or disrupt everyday services. Most of what GCHQ sees involves systematic efforts to break through or sneak round the firewalls put around the computer systems run by government departments, banks and big business. Iain Lobban, the director of GCHQ, said that more than 20,000 malicious emails were found on government networks each month, and 1,000 of them were specifically targeted. In a rare public speech last autumn, Lobban also conceded that some computer worms have successfully burrowed their way in and caused &quot;significant disruption&quot;. &quot;Cyberspace is contested every day, every hour, every minute, every second,&quot; he said. &quot;I can vouch for that from the displays in our own operations centre of minute-by-minute cyber-attempts to penetrate systems around the world.&quot; GCHQ estimates that 80% of these kinds of attacks can be dealt with by better computer &quot;hygiene&quot;: more care being taken with passwords, for instance. Five hundred people in the organisation&apos;s Cheltenham HQ are involved in giving advice to Whitehall and industry about the threats and how best to counter them. Obsession Anxiety about valuable data being stolen without anyone noticing is shared across all sectors. It is an obsession for banks and corporate giants in the City of London, who would argue that the theft of intellectual property is a much more pressing concern for the UK economy than a Stuxnet-style raid on one of Britain&apos;s nuclear plants. The Cabinet Office agrees, which is why Lobban has been trying to encourage a more holistic approach to cyber-security, encouraging firms to share information about the threats they have identified. Once-niche security firms that struggled to make ends meet in the 1990s now find themselves feted and providing advice to the UK&apos;s top companies. They also have hundreds more analysts than the government, and databases at least as rich as any owned by the state. Symantec, for instance, can monitor one-third of the world&apos;s entire email traffic every minute of the day from hubs it has set up around the globe. But while the cyber-security industry in the UK blossoms, GCHQ&apos;s real value is in looking at the 20% of threats that cannot be dealt with by ordinary means \u2013 seeking out those that might threaten the national infrastructure by, say, crippling energy companies, or the communications systems run by the emergency services. Some Whitehall officials have drawn solace from Stuxnet, saying that the analysis of the virus &quot;has shown how difficult it is to do this stuff&quot;. But they also recognise that the cyber-domain is particularly attractive to some states because of the low bar for entry. State-sponsored cyber-activity is growing, and will continue to do so, said one official, because it is still a comparatively cheap means of warfare compared with buying warships and fighter jets. &quot;You don&apos;t need much money, and you don&apos;t need many people,&quot; said the official. &quot;You could put two students in a room, give them computers and let them have a go.&quot; At the very top end of such capability are targeted weapons such as Stuxnet. But there are other, cruder methods for causing mass disruption. So called &quot;denial of service&quot; attacks have become quite common, though not on the scale that crippled parts of Estonia in 2007 at the height of a diplomatic row with Russia. During that episode, the country&apos;s main computer systems were bombarded with requests for information by other computers which had been ordered to do so after being infected with malicious software \u2013 malware. The network of &quot;bad&quot; computers (&quot;botnet&quot;) that launched the attack came from all over the world, including the US, Brazil and Canada. The attack crippled Estonia&apos;s parliament, banks and main businesses for up to a fortnight. Russia was assumed to have been behind it. National Security Experts have long thought that the UK would be, and probably should be, working up its own range of cyber-weapons, and last year the government hinted this was now a priority. The strategic defence and security review said: &quot;Over the last decade the threat to national security and prosperity from cyber attacks has increased exponentially \u2026 We will also work to develop, test and validate the use of cyber capabilities as a potentially more effective and affordable way of achieving our national security objectives.&quot; Now ministers have openly acknowledged the need to develop new offensive weapons, new questions need to be answered - and not just those about the protocols and legal basis for using them. One senior defence official noted that traditional arms manufacturers had &quot;smelt the money&quot; and were now diversifying to include cyber-capabilities, recasting the military-industrial complex. Three years ago, Britain&apos;s biggest arms manufacturer, BAE Systems, bought Detica, an established and well-respected technology firm. Earlier this year, the firm worked with the Cabinet Office to publish a cost of cybercrime report \u2013 but some independent experts, such as Professor Peter Sommer, who lectures at the LSE, regarded Detica&apos;s involvement in an independent report as a mistake. He said the Cabinet Office had to show it had &quot;the independence to repel the lobbyists&quot; if it was to retain its credibility. There was another key issue. &quot;One of the things the major software companies don&apos;t want us to discuss is the huge number of flaws in their software. The flaws provide countless opportunities for criminals and other attackers and they exist because the software houses are more interested in revenue from selling us new gimmicks in their products than testing them so that they are solidly safe to use.&quot; Much better to spend much more money on &quot;the basics of looking after your computer, the way you use it and how sensibly to assess cyber-related risks,&quot; Sommer said. &quot;That&apos;s why I want to see significant government funding going to organisations such as GetSafeOnline rather than on exotic experimental kit from the big international armaments companies.&quot; In truth, officials acknowledge that the UK will need to both spend at the low end, and at the high end, to keep ahead on cyber-security. &quot;Cyber is not for geeks any more,&quot; said one official. &quot;It&apos;s for everyone. The threats are here and now.&quot; Glossary Malware A Malicious software program is designed to damage or do other unwanted actions on a computer system. Common examples of malware include viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. All of them work in a slightly different way. A virus, for instance, needs to attach itself to an existing piece of software, but a worm can work independently of it. Botnet A botnet is a group of computers controlled from a single source which run related software programs and scripts. The term usually refers to multiple computers that have been infected with malicious software. To create a malicious botnet, a hacker must first compromise several computers. Hacker While this term originally referred to a clever or expert programmer, it is now more commonly used to refer to someone who can gain unauthorised access to other computers. A hacker can &quot;hack&quot; his or her way through the security levels of a computer system or network. Zero-day vulnerability A zero-day attack or threat is one that exploits a hitherto unknown flaw in a computer programme. Developers are supposed to test their software rigorously before they go on sale, but flaws are still found once they are in use. Companies then send out patches to repair the flaws.

We asked HTC...", "article": "Who&apos;s making money out of Android? Some carriers (because people are buying smartphones), perhaps some handset makers, one or two app developers, and possibly Google through ancillary services such as search and maps. Oh, and Microsoft. Very much Microsoft. That&apos;s right: according to a briefing note from Walter Pritchard, an analyst at Citi, Microsoft is getting $5 per Android handset sold by HTC following a patent settlement over intellectual property infringement in April 2010 relating to Android. And continuing lawsuits by Microsoft against other handset makers are reportedly seeking between $7.50 and $12.50 per device sold using Android as well. That could turn into a profitable sideline for Microsoft, since Android has the biggest share of the smartphone market. In fact Horace Dediu of Asymco calculated that based on 30m HTC Android devices shipped, at $5 each to Microsoft, that&apos;s $150m for Microsoft. Compare that to 2m Windows Phone licences at an estimated $15 per phone, that&apos;s around $30m. (I think the figure is slightly higher now - 2.3m to the end of the first quarter - but it doesn&apos;t shift the figure much.) That&apos;s five times as much income from Android than from Windows Phone. If Microsoft can get the same sort of settlement from other Android handset makers, then the mobile phone business could turn into a good profit centre for it - because it gets this levy without having to do any work, not even software development. And that money is also available to be funnelled to Nokia, which is going to install Windows Phone. So HTC is helping out Nokia. Now, I think it&apos;s important when we see stories like this to check them with the sources. So I put in a call to HTC to ask whether it agreed with the $5 estimate put forward by Pritchard. First reaction: &quot;oh, that sounds far too high. I don&apos;t think we&apos;d be paying that.&quot; A few hours later, I got the official statement. Are you ready for it? Here it comes. &quot;Last year, HTC and Microsoft did announce a licensing agreement for Android handsets. Such agreements are not unusual in the wireless industry, and as is the case with all such agreements, HTC does not disclose financial terms.&quot; HTC is in all likelihood completely banned from discussing the amounts of the settlement, because to do so would affect Microsoft&apos;s potential to win higher amounts in any future patent licensing agreements it wins from other handset makers. It&apos;s tempting to think that HTC hasn&apos;t confirmed the $5 figure because it&apos;s correct - but it could still be two or three times too high.  Yet even in that case, that still means that Microsoft has received far more money from Android licensing than from its own phones, so far.  Update: Matt Brian of TheNextWeb points us to an interesting report from Taiwan which suggests that the fee being paid is already around the $5 mark and that Microsoft wants to up it to that $7.50-$12.50 mark:   HTC confirmed yesterday (May 29) the increase of the licensing fee but refused to specify the amount.   And:   Jung Chueh-sheng, chief financial officer of HTC, noted that it&apos;s common for hi-tech firms to pay licensing fees, adding the company&apos;s gross margin stayed at the satisfactory level of 29-30% in the recent four quarters. He discounted the influence of the increased licensing fee, which will be offset by continuing expansion of the company&apos;s sales.  This merits a little bit of unpacking. Saying that the gross margin stayed at a particular level in the past doesn&apos;t mean anything, since this is talking about an increase in fees in the future. But he&apos;s clearly hopeful that lowered costs from selling more handsets will make up for the extra payments. If anyone knows quite how many more handsets you have to sell to offset that sort of extra cost, do pitch in.  So Microsoft is definitely going to do better, for now, from Android than from Windows Phone. (HTC, it should be noted, also makes Windows Phone 7 devices. So Microsoft wins both ways from it.) Don&apos;t expect that to change much between now and October, when we expect the first Nokia &quot;Nokindows&quot; phone. And with HTC&apos;s success continuing, it might even become a large enough number to show up in HTC&apos;s accounts. We&apos;ll keep a look out. And in the meantime we&apos;ll savour the irony."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/31/intel-ultrabook-mobile-sean-maloney", "publicationDate": "2011-05-31T08:56:07Z", "tags": ["Intel", "Technology", "Computing", "Tablet computers", "Smartphones", "Technology sector", "Business"], "sentences": ["In an exclusive interview before his keynote speech at the Computex exhibition in Taiwan, Intel&apos;s executive vice-president Sean Maloney explained how the company was changing to compete with mobile chips based on rival ARM designs."], "title": "Intel's Ultrabook signals first steps into mobile", "article": "Faced with one of the biggest challenges in its 43-year history, Intel is accelerating its efforts to produce chips for the mobile phones, tablets, netbooks and ultra-thin laptops. In an exclusive interview before his keynote speech at the Computex exhibition in Taiwan, Intel&apos;s executive vice-president Sean Maloney explained how the company was changing to compete with mobile chips based on rival ARM designs. While Intel has dominated the market for the processors used in personal computers, ARM-based chips are used in almost all smartphones and most of today&apos;s tablets, including Apple&apos;s popular iPhone and iPad. ARM is now moving up to compete for Intel&apos;s customers, and during ARM&apos;s press conference at Computex, Tudor Brown, president of the UK-based company, said: &quot;By 2015, we expect that to be over 50% of the mobile PC market.&quot; However, Intel is still trying to invade ARM&apos;s territory by producing faster chips that use less power, which are needed for smaller devices. In his keynote, Maloney touted an &quot;emerging new breed&quot; of ultra-thin portable PCs for which Intel has trademarked the term Ultrabook, with one of the first examples being the Asus UX21. So how will Ultrabooks differ from current models such as Apple&apos;s MacBook Air and Samsung Series 9? &quot;We&apos;re lowering the price,&quot; Maloney says, &quot;not so much immediately, but over time.&quot; Part of the Ultrabook concept is getting really thin, really responsive systems down into the mainstream, he says. When they cost $1,000 or more, they&apos;re relegated to 10% of the notebook market. &quot;If we do it right, the PC Ultrabook will be 40% of the notebook market in about 18 months,&quot; says Maloney. &quot;We did this before in 2008 and we screwed it up: we didn&apos;t cut the price. Now, we&apos;ll cut the price, thanks to volume and scale.&quot; Maloney is referring an earlier effort based on battery-friendly ultra low voltage chips, for which Intel has traditionally charged a premium. Making ULV chips in high volumes is a big change from the factory standpoint and from the design standpoint. &quot;Sandy Bridge [the codename for the Core iX design launched in January] is the first step in reinventing the PC,&quot; Maloney explains. &quot;The second step is Ivy Bridge, which is built on our industry-leading 22-nanometer process. The third step is Haswell in 2013. We will double the battery life.&quot; All the major chip manufacturers invest heavily to produce chips with smaller transistors, measured in nanometers (nm). Ivy Bridge will also be the first high-volume processor to use &quot;a revolutionary 3D transistor design called Tri-Gate&quot;, which Intel announced in May. Intel believes its global network of advanced chip factories, or fabs, gives it a significant advantage over ARM, which doesn&apos;t make chips, but supplies designs to licensees such as TI and Qualcomm. In fact, Intel also used to offer ARM-based processors with its StrongARM and XScale ranges, but it sold that business and developed its own Windows-compatible (or &quot;Intel architecture&quot;) Atom range instead. The Atom was successful in powering the market for low-cost netbooks running Microsoft Windows XP. However, netbook sales have slumped about 40%, according to Microsoft, as tablets have become more fashionable. In response, Intel has come up with a new Atom platform code-named Cedar Trail, which will enable thinner, fanless netbooks, and Medfield, which Maloney describes as &quot;Intel&apos;s first purpose-built 32nm platform for smartphones and tablets&quot;. Intel&apos;s previous &quot;system on a chip&quot; (SoC), Moorestown, wasn&apos;t used in any mobile phones, but Maloney is more optimistic about Medfield, which will appear in the first quarter of next year. &quot;It&apos;s optimised for tablets and phones running Google&apos;s Android [operating system] initially, so we&apos;ll see.&quot; Medfield offers higher performance with lower power consumption, and Maloney says it will enable PC manufactures to build tablets that are less than 9mm thick and weigh less than 1.5 pounds. Medfield could also be used for tablets running the next version of Windows, which will also run on ARM chips. I ask Maloney about the prospects for Windows 8 tablets. &quot;I think on Intel [architecture] they&apos;ll grow very quickly,&quot; he says. &quot;Windows 8 is the next generation, and we&apos;ll be able to do Windows 7 and below on Windows 8. And that&apos;s good.&quot; Maloney says that Intel plans to advance Atom chip manufacturing twice as rapidly as expected, moving it from 32nm through 22nm to 14nm within three years. Each shrinkage enables the manufacturer to include more features while reducing power consumption and thus extending battery life. Because more chips can be made from each silicon wafer, it should also reduce the price per chip. For comparison, the A5 and A5 ARM-based processors used in the iPhone 4 and iPad 2 are still manufactured by Samsung using a 45nm process. &quot;ARM has almost 100% of the tablet market, but really that&apos;s one company: Apple. We&apos;re just moving into the tablet market. Medfield is cutting the power consumption dramatically, so we&apos;ll see what happens. The ARM ecosystem is very good, but it&apos;s a marathon, not a sprint.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/02/chinese-school-implicated-cyber-attacks", "publicationDate": "2011-06-02T12:59:00Z", "tags": ["Hacking", "Google", "China", "Computing", "Technology", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["At an earlier stage of the investigation the attacks appeared to have originated in Taiwan, an ally of the US, but that has since been narrowed down."], "title": "Gmail hack: phishing finger pointed at China's Lanxiang vocational school", "article": "Depending on your perspective, Lanxiang vocational school is either the heart of a secretive global hacking conspiracy or a second-rate educational factory that is best known for churning out hairdressers and cooks. Founded in 1984, the school takes in 20,000 students a year and has a domestic reputation for its kitchen and boutique training. But it also has a large computer studies class. The school&apos;s catalogue boasts 10 huge, high-standard laboratories equipped with 2,000 Founder brand PCs. At one point Lanxiang said it held a Guinness world record for the room with the most computers. The school gained notoriety in 2010 when the New York Times named it as one of two schools suspected of involvement in hacking attacks on American companies and human rights activists. The report, which cited anonymous sources close to the investigation, suggested the strikes were linked to a specific class taught at Lanxiang by a Ukrainian professor. It traced the attacks to the IP address of one of the school&apos;s computers. The school has repeatedly denied any involvement in computer hacking or a special relationship with the military, but it is back in the spotlight after Google said that a high-level phishing assault against overseas military targets and domestic human rights activists originated in the school&apos;s hometown of Jinan, the provincial capital of Shandong. Though the US search engine did not name the school, it has inevitably drawn attention because of last year&apos;s New York Times report. The paper described Lanxiang as a huge vocational school established with military support that trains computer scientists for the People&apos;s Liberation Army. The report says the school&apos;s computer network is operated by a company with close ties to Baidu, the dominant search engine in China and a competitor of Google. China&apos;s state media poured scorn on the reports, saying they exaggerate the influence of a technical college for students who cannot make it into university. Xinhua, China&apos;s official press agency, noted with unusual irony that the hacking allegations were the best advertisement the second-rate institution had ever had. Claiming to cite several Chinese bloggers, it said: &quot;Many laughed at the suggestion that a simple vocational school, which mainly offers courses like cooking, auto repair, hairdressing and basic computer skills classes, had the capacity to stage the cyber attacks.&quot; The English version of the Global Times, a Chinese newspaper known for its nationalist editorial stance, said the school had seen a surge of applicants since the US suspicions were made public. Contacted by the Guardian, the school rejected the latest accusations. &quot;We have nothing to do with this event,&quot; said a woman at the school office who declined to give her name. &quot;How can we have such high technology or such elite students? It&apos;s impossible.&quot; The allegations have raised as many questions as they answer. Without a clear trace back to the People&apos;s Liberation Army, analysts have speculated that the school&apos;s computers could as easily have been used as camouflage by the authorities as by a third party \u2013 either patriotic rogue hackers or even a third country. Unless the school opens up its computers to scrutiny this will be hard to determine. At an earlier stage of the investigation the attacks appeared to have originated in Taiwan, an ally of the US, but that has since been narrowed down. Jinan is likely to remain a focus of investigations into global hacking activity."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/06/top-10-audioboo-moments", "publicationDate": "2011-06-06T06:00:14Z", "tags": ["Mark Rock", "Digital media", "Media", "Audioboo", "Apps", "Internet", "Technology", "QI"], "sentences": ["Political rally in Taiwan \u2013 7 November 2010"], "title": "Top 10 most-listened-to Audioboos", "article": "1.

For the unlucky foetus conceived with two X chromosomes to parents who would rather have no child at all than have the burden of a girl, making it through a full-term pregnancy is no guarantee of a life to come. A research paper by Nancy Qian of Yale found that for every 100 females aborted in Taiwan after the procedure was legalised, 10 additional girl infants survived. Because parents could select for sex before birth, they were less likely to select for sex after birth \u2013 that is, less likely to kill their unwanted girl children, either by neglecting them or simply murdering them. That means that sex-selective abortion makes a considerable and alarming contribution to the number of &quot;missing women&quot; out there \u2013 the women who statistically ought to exist, and yet never somehow come into being. But the uptick in infant survival for girls tells us that, where termination isn&apos;t an option, parents find other means to act on their preference for boys. As grotesque as this femicide is, and whatever one believes about the rights of the foetus, it&apos;s a terrible trade-off to make: baldly, how many murdered girls would you tolerate to see an increase in the number of female live births? It&apos;s a strikingly unpleasant dilemma. And if we decide that actually, yes, we do think some infanticide is a better outcome than many abortions, and declare sex-selective terminations unsupportable, another ugly moral expanse opens up. Because now we&apos;re talking about preventing women from exercising choice about their own bodies and their own fertility. Preventing it with the best feminist motives of wanting to save female lives, sure \u2013 but preventing it all the same. The systematic elimination of girl children is a terrible wrong, but taking away the rights of adult women seems like a backwards way of protecting females. Sex-selection stories in the UK (when there isn&apos;t a urgent medical motive, like a hereditary sex-specific disease) tend to hinge on a parent&apos;s burning desire to have a child they can either kick a football at or cover in pink frills \u2013 reasoning that makes gender into a frivolous add-on in the quest to assemble a perfect family. But in the parts of the world that practise widespread sex-selective abortion, having a baby with the &quot;wrong&quot; genitals can be devastating. In Half the Sky, Nicholas D Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn recount the stories of women in south-east Asia beaten and abandoned by their husbands for giving birth to girls. Anthropologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy cites northern Indian dowry traditions as one reason for the stigma against females. When having a baby girl means inviting physical danger or financial ruin, it&apos;s hard to simply condemn women for opting to terminate. It&apos;s worth remembering, too, that if the stakes are high enough, it doesn&apos;t matter whether abortion is legal or not \u2013 desperate women will attempt to end an unwanted pregnancy by any means, and abortions are inevitably more dangerous when they&apos;re illegal. Another terrible trade-off: how many adult women are we willing to have die of botched procedures in order to get a few more of those missing girl children into an inhospitable world? Ultimately, though, this shouldn&apos;t be seen as a medical dilemma, but as a social one. The way to prevent sex-selective abortion isn&apos;t to legislate against it or attack the women who seek it \u2013 it&apos;s to create cultural changes that transform the place of women. By offering girls education, training and opportunities for employment, femicidal traditions can be uprooted, and a world that values women and fully recognises their right to exist created instead. To get there, though, we must first accept that women have the right to make decisions about their own bodies, on their own terms. Because if no one gives them autonomy in their own skin, why should they believe that their potential daughters deserve it either?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/07/ford-automotive-industry", "publicationDate": "2011-06-07T20:23:28Z", "tags": ["Ford", "Automotive industry", "Business", "Volkswagen (VW)", "General Motors", "Toyota"], "sentences": ["Demand also soared in Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey."], "title": "Ford looks east in plans to be global leader", "article": "The US carmaker Ford is aiming to drive up sales by 50% by 2015 as it hopes to take advantage of fast-growing demand in the developing world. Underlining the importance of emerging markets to western companies, the chief executive, Alan Mulally, unveiled plans on Tuesday to increase the company&apos;s worldwide sales to 8m vehicles a year from 5.3m by the middle of the decade. The increase would shoot the Detroit-based company to the top of world production. Last year, the global leader, Toyota, sold about 8.42m vehicles. Ford announced that sales in China rose 14% last month amid strong demand for its mid-range cars. It wants more than one-third of its sales to come from the Asia-Pacific region and Africa by 2020 \u2013 twice what it sells in those regions today. In 2010, Ford sold 838,000 cars and trucks in the Asia Pacific region, which includes China, India, Australia, South Africa and Japan among its 12 markets. It controlled 2.4 percent of that region&apos;s sales. Ford&apos;s plans follow news this week that the German carmaker Daimler sold more of its Mercedes-Benz cars in May than in any month in its history. The company delivered 108,766 Mercedes vehicles in emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China. Sales on Daimler&apos;s home turf slipped marginally and in the US, the firm&apos;s second largest market, sales grew only by 1.8%. But sales in China and Hong Kong rose by 43% to a new record high for the month of May. New records were also achieved for the month in India and Russia, which saw sales rise 39.8% and 49.2%, respectively. Demand also soared in Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey. The increase in sales at Daimler and Ford came despite some recent signs of slowing sales in the Chinese auto market amid expiring government sales incentives. The slowdown has held back sales at rivals Toyota and General Motors (GM). Ford&apos;s close competitors GM, Toyota and Volkswagen have larger shares and better brand recognition in Asia. But auto analysts said the firm was well positioned to take advantage as its rivals, many of which have stalled for various reasons in the recent past. Bill Visnic, analyst at Edmunds.com, said Ford, along with South Korea&apos;s Hyundai and Kia, were gaining at the expense of Toyota, which has been rocked by a series of recalls and by the recent earthquake in Japan. But he said Ford was also benefiting from its emergence after the recent meltdown of the US car industry. Ford was the only major US car firm not to declare bankruptcy or to take government cash following the credit crisis. Visnic said Ford was not alone in hoping to take advantage of the Japanese car firms&apos; woes or GM&apos;s fall. &quot;Volkswagen is aiming to double its US sales. It wants to be the number one carmaker by 2018.&quot; Volkswagen recently said it intended to sell more than 10m cars by 2018 and overtake Toyota and GM to become the world&apos;s largest auto firm in terms of sales. Ford, the second-largest US carmaker, still makes most of its sales and profits in the US and Europe. It has a 2.4% share of the market in China, the world&apos;s largest car market, against GM, which has 10%, according to marketing research firm JD \u00a0Power. Visnic said Ford had redesigned its products to give them a more &quot;European profile&quot; with smaller, fuel-efficient cars. &quot;Energy prices will continue to plateau at higher and higher levels and Ford seems to have grasped where it needs to be for the next five years,&quot; he said.

The vessel in question is a defunct Soviet-era carrier formerly named the Varyag that was bought in 1998 from Ukraine by a Hong Kong company on the pretext that it would be used as a floating casino off the shores of Macau. Instead it has been upgraded at China&apos;s Dalian naval shipyard with combat sensors and defensive weapons and painted in the colours of the People&apos;s Liberation Army. For several years foreigners have been kept out of the area of Dalian where the work has taken place. But the existence of a 67,500 tonne vessel is not easily concealed and in recent months photographs have appeared in state-run media. Chen Bingde, the chief of China&apos;s military general staff, has gone a step further in an interview published in the Hong Kong Commercial Daily (translated link), saying the 300m long carrier &quot;is being built but has not been completed&quot;. His assistant chief, Qi Jianguo, suggested the vessel was both a status symbol and a long-overdue strengthening of China&apos;s naval defence. &quot;All of the great nations in the world own aircraft carriers \u2013 they are symbols of a great nation,&quot; Qi was quoted as saying. &quot;It would have been better for us if we acted sooner in understanding the oceans and mapping out our blue-water capabilities earlier.&quot; Referring to areas where territorial waters are disputed, he said that China faced &quot;heavy pressure&quot; in the South China Sea, East China Sea, Yellow Sea and the Taiwan Straits. But the carrier would never sail into the waters of other nations. No further details have emerged, leaving military experts to speculate whether the revamped hulk will indeed mark a significant projection of Chinese military power as a &quot;blue water&quot; force or the revamped hulk will hold only symbolic value, lacking the technology and operational experience to challenge the US navy. The commander of US Pacific forces, Admiral Robert Willard, told the Senate in April that he was not concerned about the carrier&apos;s military impact but expected it would make a big impression on public opinion. &quot;I think the change in perception by the region will be significant,&quot; he said. In the past year the Chinese military has surprised many foreign observers with the speed of its weapons development \u2013 notably the test flight of a J-20 stealth fighter and a &quot;carrier-killer&quot; missile. China has yet to announce whether the carrier will be renamed. One report suggests it will be called Shi Lang, after a Qing dynasty admiral who conquered Taiwan \u2013 further fuelling unease about its impact on regional stability. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 June 2011.

The stability and predictability of Israel&apos;s neighbours, he says, has been replaced by instability and unpredictability. &quot;For similar reasons, but with an opposite conclusion, the Palestinian leadership find it hard to go into negotiation with an Israeli partner they don&apos;t trust, to make difficult compromises which will be tough to sell, in circumstances where they don&apos;t know the regional context into which such compromises will be played.&quot; Blair also warns more broadly that the world has not yet adjusted to the emergence of China as a global economic giant, saying &quot;engagement with geopolitics of the 21st-century will be unlike anything the modern world has seen.

The former premier did a round of interviews on Thursday morning in which he made clear his support for military action in Libya, which he said seemed to be &quot;succeeding&quot;. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: &quot;My view is that it is preferable to act, because the implications of things going wrong in this region are so strong.&quot; He added: &quot;I think that the construct of what the west and allies \u2013 including Arab countries \u2013 are doing is right. We have got to judge that according to the circumstances, but I think at the moment it looks like it is succeeding.&quot; The fate of Egypt would be crucial to the outcome of the Arab spring, he said. He said it would not be easy but &quot;on balance&quot; he was optimistic. He insisted he had been right to make overtures to the Gaddafi regime when prime minister. &quot;I think we were right to welcome what he did then and we&apos;re right to condemn and go after him for what he&apos;s doing now,&quot; he told the BBC. &quot;I think when he gave up his nuclear and his chemical weapons programmes, this was a huge thing for us. He stopped sponsoring terrorism, he started actually co-operating. It was a big change and, frankly, had the internal policies been the same, had he gone through the same process of change that his foreign policy went through, it would have been beneficial for him.&quot; On Syria, Blair said the west had to consider the consequences for the region of bringing down a regime such as that of Bashar al-Assad&apos;s. &quot;It&apos;s not always easy to make absolutely logical distinctions. I mean, why are we treating Syria differently than Libya? The answer is because there isn&apos;t the same consent to deal with the Assad regime in Syria. &quot;There is some hope still, I think diminishing, that he could offer a reform programme of change in Syria, and most of all, and this is what&apos;s difficult when you&apos;re sitting in a position of leadership \u2013 if you remove that regime, what follows? What do you get? Do you get an orderly transition to democracy or do you get chaos, instability, with massive ramifications, in this case, for Israel, Palestine, for the peace process there.&quot; While praising European and US efforts in Libya in his new foreword, Blair also calls for an elected European president who would have a mandate for far-reaching reforms including collaborating on taxes.

At first, I&apos;m not sure why she&apos;s picked it. There are hundreds of bikes in front of us, and at this distance the black one she&apos;s chosen seems a bit boring. Then we wander over and I realise we&apos;re looking at something special. It&apos;s got the frame of a road bike, the handlebars of a trick bike and the forks of a mountain bike. The back wheel is 28in in diameter, the front only 26in. If Frankenstein&apos;s monster were a bicycle, he might look like this. Custom-built bikes are the latest trend in urban cycling. I&apos;m at Brick Lane Bicycles (BLB), a hub for bike-building in east London, and the shop is crammed with adapted two-wheelers. In recent years the craze has been for riding fixed-gear bicycles; now people want to build their own, or pay others, such as BLB, to make one for them. &quot;Almost everyone is doing it,&quot; says David Kitchen, who runs the London Fixed-gear and Single-speed bike forum, an online gathering point for passionate cyclists. &quot;Everyone&quot; may be an exaggeration \u2013 this is still a niche interest \u2013 but it certainly includes novice cyclists. &quot;We get a lot of people on the forum wanting to jump on the tail-end of the fixed-gear craze, wanting to know where to start,&quot; says Kitchen. &quot;And unbelievably they start with trying to build a bike themselves.&quot; It&apos;s hard to describe the trend in numbers: there aren&apos;t any nationwide industry sales figures. But most of the cyclists, bike-builders, and shop-owners I talk to agree that it is not restricted to east London hipsters. Bristol will hold the country&apos;s first bespoke bicycle fair this weekend. Bryan Jackson, who runs a bike-building course from his Canterbury shop, Downland Bicycles, says he has to turn would-be students away. At Brixton Bicycles in south London, sales of bike-making tools have doubled since 2006. Meanwhile, BLB&apos;s profits have trebled in the past three years, despite several rival bike-builders opening in the area. Quite what defines a custom-built bike is a moot point. For Ed Tucker, a cameraman who built his first bicycle three years ago when he was living in Bristol, it meant gathering parts and mostly &quot;cobbling it together out of old bits I found at scrap bike stores and on websites&quot;. A friend gave him a white Raleigh frame from the 80s, he bought wheels off eBay, and a chain set and saddle from a Bristol shop called Jake&apos;s Bikes. The front tyre came from a website, the back from another shop. It took a few months, but the whole thing cost less than \u00a3200 \u2013 about a third of what a similar bike would have cost ready-made. For the author and cyclist Robert Penn, a handmade bike means something a bit different. In his book, It&apos;s All About The Bike, Penn describes how he built his own personalised steed. Like Tucker, he plucked parts from all over, including north America and Europe. But, crucially, Penn doesn&apos;t buy a frame secondhand: he has it built from scratch by artisan frame-maker Brian Rourke. It&apos;s a lengthy and meticulous process \u2013 the frame has to suit both Penn&apos;s body and his style of riding exactly. Before any work begins, Rourke tinkers with Penn&apos;s existing bike, and accompanies him on a long ride to assess his needs.     A custom-built single-speed bike. Photograph: David Levene    True aficionados also draw a line between handmade frames made by the likes of Rourke and those made by people known as boutique designers. &quot;Someone making you a handmade frame will chat with you about what you want, gather lots of tubing, and make your perfect bike from scratch,&quot; says Phil Taylor, organiser of Bristol&apos;s inaugural UK Handmade and Boutique Bicycle Show. By contrast, he explains, &quot;a boutique producer designs a frame, and then might send it off to Taiwan to be built in small batches. You&apos;ll buy a complete bicycle from them, but it won&apos;t be made to your specific requirements.&quot; Either way, all the methods are increasingly popular. Rob Prentice, a bike-mad art history student from London, recently started assembling bikes in his flat for anyone who wants one. Orders are piling in. By the end of this month, he&apos;ll have put together 15 bicycles with secondhand frames. In July, he&apos;ll do 20 more. &quot;I reckon we&apos;re coming up to a golden summer of bike-building,&quot; he says. &quot;Having worked in bike shops over the past few years, it was usually just couriers coming in, or people who took their bikes to the velodrome. Now everyone&apos;s interested.&quot; In Southampton, bespoke frame-maker Tom Warmerdam also reports an upsurge in demand. In 2009, the year he set up his firm, Demon Frameworks, Warmerdam made a dozen frames. In 2010, he made between 15 and 20. This year, he thinks he might top 30. Warmerdam is one of what Taylor calls &quot;a new young blood of British frame-building&quot;, and he&apos;ll exhibit his work at Taylor&apos;s show this weekend, alongside roughly 35 other frame-builders (almost the entire British frame-building class). Taylor hopes their combined presence will attract 3,000-4,000 bike fans. So why and how did all this happen? Cost is one answer. &quot;It can be done extremely cheaply,&quot; says Kitchen. &quot;At the budget end, cobbling things together from broken parts, it&apos;s possible to build a really high-quality bike for around \u00a3250. Most people might think that is a lot of money to spend on a bicycle. But if you&apos;re spending less than \u00a3300 in a shop, you won&apos;t get a great bike. Whereas if you get the parts off FreeCycle, Gumtree or eBay, you will.&quot; Even people buying a bespoke frame are, relatively speaking, getting a better deal. &quot;If you want to replace your quite nice but battered old road bike,&quot; Penn tells me, &quot;you might have to pay \u00a32,500 to replace it with something on the same level. But if you go to a frame-builder and get a bespoke frame made to measure, it might only be about \u00a3750.&quot; The internet has also played a big part, Penn adds. &quot;You can be sitting at home, thinking, &apos;I&apos;ve got this type of stem, I wonder what bar it would fit.&apos; And you could Google it and have your question answered in no time.&quot; Bike parts are also much easier to track down, thanks to eBay and Wiggle. &quot;I&apos;ve a neighbour who goes around buying bike parts from jumble sales all over the country. But the internet&apos;s obviated the need for those.&quot; Greater investment in cycling also helped: the introduction of schemes such as Cycle to Work, the creation of more cycle routes, and the formation of 17 &quot;cycle towns&quot; such as Derby and Blackpool, which saw a 27% rise in cycle use. And as cycling became more popular, people became more interested in how their bikes worked. In London, where cycling has risen by 117% in the past decade, Prentice thinks the emergence of Boris bikes, a public cycle-sharing scheme, has also played a part. &quot;We&apos;re riding the Boris bike wave,&quot; he says. &quot;Everyone&apos;s tried one, cracked their fear of London cycling, but noticed those bikes don&apos;t perform that well. So the roll-on effect is that they now want to build their own.&quot; Some customers want a high-performance machine that will make their commute as fast as possible. &quot;But there are people who just want the most beautiful thing you can make,&quot; he explains. They are in effect paying around \u00a3200 for the parts and about \u00a340 for the labour, for a fashion accessory. It was entirely apt then that the song Being a Dickhead&apos;s Cool, a viral send-up of the Shoreditch hipster, included the line: &quot;Just one gear on my fixie-bike.&quot; Negative connotations aside, though, the fixie has a significant place in the bike-building story. Ten years ago, Kitchen explains, fixies &quot;only existed as track bikes in velodromes. They weren&apos;t used on the street, and the only place in the world where you could buy them in bulk was Japan.&quot; So an increasing number of people started building them themselves \u2013 and a craze was born. It was a reaction, Kitchen argues, against a homogenised bike industry. There are very few large British bike manufacturers left, and many of the brands sold here \u2013 Trek, Scott and Colnago, for instance \u2013 are built offshore by a single Taiwanese firm: Giant. Companies such as Giant appeal to a mass market and are reluctant, Kitchen feels, to experiment with new designs. Ian Beasant, Giant UK&apos;s managing director, disagrees. &quot;I think there&apos;s a huge choice of off-the-peg products. We have an expansive range, especially in the lifestyle and commuter section. And if you look at the mountain bike segment, we&apos;re all trying to drive that.&quot; Ironically, though, it&apos;s mountain bikers who are starting to embrace the handbuilt model, according to Warmerdam. People are taking traditional mountain bikes, giving them bigger wheels, smoother tyres &quot;and running them as urban bikes&quot;. Now that the big firms have started mass-producing fixies, amateurs have had to find new ways to give their bikes personality. And perhaps it&apos;s this opportunity for self-expression that best explains why unique, handbuilt bikes are so popular. &quot;It&apos;s about imagining a bike that has not previously existed,&quot; says Kitchen. The process is practical, too: you learn how a bicycle works. &quot;It&apos;s like Meccano,&quot; Tucker explains. &quot;You experiment with what fits what. Sometimes that&apos;s quite frustrating, because you buy something that&apos;s not compatible with something else. But you end up with something very charming. You&apos;re riding something you&apos;ve put together.&quot; Barny Stutter, co-owner of Brixton Cycles, puts it best. &quot;What else is left like this in the modern world?&quot; he asks. &quot;You can&apos;t really build your own computer. You can&apos;t build your own car. But you can build your own bike.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 10 June 2011.

Last week, the sequel to the\u00a0Chinese-themed, US-made animation broke box-office records in China, taking 125m yuan (\u00a311m) in its opening weekend. It&apos;s great news for its creators at DreamWorks, mildly irritating news for Chinese animators and intriguing news for the rest of the cinemagoing world, coming just as a newly confident China squares up to the original moviemaking superpower. In Hollywood, movies that borrow far-eastern exoticism to entertain western audiences are as old as Mann&apos;s Chinese Theatre \u2013 and usually as authentically Chinese. Kung fu movies have been popular in the west since the 70s, and Hong Kong cinema gained its own\u00a0foothold when director John Woo exported his\u00a0signature &quot;gun fu&quot; to Hollywood with The Killer in 1989, following in person four years later What is new, however, is the tempting prospect of more than a billion Avatar-appreciating movie fans in mainland China. Already the world&apos;s second largest economy, China is set to overtake Japan and become the second largest cinema market after the US. According to the predictions of the China Film Producers&apos; Association, by 2015 China will have built more than 7,000 new cinemas, and have annual box-office receipts of up to \u00a33.7bn \u2013 which would explain Hollywood&apos;s increasingly unsubtle efforts to woo Chinese audiences. Last year&apos;s remake of The Karate Kid replaced Japanese karate with Chinese kung fu and a California setting for a Beijing location shoot. Seth Rogen&apos;s version of The Green Hornet passed over more obvious casting choices\u00a0for the role of the sidekick Kato in\u00a0favour of Jay Chou, who was little-known in the west, but a bankable heartthrob in the far east. Like a suitor spurned, in 2007 the US also lodged a complaint with the World Trade Organisation over China&apos;s protectionist film distribution practices. This March&apos;s decision in the US&apos;s favour prompted speculation over whether China\u00a0would relax the strict quota system for the release of foreign films. And if it\u00a0did, how would that affect local film-makers? It seems the Chinese film industry has responded by remembering a favourite teaching of ancient military philosopher Sun Tzu: attack is the best form of defence. This month, Legend of a Rabbit will open in China, the first release from a 4.5bn yuan (\u00a3420m) animation facility developed by the Chinese state as \u2013 at least\u00a0in part \u2013 a response to the success of the first Kung Fu Panda film. As a challenger to the big Hollywood studios, it will join Hengdian World Studios in Zhejiang province, which since the mid-1990s has steadily grown to become the world&apos;s largest outdoor film studio. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Hero (2002) and the American martial arts film The Forbidden Kingdom (2008) all made use of the complex&apos;s historical sets, which include a full-scale replica of the Forbidden City. To call it &quot;Chinawood&quot; would seem a tad reductive. Why is the Chinese government investing so generously in cinema? As Hollywood&apos;s international reach proves, a healthy film industry extending a nation&apos;s cultural reach can be as useful to a nascent\u00a0superpower as any number of nuclear warheads. Or, from a perspective less tinged with cold war nostalgia, China&apos;s\u00a0economic prosperity affords it the opportunity to present its own image to the world, unmediated by Hollywood. Not that it will be easy. &quot;The western perceptions of China as an ageless rural country with a repressive &apos;red&apos; regime remain a difficult obstacle for Chinese filmmakers \u2013 other than by designing these fantastic tales of martial arts set in ancient China,&quot; says Yingjin Zhang, author of A\u00a0Companion to Chinese Cinema. Raymond Zhou, a film critic and columnist for the China Daily newspaper, agrees that\u00a0using\u00a0cinema to introduce the real China to the rest of the\u00a0world may present some difficulties. &quot;Traditional Chinese values are mainly non-confrontational and do not make good movies,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;ll take a genius\u00a0to tell a quintessential Chinese story on screen and be successful all over\u00a0the world.&quot; Could that genius be Zhang Yimou? A member of the first generation of directors to graduate from the reopened Beijing Film Academy following the Cultural Revolution, he is the most internationally successful director to emerge from mainland China, and along with Ang Lee, from Taiwan, among the most important Chinese-language directors working today. His 2002 film Hero opened at No 1 in the US box office, making it the second-highest grossing foreign-language film in\u00a0US history (after Mel Gibson&apos;s The Passion of the Christ) while his 2004 followup House of Flying Daggers grossed a healthy $93m (\u00a356m) worldwide. Yet even a director of Zhang&apos;s standing has found that foreign interest dwindles when he strays too far from the martial arts (wuxia) formula. A Woman, a Gun and\u00a0a Noodle Shop, Zhang&apos;s Gansu province-set remake of the Coen Brothers&apos; 1984 film Blood Simple, made only a miniscule proportion of Hero&apos;s $53m (\u00a332m) box office and went straight to DVD\u00a0in this country. Zhang chalks this up to cultural differences. &quot;It&apos;s black humour and I think that has many local facets, like\u00a0the language, the way they talk, the gestures and so on. So it&apos;s normal that people [in the US] don&apos;t get much of it. It didn&apos;t really bother me.&quot; Expectations are much higher for Zhang&apos;s latest film, The Heroes of Nanking,\u00a0which is scheduled to wrap this\u00a0week. A big-budget historical drama about the 1937 massacre of Chinese citizens by Japanese troops, it is no wuxia spectacular, but it does benefit from the presence of a western star in Christian Bale. Fresh from his Oscar win for The Fighter, Bale plays an American priest who\u00a0helps hundreds of civilians escape death. The Dark Knight is yet to open in China (Warner Bros cited &quot;cultural sensitivities&quot;), but Bale has a following among young Chinese thanks to the country&apos;s vigorous trade in pirate DVDs, which have long been a key way for Chinese viewers to see foreign films. Zhang says The Heroes of Nanking was made with international audiences in mind. &quot;First of all, the story is very international. It has a universal message about humanitarianism, about love and redemption, and also we have Christian Bale. And the other thing is almost half of it is in English.&quot; But the real strength of the film, says its Hollywood-based executive producer David Linde \u2013 who also worked on Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon \u2013 is that while its story is quintessentially Chinese, it has an appeal\u00a0that transcends national borders. &quot;A great signature director working with an incredibly inspiring actor? That in and of itself is thrilling. When do you get an opportunity where different cultures truly\u00a0connect, in story, performance and direction? Really, very rarely.&quot; It might seem unrealistic to expect US appetites for foreign film to broaden as fast as the Chinese appetite is growing, but Linde, who has worked with directors including Ang Lee, Pedro Almod\u00f3var and Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, says there&apos;s hope. &quot;There&apos;s clearly a real fascination with China. I don&apos;t know about\u00a0England, but, as one small example, one of the things you&apos;re seeing a lot here is students increasingly studying Mandarin, instead of the more traditional French and Italian.&quot;\u00a0And now that nervous\u00a0jokes about a Mandarin-speaking\u00a0future have become a mainstay of American political comedy, might curiosity about the new\u00a0paymaster translate into box-office\u00a0receipts? &quot;I think that the opportunity for Chinese film-makers here\u00a0is pretty significant.&quot; What matters for Chinese film-makers, Zhang says, is not whether they will be able to reach foreign audiences, but whether they&apos;ll be able to satisfy their own. &quot;The market is growing very fast\u00a0and\u00a0well-known directors don&apos;t necessarily develop at the same pace. We\u00a0have an old Chinese saying: &apos;It takes 10\u00a0years to grow a tree, but 100 years to\u00a0make a man.&apos; Maybe this will break the\u00a0limitation on internationally imported\u00a0films, so we can\u00a0have films from\u00a0all over the world to fulfil the people&apos;s\u00a0need.&quot; That, of course, is where Hollywood steps in. When The Heroes of Nanking opens in the US, it will likely be accompanied by the rustle of both popcorn\u00a0boxes and Hollywood screenwriters riffling through Chinese history books, on the hunt for suitable western characters. It can&apos;t be long before Reese Witherspoon is trading Mandarin quips with Tony Leung in her latest romantic comedy and James Cameron is directing Chow Yun Fat in a sci-fi blockbuster. When that happens, we&apos;ll know exactly which cuddly panda was responsible. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 June 2011. In the original, Zhang Yimou was referred to throughout as Yimou.

Experts say the stand-off between China and Vietnam - two of the six powers laying claim to a number of islands and their surrounding waters in the South China Sea - is the worst for more than two decades. Vietnam held live-fire exercises off its coast on Monday, in what analysts said was a response without precedent. The complex dispute over sovereignty in the 1.2m square miles of sea has been simmering for decades, but has grown increasingly fractious in the past few years. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan also lay claim to parts of the sea. As much as a third of the world&apos;s trade passes through the Malacca Strait. Countries are also competing to tap the sea&apos;s energy resources and exploit its fish stocks. Last year, foreign ministers lined up to attack China&apos;s stance at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) regional forum, in what the Chinese regarded as a Washington-led ambush. The US said it had a national security interest in a peaceful resolution and that it supported a collective solution. Beijing insists the issue should be handled through bilateral deals. &quot;In a sense [the dispute] has become more complicated because it has become conflated with Sino-US competition in south-east Asia,&quot; said Dr Ian Storey, of the Institute of South East Asian Studies in Singapore. Benigno Aquino, president of the Philippines \u2013 which has also accused China of intruding into its waters \u2013 told a press conference on Tuesday: &quot;Perhaps the presence of our treaty partner, which is the United States of America, ensures that all of us will have freedom of navigation, will conform to international law.&quot; Washington has played down the issue this year, with both sides seeking to improve relations after 2010&apos;s bilateral tensions. China&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, told a news conference: &quot;We hope countries not related to the disputes over the South China Sea will respect the efforts of directly related countries to resolve the issue through direct negotiations.&quot; In an apparent reference to Vietnam, he added: &quot;Some country took unilateral actions to impair China&apos;s sovereignty and maritime rights and interests [and] released groundless and irresponsible remarks with the attempt to expand and complicate the dispute over the South China Sea.&quot; Hong added that China would not use force to resolve disputes. Vietnam alleges that Chinese boats cut a cable from a seismic survey boat off its coast in late May and impeded another last week, while China accuses Vietnam of illegally entering its waters. Storey warned in a paper two years ago that rivalries were escalating again after easing in the first half of the last decade. &quot;Failure to address rising tensions could lead to greater regional instability, disruptions to global trade and economic development, environmental degradation and, worst-case scenario, military confrontation,&quot; he and his co-author concluded. Storey said that China saw itself as the aggrieved party, but added: &quot;Despite the rhetoric about its peaceful rise and not seeking hegemony, it is seen that China is becoming more assertive and, in the last few months, aggressive.&quot; Vietnam had reacted with unprecedented stridency by holding the live-fire drill and issuing a decree on the terms of military service, he added. &quot;The increasing frequency of incidents at sea raises the risk of an armed confrontation,&quot; said Storey, adding that tensions were at their highest point since a clash in 1988 in which around 70 Vietnamese personnel were killed. The growing strength of China&apos;s navy has also contributed to the concerns of regional powers. It is due to hold naval drills in the western Pacific and official media outlets have suggested it may launch its first aircraft carrier within months, a year earlier than expected. The renewed tensions come after a Chinese diplomatic charm offensive apparently aimed at undoing the damage from last year&apos;s row. Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt of the International Crisis Group said: &quot;[China has] seven central government agencies, the People&apos;s Liberation Army Navy, provincial governments and state-owned enterprises who all have their own interests and claims in the disputed waters. Without very solid inter-agency co-ordination, the multitude of players often make case-by-case policy decisions on the ground in accordance with their individual priorities. &quot;Some of the harder-line actors can justify their actions with the voices of strident nationalism, contributing to a heated domestic environment and marginalising more moderate voices.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/15/zara-expands-global-store-network", "publicationDate": "2011-06-15T16:07:00Z", "tags": ["Retail industry", "Business", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Zara"], "sentences": ["The Spanish owner of Zara has announced plans to expand to South Africa, Taiwan and Peru."], "title": "Zara presses ahead with global expansion", "article": "The Spanish owner of Zara has announced plans to expand to South Africa, Taiwan and Peru. Inditex, the world&apos;s largest fashion chain, opened 12 stores a week in the three months to the end of April and said it planned to open hundreds more as it strove to bring its &quot;fast fashion&quot; clothes to the world. The company, which started with a single store in La Coru\u00f1a, Spain, in 1975, now operates 5,154 shops in 78 countries and has made its founder, Amancio Ortega, Spain&apos;s richest man. Ortega, who started working as a delivery boy for a high-class dressmaker when he was 13, is now the world&apos;s seventh-richest man with a $31bn (\u00a319bn) fortune, according to Forbes magazine. Inditex opened its second Zara store in Australia, announced plans for a new Zara website in the US and said it would open 120 stores in China. The expansion plans came as Inditex defied the gloom afflicting other clothing retailers to report an 11% increase in first-quarter sales to \u20ac2.96bn (\u00a32.67bn). Inditex, which owns the Massimo Dutti, Pull &amp; Bear, Bershka and Stradivarius brands, said profits rose by 10% to \u20ac332m. The company was given a boost by photos of Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, wearing a \u00a349.95 blue polyester Zara dress the day after her wedding to Prince William. Analysts said Inditex outperformed its rivals because most of its clothes are still made in Spain and north Africa rather than China, where rising labour costs are punishing other high street fashion chains including Hennes &amp; Mauritz (H&amp;M), which reported disappointing results on Wednesday. H&amp;M, the world&apos;s second-biggest clothing retailer, said like-for-like sales had increased by 2%, compared with analysts&apos; forecasts of 5%. The Swedish company said sales in the three months to May came in at 27.6bn Swedish kronor (\u00a32.7bn), below forecasts of 28.4bn kronor. Rebecca McClellan, an analyst at Santander, said Inditex&apos;s results were good, but H&amp;M&apos;s figures were &quot;a bit more worrying&quot;. H&amp;M added 235 stores to bring its total to 2,297 over the year to the end of May. Anne Critchlow, an analyst at SG Securities, said the good spring weather had put a damper on last month&apos;s sales. &quot;If people bought summer clothes already in April when it was very hot [in key European markets], they aren&apos;t going to buy them in May again,&quot; she said. Inditex, which was slow to recognise the importance of the internet and only launched Zara online eight months ago, said it would create websites for its other six brands in September."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/17/sex-selection-rise-generation-xy", "publicationDate": "2011-06-17T17:45:18Z", "tags": ["Population", "China", "India", "World news", "Books", "United Nations", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Already, the relative shortage of women in countries like China and Taiwan has helped create new markets in women."], "title": "Sex selection and the rise of Generation XY", "article": "In 1979 China signed a $50m four-year deal with a UN body designed to help it control its spiralling population through family planning. It was the largest foreign aid package Beijing had accepted in almost 20 years. But the funds became entwined in China&apos;s one-child policy that was just taking hold, and instead of sponsoring an education drive for small families, the money was used to pay for posters in Chinese villages proclaiming &quot;You can abort it! But you cannot give birth to it.&quot; The story of the complicity of the UNFPA, the UN&apos;s main population agency, in the tyranny of China&apos;s forced abortion policy is just one of the examples given in a book that explores western involvement in what has become a modern scourge: sex selection. Unnatural Selection by Mara Hvistendahl charts how the trend towards choosing boys over girls, largely through sex-selective abortions, is rapidly spreading across the developing world. While the natural sex ratio at birth is 105 boys born for every 100 girls, in India the figure has risen to 112 boys and in China 121. The Chinese city of Lianyungang recorded an astonishing 163 boys per 100 girls in 2007. The bias towards boys has been estimated to have caused the &quot;disappearance&quot; of 160 million women and girls in Asia alone over the past few decades. The pattern has now spilled over to Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia, the Balkans and Albania, where the sex ratio is 115/100. The unnatural skewing towards male populations has become so pronounced in recent decades that Hvistendahl, a writer for Science magazine, says it has given rise to a new &quot;Generation XY&quot;. She raises the possibility that with so many surplus men \u2013 up to a fifth of men will be single in northwestern India by 2020 \u2013 large parts of the world could become like America&apos;s wild west, with excess testosterone leading to raised levels of crime and violence. &quot;Historically, societies in which men substantially outnumber women are not nice places to live,&quot; Hvistendahl writes. Already, the relative shortage of women in countries like China and Taiwan has helped create new markets in women. They include arranged wedding agencies that set up marriages between South Korean men and foreigners, often women from poorer nearby countries like Vietnam, that now account for 11% of all marriages in South Korea. There is also a booming trade in trafficking of women for prostitution out of Vietnam and a growing practice of child marriage in China, where wealthier families secure wives for their sons early by effectively buying young girls for their sons. Much of the literature on sex selection has suggested that cultural patterns explain the phenomenon. But Hvisten dahl lays the blame squarely on western governments and businesses that have exported technology and pro-abortion practices without considering the consequences. Amniocentesis and ultrasound scans have had largely positive applications in the west, where they have been used to detect foetal abnormalities. But exported to Asia and eastern Europe they have been intricately linked to an explosion of sex selection and a mushrooming of female abortions. Hvistendahl claims western governments actively promoted abortion and sex selection in the developing world, encouraging the liberalisation of abortion laws and subsidising sales of ultrasounds as a form of population control [see footnote]. &quot;It took millions of dollars in funding from US organisations for sex determination and abortion to catch on in the developing world,&quot; she writes. Even now, when the pattern of sex selection has been well documented and the prospect exists of the developing world accommodating tens of millions more men than women, the UNFPA is refusing to face up to its mistakes and confront the problem, she says. &quot;The effects of the major UN agency tasked with population advocacy distancing itself from the issue of sex selective abortion are immense,&quot; she writes, noting that the agency&apos;s foot-dragging has discouraged other global funds from engaging with the crisis. \u2022 This footnote was appended on 22 July 2011.

He lives in Essex I thought I had cystitis so I went to the doctor and asked for antibiotics. It went away for three weeks and then came back, so the doctor decided to do a blood test. That afternoon there was a knock at my door. It was my doctor telling me I had prostate cancer and that I needed to go to the hospital. I wanted to hit someone when I was first diagnosed. I was really, really angry. That hasn&apos;t gone away \u2013 I just know how to control it now. The slightest twinge and I wonder if that&apos;s it, if I&apos;m dying right there and then. The doctors said I have a really aggressive type of cancer. They&apos;ve said, &quot;It&apos;ll kill you. You&apos;re going to die from it.&quot; I was given a maximum of five years \u2013 and I&apos;m now in my fifth year. Telling my friends was straightforward. I&apos;m not ashamed of it because it&apos;s not my fault. I&apos;ve got no family, so my friends are the only people I have had to tell. If I&apos;m having a good day I&apos;ll go to the bike club to see them. I&apos;ve been a\u00a0biker since my late teens \u2013 bike rallies, camping weekends. It&apos;s a big part of my life. My friends try to keep it light and breezy. They say things like: &quot;Don&apos;t die yet, we&apos;re coming over for a coffee.&quot; The second I found out I had cancer I gave up drinking. I don&apos;t think I have any quality of life any more \u2013 well, it&apos;s not the type of life I\u00a0want to lead. My life was extraordinary before; it was very different to the norm. Now it&apos;s all about &quot;being careful&quot;. I take six tablets every morning. They make me feel sick and they&apos;ve bloated me out. I only had a short burst of chemo. It&apos;s unpleasant \u2013 your mouth and tongue split, your taste buds go \u2013 I couldn&apos;t taste the difference between a jam sandwich and a pork pie. The doctors told me that it wasn&apos;t working so there was no point in having any more \u2013 there was &quot;nothing more they could do for me&quot;. That sentence still goes round and round in my head. Mick, my brother-in-law, is the only family I have. He was married to my foster sister. He&apos;s my carer and a real support. Once a week I visit the Fair Havens Hospice in Essex. It&apos;s where I\u00a0can release the pressure valve \u2013 talk to nurses and discuss any problems. It&apos;s lovely to know that there is somewhere I can go when it all gets too much. The worst is at night when I am in bed. Lying there on my own I start thinking about funerals and I get the horrors. I&apos;ll be sitting watching telly and suddenly remember that I&apos;m dying. There are moments where my brain swirls and I think of things I&apos;ve done and people I&apos;ve hurt in the past. It&apos;s a suffocating feeling, all jumbled thoughts \u2013 it&apos;s 60 years of memories at once. I&apos;ve found a cure though: I just get in the bath. That&apos;s the only thing that relaxes me now. I worked all my life and retired at 60, then I\u00a0get told at 61 that I have a few years left and that I&apos;m going to die. I&apos;m pissed off. I wouldn&apos;t want anybody to upset me,, five years of hate would all go into that one person \u2013 that&apos;s part of the reason I don&apos;t drink. Losing my independence really gets to me. I worked in demolition all my life and all of a sudden I can&apos;t even paint a wall. I want to die at home. I have signed a contract saying that no one can take me out of my house and that Mick has the final decision to bring me to the hospice to die if it all gets too much. My funeral is sorted. Margaret, the vicar at the hospice, will be conducting it. She knows me and it feels right. She&apos;s not just going to be saying what someone else has told her to say. In a funny way, I&apos;ve always believed in God. I don&apos;t go to church or anything, but my mum taught me that God is everywhere \u2013 he&apos;s even in my house. I&apos;ve put together a CD of the music I&apos;d like played. It starts with the Biker&apos;s Prayer, followed by &quot;I&apos;m Not Alone&quot; by Boney M and then I&apos;d like to go out to &quot;YMCA&quot; by the Village People \u2013 that&apos;s an in-joke between me and my mates. It&apos;ll be the biggest biker funeral in a long time \u2013 I&apos;m friends with loads of other clubs. I\u00a0imagine there will be one hearse for me and the rest will be bikes. I&apos;d like them to remember me and celebrate my life, too. If I had one wish it&apos;d be to see next Christmas. It would be nice to have more time. I don&apos;t feel ready to go. I&apos;ve been in bands and on the telly. I&apos;ve built my bikes. It&apos;s not fair that I have to go so soon. I value life too much. I&apos;ve lived enough for two lives, but I&apos;d like a third. Holly Webber, 25, has cancer and lives with her boyfriend and family. She hopes to live for another 20 months I was 19 and at Brighton University when it started. I had a lot of stomach pain and was constantly bloated and constipated. I had symptoms for four years and saw six different GPs while I was at uni \u2013 all of them said I had irritable bowel syndrome. By the time I graduated in 2009, the pain was worse. I remember saying to my dad one morning that something wasn&apos;t right \u2013 I&apos;d been up all night passing blood. He said that he&apos;d do whatever I wanted to get somebody to take it seriously. I re-registered with our family GP who referred me to a\u00a0private specialist in order to speed things up. He sent me for a\u00a0colonoscopy. I&apos;d never been in hospital before and didn&apos;t know what to expect but I was relieved afterwards because it felt like things were finally happening. The specialist asked me to come back the next day. I spent that evening panicking, but it never crossed my mind it would be cancer. He said he&apos;d found a large growth in my bowel, which had formed from a &quot;polyp&quot;. There was never a mention of me having the C-word then, but to ensure that the growth and polyps in my bowel didn&apos;t become cancerous in the future (which I was told was likely), my specialist suggested surgery to remove my entire colon. It took me a week to stop crying because I\u00a0was so scared. The specialist suggested a\u00a0CT scan to make sure everything was in order for surgery and this scan revealed growths on my liver. I was referred to a liver specialist who carried out an MRI scan and said: &quot;I think we need to try some chemotherapy,&quot; which was enough for me to understand what was happening to me. It was cancer and it had spread from bowel to liver. In the first week of July 2010, I had another CT scan which showed all the lesions on the liver and bowel had shrunk considerably. I\u00a0was so relieved. Everything had been worth it. I&apos;d had 25 growths on my liver in all. Following the success of chemo, the surgeons performed a liver resection and removed 70% of my liver. Three months later I had my entire colon removed. The care I received during these difficult months was incredible. But I was told at the beginning of this year that the cancer had returned to my liver and spread to both my lungs. Statistically, I should have another 16-20 months if I have more chemo, which I&apos;ll start soon. This next round will make me lose my hair, so it just feels like another huge mountain to climb and something else in my physical appearance that&apos;s going to get knocked. I have scarring all over my body and an ileostomy bag attached to my stomach that I change every day \u2013 that in itself takes a lot of mental strength. I spend so long carefully choosing clothes to cover things up. I have a lot of support \u2013 an amazing family, loads of friends and my boyfriend, who lives with me and my family. My local hospice, the Phyllis Tuckwell Hospice, has been great. One of my best friends, who is based in Taiwan, quit her job to come and live with us for a couple of months to support me. I&apos;ve gained a perspective on life that is a gift in all its rawness. I&apos;m really quite grateful for that even though the circumstances are awful. I&apos;ve tried to launch myself into helping others. If I can make people see things about life in a different light, then that&apos;s really quite special. In the past, I never had faith, but this illness has made me more spiritual. I feel much more connected. Everything is just more beautiful to me now, it&apos;s much more valuable. I&apos;ve always been passionate about the environment and nature; now I feel that more than ever. What&apos;s cruel about this illness is that I&apos;ve been given a time limit. Life is so precious and we all believe we&apos;re invincible, but I know what&apos;s happening to my body. Somebody asked me recently how I cope with despair, and the only answer that I could come up with is that what keeps me going is the hope that everything will somehow be OK. I&apos;ve been told I have a terminal illness, and I get that, but if I\u00a0didn&apos;t wake up every morning hopeful, then I wouldn&apos;t get out of bed, get dressed, eat or breathe. What&apos;s anyone without hope? Sometimes I feel like I&apos;m on another planet looking in on this one. I can&apos;t relate to people stressing about work or getting the Tube. People are so wound up, but it&apos;s such a waste of time and energy. Chill out! I hope that by reading this, someone out there will take a second to think, &quot;I&apos;m glad that&apos;s not me. Maybe I\u00a0should worry less about the things that don&apos;t really matter.&quot; Help the Hospices is the charity for hospice care, representing and supporting local hospices. For more information, go to helpthehospices.org.uk Peter White, 57, has Multiple System Atrophy, a neurological disorder. He lives in Sheffield with his wife Josie  I was an electrician and hardly missed a day of work in 40 years. Then, in 2005, I started losing my balance so Josie, my wife, suggested I see a doctor. It took about a year to get diagnosed with Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). I never felt sorry for myself: if the numbers of people getting ill need to be kept up, then I would rather it was me than any of my family. As a result of the MSA I&apos;ve developed another condition called cataplexy, which is triggered by strong emotions \u2013 laughter in my case. Once I start laughing I can&apos;t stop, and that triggers a seizure. It&apos;s very difficult to keep my emotions on an even keel. Josie says I&apos;ve turned into a miserable sod. There are things that bother me about having this disease \u2013 the fact that there&apos;s no cure being one. The idea of losing the ability to speak is hard. Josie and I are writing cards out so I can hold them up to communicate when the time comes. I&apos;ve been in a wheelchair for about a year now. I can walk with a frame, but it&apos;s getting harder. I have never believed in an afterlife, but Josie and my youngest daughter are both practising Christians and I&apos;ve been tilting towards their side of things recently. I&apos;m also finding peace in art. I spend most of my time at the hospice painting ties and scarves. I paint a lot of catfish because fishing is something I enjoy and can&apos;t do any more. If I could do one more thing in life, I&apos;d love to catch a really big catfish with my grandson. I feel lucky in that I&apos;ve had time to prepare. The reality is, we&apos;re all going to die \u2013 it&apos;s just I know of what and that my time is sooner rather than later. There won&apos;t be any hymns at my funeral. Hopefully, mine will be the last one of the day and I&apos;ll go out to Eric Clapton&apos;s &quot;Layla&quot; \u2013 turned up really, really loud. Diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease in 2000, Sarah Ezekiel, 42, was told she had three to five years to live When I was pregnant with my son, I noticed that the index finger on my left hand was slightly bent and my speech was slower, especially at night. I thought I&apos;d had a mild stroke or that my baby was lying on a\u00a0nerve. My doctor referred me to a neurologist, who I think knew immediately that I had Motor Neurone Disease (MND). I&apos;ll never forget the day I was diagnosed. I went to the doctor&apos;s with my husband, but he got fed up waiting so left me to receive my diagnosis alone. My neurologist didn&apos;t present MND in a negative way or give me a\u00a0prognosis (it&apos;s three to five years), so I\u00a0didn&apos;t understand the enormity of it. But the disease progressed rapidly once my son Eric (pictured below) was born. Within one year I was unable to use my hands. It was heartbreaking for me to watch carers do everything for my daughter and son. I want to hug and kiss them, but I can&apos;t. The worst physical aspect was the loss of speech. I can communicate using computers, but I can&apos;t make phone calls or join group conversations. I\u00a0miss that so much. I\u00a0divorced my husband in 2004. He&apos;d become abusive \u2013 I suppose because he was angry. We didn&apos;t talk for years, but we get on OK now. I miss being married, too. I thought about committing suicide early on, but I&apos;m pleased I didn&apos;t as I&apos;d have missed some wonderful experiences. Seeing my children grow up is by far the most rewarding reason for living. I believe I&apos;ve achieved more during my time with MND than when I was well. I was in a bad place for the first few years, but in 2005 I got a laptop which I could operate with my chin. That changed everything and I started writing about my experiences. I only read negative stories about MND after I was diagnosed, so I\u00a0hope I have helped other sufferers. I thought about death all the time initially, but I rarely do now. I&apos;m too busy getting on with life. I felt hopeless after my diagnosis, but managed to overcome that with support.

But they will be enough to cause problems for the latest Republican president candidate in the months ahead. Huntsman, from a podium in New Jersey, with the Statue of Liberty in the background, announced on Tuesday that he would join the race to take on his old boss for the White House next year. Confirming his intention to seek the nomination, he criticised the president&apos;s record and, in contrast with his time as ambassador when he projected American strength, portrayed the US as vulnerable. &quot;For the first time in our history, we are passing down to the next generation a country that is less powerful, less compassionate, less competitive and less confident than the one we got. This, ladies and gentlemen, is totally unacceptable and totally un-American,&quot; he said. Huntsman, 51, could be a formidable presidential candidate, given his experience in foreign affairs and as a former governor of Utah. But many Republicans cannot forgive the fact that he served in the Obama administration. The president approached Huntsman in 2009 and asked him to be the ambassador to Beijing, and Huntsman accepted, serving until this April. In that time, he worked alongside the Obama on issues ranging from climate change to human rights, and stood side by side with him when the president visited China. It is rare in US politics for someone who worked for one president to turn around and challenge him. Huntsman&apos;s work in the Obama administration is almost certain to be raised by Republican rivals. It could also undercut his attacks on the president. In the leaked diplomatic cables from Beijing, Huntsman is careful to avoid hostages to fortune. Some ambassadors are more flamboyant and comment at length, but Huntsman is strictly professional, sticking to reports of what Chinese leaders, officials, academics and human rights activists have told him and his colleagues in the embassy. There is little editorialising in them. In spite of that, there are moments when he does speak positively about Obama. In August 2009, he said, according to one of the leaked cables: &quot;President Obama had a good feel for the US-China relationship.&quot; He said he was looking forward to Obama&apos;s visit to China later that year. Huntsman&apos;s care in keeping praise for Obama to a minimum suggests he was thinking even then about entering the Republican race. Given that, the question is why he agreed to Obama&apos;s request to serve. Huntsman, a Mormon, spent two and a half years as a missionary in Taiwan and speaks Mandarin. Obama may have chosen him for his experience as a governor and Mandarin-speaker or may have asked him in an attempt to take him out of the Republican race. As well as having worked for Obama, another potential negative for Huntsman is that he was a strong believer in the importance of tackling climate change, an issue on which many Republicans, including some of his rivals have expressed scepticism. Huntsman has since reversed his position, dropping his support for a greenhouse gas cap. But in a meeting with Chinese president Hu Jintao at the Great Hall of the People, Huntsman identified climate change as one of three key topics, saying the two countries would have &quot;many opportunities to interact and work together on key global issues such as climate change and the environment, regional security and global finance&quot;. Huntsman again stressed that climate change is a priority the following month in a meeting with the foreign minister Yang Jiechi. Huntsman, again tying himself to Obama, &quot;expressed his and President Obama&apos;s hope to keep the US-China relations moving in a positive direction&quot; and noted US and Chinese interests &quot;were aligned on many aspects of the key issues of global economic recovery, regional security and climate change&quot;. Yang proposed that the US and China handle their differences &quot;discreetly to avoid public perception that there was friction between the two countries&quot;. In the cable at least, Huntsman did not respond. In other cables, particularly ahead of Obama&apos;s state visit to China, Huntsman sets out his views on a host of issues, from Chinese concern about a major US military presence in Afghanistan, through to human rights. On the latter, the ambassador said the Chinese record makes it difficult for the US to keep a low profile on the issue."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/22/global-smurfs-day-blue-colour", "publicationDate": "2011-06-22T19:00:01Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "sentences": ["And that&apos;s not all: the characteristically white-washed Spanish village of Juzcar has been painted blue to mark the occasion; Taiwan&apos;s famous Red House, a market hall and theatre built in 1908, will be transformed into a Blue House and filled with Smurfs; and Smurf figurines will go on display in Paris, Reykjavik, Bogot\u00e1, Geneva and Zurich."], "title": "Blue is the colour: it's Global Smurfs Day!", "article": "Saturday 25 June: Coldplay headline Glastonbury, it&apos;s the first Saturday of Wimbledon, and . . .

The equities since have decreased only slightly in value but the concern over Taiwan&apos;s water shortage has spiked as government and business leaders grapple with the development of a more coherent water usage policy. As a result, electronics and semiconductor sectors, responsible for Taiwan&apos;s rise as one of the &quot;Asian Tigers,&quot; face an uncertain future. Taiwan ranks second in the world in average annual precipitation, much of its rainfall occurs during sudden typhoons and the country&apos;s water infrastructure captures little of it. Most rain washes down the island&apos;s abundant mountains, and water storage has been especially problematic since the 1999 earthquake loosened soil that surround Taiwan&apos;s stressed dams. The per capita water consumption in Taiwan averages 271 liters (72 gallons) a day, higher than the average daily water usage of Europeans and even Americans. While agriculture continues to be Taiwan&apos;s most water-intensive industry, its semiconductor industry requires massive amounts of water and struggles to procure it. One reason for the high consumption of water is the low rates paid by residents throughout the country \u2013 one-tenth the price paid in most of Europe. Citizens have reacted with scorn to calls for increased water rates, even though the proposed increase would mean that families would pay only about $0.27 (17 cents) more per 1000 liters of water. Meanwhile, Taiwan&apos;s high tech sector, which has a water recycling rate that varies between 65 and 85%, struggles to stay compliant with the government&apos;s water rationing policy. The eye of the storm within Taiwan&apos;s water troubles is Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park, the country&apos;s 30-year old answer to Silicon Valley. Home to over 400 technology firms, Hsinchu also houses the world&apos;s two largest semiconductor foundries, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC). Both companies have taken the lead to improve water efficiency within Hsinchu. So far TSMC has set the water conservation bar the highest. At its Hsinchu foundry, the company collects about 32,000 tonnes of rainwater for reuse annually. TSMC&apos;s management team constantly looks out for any water-saving technique available. The company&apos;s water conservation programmes include: collecting water from air conditioning condensation for reuse; recycling systems effective to the point where the most toxic materials in waste slurry are scrubbed out and leave the purest water available for semiconductor processing; and a water infrastructure within its foundries that diverts recycled water to toilets and other facilities that do not require pure water. A recent water audit reveals that in 2009, the company saved 30 million tonnes of water, the equivalent necessary to provide a city with a population of 240,000 enough water for one year. Nevertheless, TSMC and its competitors are faced with not having water to meet their manufacturing needs. While the attention paid to Taiwan&apos;s water troubles has focused on electronics companies, the agriculture industry consumes 70% of the island&apos;s water but contributes only 1.6% to its GDP. The government wants to boost its national food self-sufficiency rate from 32 to 40% , which would make Taiwanese farmers \u2014 who receive most of their water for free \u2013 an even more powerful political bloc. Taiwan faces some tough choices ahead. The semiconductor industry has proven that it can adapt to uneven water supplies \u2014 but this critical sector for the economy often earns an iron fist from the government. Meanwhile, farmers get an enormous share of Taiwan&apos;s water but have not shown any willingness to conserve this precious resource. Ironically, an economy that exports so much technology abroad is unwilling to import knowledge that could help the country manage its vital and limited resource. If Taiwan fails to capitalise on its abundant rainfall more effectively, this Asian Tiger may lose some of the power in its roar.

People want their picture taken with her; they yell witticisms; she empties pubs just by stopping at the lights. And once they get talking to her, there is one question that everybody asks. Her neighbours have been saying it for months. Why, Mandy? Why? &quot;Do you know,&quot; she says, having clearly given it some thought, &quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot; But then what reasonable explanation would you suggest for covering one&apos;s car in photographs of Shane Richie? It was in 2002, when he joined EastEnders, that it began. &quot;I\u00a0just looked at him and thought, He&apos;s dishy, him,&quot; Crowther says. &quot;And it went from there.&quot; First she collected just pictures, though her husband Stan did not appreciate it. &quot;He&apos;d whinge. I&apos;d put EastEnders on, and he&apos;d be like, &apos;Oh God, not this again.&apos;&quot; She and Stan are separated now, after he left her last year for the teenage girlfriend of her oldest son. During that painful time, Richie \u2013 improbable as it may seem \u2013 became a symbol for her freedom. It was then the collecting took off seriously. &quot;I went really mad on him, downloading pictures, getting the mouse mat, everything to do with him, basically,&quot; she says, &quot;because I\u00a0wasn&apos;t allowed to do it before.&quot; With no official merchandise to gorge on, Crowther was forced to make everything herself, or have it made. A quick tour of her house reveals posters, a clock, a mug, key rings, and several fridge magnets, each one encasing a different photograph of Richie. Around her neck is her Richie pendant. His nearly finished portrait is tattooed on her back. Soon she hopes to have her wheelie bin done. Yet the car was always her ultimate dream. &quot;I was looking on the internet for ages, asking for prices.&quot; In the end, the best deal she found was from a local sign-making firm. &quot;The guys laughed and said, &apos;Yeah, we could do it. But it&apos;s going to cost you.&apos;&quot; The price was \u00a31,000, still too much, but her mother raised the money secretly from among her friends and\u00a0family. &quot;I\u00a0was ecstatic when I\u00a0saw it.

I love it to bits.&quot; The Terry Pratchett fan &apos;I hesitate to say we&apos;ve become friends&apos;     'My son said that when I die, all this is going\u00a0on eBay.'    &quot;I am a hoarder, not a collector,&quot; says Dr Patrick Harkin, a tutor of medical students at Leeds University, without a trace of shame.\u00a0The truth of this is on display around us. One could inventory the shelves and surfaces and cabinets that fill his house in Leeds and never quite be certain there was method in them. Examples: a souvenir potato shrivelled with desiccating gel; a\u00a0fibreglass facsimile of a medieval trunk; a box of fake teeth; a real and rather sharp scythe (with a blunt replacement &quot;party blade&quot;, part of a Death costume, which had to be imported from America); a murky jar reputedly containing an onion grown and pickled by Sir Terry Pratchett; a photograph of Sir Terry, shirtless, signing books; a shell casing fired by Sir Terry; a\u00a0knighthood certificate bestowed by Sir Terry; a convention lanyard worn by Sir Terry\u2026 Ah yes. A\u00a0theme\u00a0is beginning to emerge. &quot;He said that when I die, all this is going\u00a0on eBay,&quot; Harkin says, indicating his 22-year-old son, Patrick Jnr, who is our lugubrious companion on the tour. &quot;I had absolutely no chance being normal\u00a0growing up,&quot; Junior shoots back. &quot;I think I have been immunised, so I&apos;m not \u2013 sorry Dad \u2013 as mental as you are.&quot; His father thought the first Discworld book was &quot;hilarious&quot; when he borrowed it from a friend 25 years ago. Swiftly, he bought more. Queueing to have them signed by the author came next. And\u00a0within two years, he was spending the weekend of his birthday at the second British Discworld convention, not having known about the first. &quot;Then,&quot; he\u00a0says, &quot;it\u00a0sort of grew.&quot; What it grew into was a life inside\u00a0one of the world&apos;s most active\u00a0fan communities. Now Harkin\u00a0visits multiple conventions, in many countries, several times a year, often acting as their compere and auctioneer. Like many other fans, he often appears as an extra when Pratchett&apos;s books are filmed. In between events, he and the others keep in touch on thronging online message boards. For a man of his stature, Pratchett is unusually approachable, too. So,\u00a0having got to know him, Harkin has visited the author&apos;s home \u2013 and still occasionally receives phone calls to\u00a0research, for instance, &quot;how much force it\u00a0would take to rip a\u00a0man&apos;s head from his shoulders&quot;. &quot;I\u00a0hesitate to\u00a0say we&apos;ve become friends over the years,&quot; he cautions\u00a0me. Yet it will clearly be a heavy blow when the great man does eventually succumb to\u00a0Alzheimer&apos;s disease. Harkin expects to cope, he says wearily, &quot;by\u00a0a process of denial&quot;. The Mika fan &apos;Obviously I&apos;ve got a very accommodating husband&apos;     'It was December 2006, and I was just totally blown away.'    Mika was half Kath Drummond&apos;s age\u00a0when, relaxing in the hot tub at her home, she first heard him sing Grace Kelly on the radio. &quot;It was December 2006,&quot; she remembers, &quot;and I was just totally blown away.&quot; Immediately, she climbed out of the water and began Googling the singer&apos;s name. Within a fortnight, she had found and joined the Mika fan club, and within a year, her interest had spun into what she is now quite comfortable to call an obsession. First, she began using her savings to attend Mika gigs across Britain \u2013 then across Europe. With other fans, she shared travel costs and squeezed into cheap hotel rooms. &quot;Suddenly I was talking to people from Italy and they were inviting me to their homes,&quot; she recalls. &quot;The whole fan-club thing was such a community\u2026 My kids had grown up, and it just took over my life really.&quot; Nor has the passion waned, as Mika&apos;s moment did. When he is touring, Drummond still sees every show she can, documenting it in overflowing scrapbooks. &quot;Obviously I&apos;ve got a very accommodating husband,&quot; she says. Indeed. But then Dave Drummond knew what he was getting. His wife&apos;s life has been a string of passions, for the Bay City Rollers, for Liverpool Football Club, for Robbie Williams. &quot;He&apos;s been married to me for 27 years,&quot; she says. &quot;He knows that I&apos;m a nutter.&quot; In 2009, Drummond, who lives in\u00a0western Scotland, flew to\u00a0London, and approached Mika after a gig in Camden. Would he sign her wrist, she wanted to know, so she could get his autograph tattooed? At 45 years old, a coordinator for a childcare charity, it would be her first. &quot;He was shocked, I have to say,&quot; she says. &quot;But he thought about it for a while. I pleaded and did the puppy-dog eyes. So in the end he did.&quot; The adventure is recorded with especial thoroughness in her scrapbook. And here, the permanent record still shines bright and large on her left wrist: Mika&apos;s name and, above that and larger still, a drawing of a heart with wings. Is this a logo of his? &quot;Yes,&quot; Drummond admits, &quot;but I&apos;d only\u00a0asked him to sign his name. I mean,&quot; she adds quickly, &quot;I\u00a0do realise that I could have got rid of it. I literally had about 40 minutes back at home before the appointment. And I said to Dave, &apos;It&apos;s obviously bigger than I\u00a0thought\u00a0it was going to be. I\u00a0didn&apos;t\u00a0know that it was going to\u00a0be\u00a0the picture as well. He said he\u00a0was happy, so I just went with it.&quot; She also had her husband&apos;s initials, and their children&apos;s, added\u00a0on her leg. &quot;I suppose to appease my family,&quot; she says.  The Kylie Minogue fan &apos;It helped me through a\u00a0difficult childhood&apos;     'I go up to the merchandise stand and say, \"Can I have everything you\u2019ve got?\".'    Until this year, Elle Richardson had been to every British gig that Kylie Minogue has played. As determined a collector as she is a fan, she also saves up to perform a ritual at least once on every tour. &quot;I go up to the merchandise stand and say, &apos;Can I have everything you&apos;ve got?&apos; I usually hold up the queue. They&apos;re all saying, &apos;Oh my God, she&apos;s buying everything!&apos; The most it&apos;s ever cost me is about \u00a3650.&quot; Open the cupboards at her parents&apos; house in Hampshire, and you&apos;ll see what 25 years of this behaviour looks like: Kylie dolls, Kylie books, Kylie clothes, Kylie advent calendars, Kylie posters too gigantic to unfold, Kylie magazines, Kylie bowling bags, Kylie USB sticks, Kylie Easter eggs, Kylie programmes, Kylie records, cassettes, videos, CDs, DVDs, DAT tapes, even Kylie media files, downloaded and stored. To the best of her knowledge, she has tracked down almost every Kylie item of importance there is to own. She says she can recite, in date order, every single Kylie&apos;s released anywhere in the world. Yet these are now the relics of a\u00a0mania whose peak has passed. Richardson was six or seven when she first encountered Kylie, playing the feisty char, in five episodes of The Henderson Kids, an Aussie soap. Kylie&apos;s rise through Neighbours and on into the pop charts, became an inspiration to a girl at a difficult time in her childhood and who also dreamed of one day making a career in music. &quot;This stuff helped me through,&quot; she says. &quot;It was always something I could rely on, whereas I couldn&apos;t rely on anything else in life\u2026 It would always give me an uplift if I got a CD in the post from Taiwan or something.&quot; Now, however, at 32, Richardson is ready to relinquish the devotion that has sustained her for more than three quarters of her life. In April, for the first time, she allowed herself to miss some of Kylie&apos;s dates at the O2, and it has been years since she last looked through the older items at her parents&apos; house. Doing so today, her expression fluctuates between nostalgia and alarm. &quot;Bizarre,&quot; she says, over and over. Then: &quot;Getting my collection out to look at and talk about has made me re-evaluate what I really want to do with it, and what my plans are for the future. Maybe I have decided it&apos;s time to move on.&quot; When she is ready, there will be many buyers. The Neil Diamond fan &apos;My dream is to open a museum&apos;     'It\u2019s as accurate a portrayal of Neil Diamond\u2019s professional life as there can be.'    You might not expect a 56-year-old retired policeman to count another man&apos;s unwashed shirt and underpants among his most cherished possessions. But Ian Graham can explain. &quot;Many performers did it, Neil Diamond wasn&apos;t alone,&quot; he says. &quot;They used to have their shirt stitched to their\u00a0jockey shorts, because they would wear very tight-fitting trousers on stage and they wanted to make sure the shirt would not ruck up.&quot; And here is the proof. Held reverently in Graham&apos;s hands: the blue sequined shirt and black silk boxer shorts that Neil Diamond wore in 1984 for the Statue of Liberty&apos;s 100th birthday concert. Graham is aware that others might regard him as eccentric, or worse. But if one is going to spend one&apos;s life obsessed with Neil Diamond, it would surely be impossible to manage it more sensibly. All the items on display in his Surrey home are neatly framed and captioned \u2013 and substituted regularly &quot;for a change of scenery&quot;. Graham&apos;s vast collection of rare vinyl, meanwhile, is stored alphabetically by country along the wall in his converted loft. &quot;Angola, Argentina, Australia\u2026&quot; the boxes&apos; labels go. Wait\u2026 Angola? &quot;Yes.&quot; He nods. &quot;The country doesn&apos;t go into the system unless there&apos;s at least one.&quot; It was 1968 when Graham heard his first Neil Diamond record, on the public address system at Heart\u00a0of Midlothian football ground. The song was Solitary Man, and something about it moved the 13-year-old boy who sat alone in that\u00a0empty football stadium waiting\u00a0for the match to start. &quot;It\u00a0was very mournful,&quot; he says now.\u00a0&quot;I thought, Oh, I quite like this.&quot; But with little knowledge of\u00a0the singer, and no big record shop\u00a0in Hawick, his home town, it\u00a0took months to\u00a0find\u00a0the album. Even\u00a0before it\u00a0finally\u00a0arrived \u2013 before\u00a0he even\u00a0played it, you suspect\u00a0\u2013 the\u00a0bond was strong. Since then, through six different decades, he has followed Diamond&apos;s career avidly, and attended 184 of his concerts throughout the world, a number that will rise to 201 after this summer&apos;s European tour. His wife Jenny, a\u00a0&quot;fan by marriage&quot;, has been to 63. At all but the first 15 of those gigs, moreover, he has worn the same black and gold jumper, bearing the knitted legend &quot;Neil\u00a0Diamond. The Frog Who Would Be\u00a0King&quot; \u2013 a\u00a0reference to one of\u00a0the\u00a0singer&apos;s best known songs I Am\u2026 I Said. Like everything else in his collection \u2013 the plectrums, the guitar, the microphone-shaped soap (&quot;I&apos;ve been offered a small fortune for this&quot;) \u2013 the jumper looks pristine. Even now, a day when Graham does not listen to at least one Neil Diamond song is\u00a0highly unusual. His dream would\u00a0be to open a museum. &quot;It gives me enjoyment\u2026 It&apos;s as accurate a portrayal of Neil Diamond&apos;s professional life as there can be.&quot; This is the only explanation Graham can give, or\u00a0needs to. But how about Jenny, whose own cat collection does battle\u00a0with her husband&apos;s all around\u00a0the house, would she say the same? &quot;Sometimes she gets frustrated,&quot; he\u00a0admits. &quot;She says, &apos;Oh for goodness sake! Does it matter?&apos;&quot; He\u00a0pauses, considering the question.\u00a0&quot;But it does to me.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2011/jun/27/water-shares-up-on-bid", "publicationDate": "2011-06-27T16:39:04Z", "tags": ["Business", "Northumbrian Water", "United Utilities", "Severn Trent", "Rio Tinto", "Anglo American", "BHP Billiton", "Vedanta Resources", "Cairn Energy", "AstraZeneca", "Tesco", "Ocado", "Thorntons", "Inmarsat"], "sentences": ["The company was also supported by news that chief executive Tony Rice had bought 2.5m shares at 37.63p each Finally LPA, the lighting and electronics manufacturer, added 0.5p to 31p after it reported a half year profit of \u00a3151,000, compared to a \u00a3307,000 loss, and announced a \u00a31.6m contract for railway carriage equipment from Taiwan."], "title": "Water shares bubble up as Hong Kong group considers bid for Northumbrian", "article": "Water was on investors&apos; minds, not just because of the hot temperatures, but also thanks to a new round of takeover talk.

Any bid would be worth more than \u00a32bn, but CKI said there was no certainty a deal would happen. A Canadian fund, Ontario Teachers&apos; Pension Board, has 27% of Northumbrian, and there has been talk in the market that it would like to keep a stake if any takeover does go ahead.

Anglo added 27.5p to 2882.5p and BHP was 12.5p better at \u00a323.13. Vedanta, 57p higher at \u00a319.05, was also lifted by news of a renegotiation of its long-delayed deal to buy a stake in Cairn Energy&apos;s Indian business. The two sides have agreed Vedanta will pay $6.02bn for 40% of Cairn India, a reduction of around $600m. Vedanta will also buy an initial 10% before July 11, and the rest after government approval. As part of the deal the two sides have agreed a remove a non-compete provision. Cairn closed 4.4p better at 383.5p. But AstraZeneca lost 33p to \u00a330.26 after the latest trial results from its diabetes treatment dapagliflozin, developed with Bristol Myers Squibb. In general the results looked favourable although there were some cases of infections and two instances of cancer. Analyst Brian White at Shore Capital said:  As a novel agent we can expect these data to receive considerable scrutiny at the dapagliflozin Advisory Committee on July 19, especially given the apparent association between other diabetes agents (the glitazones) with bladder cancer.  Analysts at Killik &amp; Co said:  The diagnosis of bladder cancer in one trial patient will raise concerns, following recent newsflow over another diabetes drug, Actos, and its links to cancer.  Tesco dipped 0.8p to 396.5p. The supermarket group took analysts on a trip round some of its European operations last week, but Matrix said it only highlighted that not much had been achieved since the previous visit in 2002. Matrix analyst Tom Gadbsy said:  Nine years ago, there were around 12 western supermarket groups in central Europe. Tesco said at the time that there was not room for more than about five in any one country to operate profitably and that there would be attrition. One or two have dropped out, but others have joined the party, and the competition has, if anything, intensified with the arrival of Aldi and other hard discounters. Competition is a key reason why return on capital employed is just 5% in most of Tesco&apos;s markets, still well below the cost of capital.  The other main negative is that there has not been the expected move from traditional wet markets and local grocers to western-style supermarkets. Nine years ago, food sales through supermarkets were around 30%, and Tesco suggested that customer conversion to the format would see the growth rate seen in western Europe, from 30% to 90% abbreviated from 40 years to a fraction of that. Central Europe has seen the rate move from 30% to 45% in nine years, a very similar rate to the more organic growth in domestic markets. A similar failure to convert consumers in China, where capex is enormous (\u00a3100m per mall that Tesco opens) would see return on capital employed below the cost of capital for many years to come.  Meanwhile the company also said it planned to make its long expected push into UK banking this autumn. Among other retailers, Ocado fell 17p to 170p - below its flotation price - after disappointing results, with a lower than expected profit and worries about increased competition from Waitrose. Ahead of a strategic review on Tuesday Thorntons added 2.25p to 62.5p after the chocolate retailer agreed a new \u00a357.5m credit facility, at a one off cost of \u00a3400,000. It has also decided to outsource its distribution and warehouse arrangements to DHL, which it said would save it \u00a35m over the course of the six year deal. There will be initial transition costs of \u00a3680,000 in the first year of the contract. Inmarsat lost 10p to 542.5p after Citigroup cut its target price for the satellite company from 820p to 600p, blaming an uncertain outlook for its customers in the maritime sector and weakening demand from government agencies. Analyst Tania Valiente said:  We think there is still long-term value in the shares, but poor prospects for earnings momentum going into the second half of 2011 are likely to be a headwind for the stock.  But Cable &amp; Wireless Communications climbed 2p to 39.52p after Axa Private Equity bought a majority stake in its French peer Outremer. The company was also supported by news that chief executive Tony Rice had bought 2.5m shares at 37.63p each Finally LPA, the lighting and electronics manufacturer, added 0.5p to 31p after it reported a half year profit of \u00a3151,000, compared to a \u00a3307,000 loss, and announced a \u00a31.6m contract for railway carriage equipment from Taiwan.

Why isn&apos;t Amazon stamping out Kindlespam? &gt;&gt; John Naughton&quot;At first, I thought that Amazon&apos;s rationale might be similar to the one Google takes on the issue of infringing or objectionable YouTube content: given that 48-hours&apos;-worth of video is being uploaded every minute, it simply isn&apos;t feasible to pre-scan stuff before it&apos;s published. But Google will take it down on receipt of a complaint. That won&apos;t get Amazon off the Kindlespam hook for two reasons: (1) Compared with video, pre-scanning of text is perfectly feasible, and computationally not that difficult; Amazon could easily do it. (2) Detection of infringing content in Kindlespam by rights holders is very difficult for the reasons outlined earlier, so while a take-down-upon-complaint policy is perfectly feasible, complaints will be much less frequent than they are on YouTube. &quot;So we&apos;re left with a puzzle. Pre-scanning for crap, spam and infringing content in Kindlespam is perfectly feasible \u2014 and indeed only Amazon can do it effectively. Yet it does not do it.

(Via @zzap) Capital.bg : Nobody wants to buy RIM &gt;&gt; Asymco&quot;RIM is an engineering led company. Many successful companies rightly develop their engineering skills first because that is what allows them to create new products more quickly. This is true of Nokia and also of Apple and Microsoft in their early years. What is difficult is to allow marketing people to define products after that early phase. This is partly due to the fact that there is less respect for &quot;Marketing&quot; among engineers. Many see it as a &quot;soft&quot; discipline where there is little rigor. But this is not an accurate or fair picture. Great marketing determines what products should be built not just how they should be sold. Engineering can discover new products based on new technology becoming available, but Marketing can discover new products based on unmet user needs. Both need each other.&quot; Google May Choose Several Android Launch Partners For Ice Cream Sandwich &gt;&gt; mocoNews&quot;The most interesting part of the report, however, buried underneath the obsession with hardware specifications, is the notion that Google may be preparing to launch Ice Cream Sandwich (the next version of Android) with multiple partners. If you&apos;ll recall, a few months ago several Android partners raised quite a stir complaining about Google&apos;s practice of picking a single vendor as the primary launch partner for a new generation of technology. &quot;However, if Google really is planning to shake things up and launch Ice Cream Sandwich devices spread out across Samsung, Motorola (NYSE: MMI), LG (SEO: 066570), and perhaps others, it would be a notable change to how Android partners roll out new devices.

In response to a comment by Peter Mandelson about the selection of these places, Wen thanked the previous Chinese ambassador Fu Ying for her advice, but said that Shakespeare was his own choice. He returned to the subject of his boyhood love of Shakespeare in his speech to David Cameron. Shakespeare occupies an interesting position in China, where major foreign writers such as Dickens, Conan Doyle, Balzac, Stendhal and the Russians were translated in the early 20th century and soon became household names. Many Chinese, including political leaders, take pride in being well-read. By contrast, how many English people, let alone political leaders, could name China&apos;s foremost 18th-century novelist, or the great poets of the 8th century? Though Dickens has always been politically correct, there are aspects of Shakespeare that have occasionally caused unease in China. There are his histories, dramas of the death of kings, and the overthrow of tyrannical rulers and even Hamlet contains &quot;political allusions too sensitive for a supreme dictator&quot; and a &quot;hero too tentative for the nation&apos;s militant cause&quot;. Though the plays were published in Mao&apos;s China, it was not until after his death in 1976 that they were actually performed publicly. In the 1980s and 1990s there were hectic Shakespeare festivals in China. The 1986 festival featured 28 productions of 12 different plays within a fortnight, including the Merchant of Venice performed in English by the Arts Academy of the People&apos;s Liberation Army, Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream performed by the China Coal Miner&apos;s Drama Troupe and Othello by the China Railways Drama Group. After the appearance of the first translations in the early 20th century, for much of the period from 1949 to the late 1970s, Shakespeare was known only through the text and any literary criticism was rooted firmly in Marxism and Leninism. King Lear was described as &quot;a portrayal of the shaken economic foundations of feudal society&quot; and Romeo and Juliet, &quot;the desire of the bourgeoisie to shake off the yoke of the feudal code of ethics&quot;. However, in 1979, the Old Vic Company performed Hamlet in Shanghai with a simultaneous translation, and in 1983 the famous actor Ying Ruocheng translated and directed The Merchant of Venice at the People&apos;s Art Theatre in Beijing. Many of Shakespeare&apos;s stories have almost universal appeal and have been adapted to various traditional Chinese forms. I saw a very lively and amusing Peking Opera version of Othello in the mid 1980s, which showed how easily the story could translate, while Shakespeare&apos;s language can be very difficult. In China, the stories came first, with Lamb&apos;s Tales From Shakespeare &quot;translated&quot; in 1903. Lin Shu has been described as &quot;the most popular English-Chinese translator of the early 20th century who rewrote in classical Chinese prose a large number of novels by 19th-century writers including Dickens, Scott, Hugo and Balzac.&quot; &quot;Re-wrote&quot; is the key to Lin Shu&apos;s approach for he said &quot;I have no foreign languages&quot; but &quot;several gentlemen who interpret the texts for me.&quot; China&apos;s foremost 20th-century playwright Tian Han translated Romeo and Juliet in 1922, when he was a student in Japan so this, too, was probably a third-hand version. The two major translators of Shakespeare in China were Zhu Shenghao (1912-1944), who almost managed the complete works before his death from TB, and Liang Shiqiu (1903-1987), about whom more is known. He studied at Harvard and Columbia universities and conceived the idea of translating Shakespeare in 1930, finally finishing the task in 1967. Liang became a professor of English, teaching at Peking University and Tsinghua University and argued bitterly with leftwing writers such as the great scholar, satirist and short-story writer Lu Xun before moving to Taiwan in 1949. He translated Peter Pan, Silas Marner, Wuthering Heights and, unsurprisingly, given his disagreements with the left wing, Animal Farm. His own collected essays were published in English in Hong Kong under the faintly unfortunate title From a Cottager&apos;s Sketchbook. Liang&apos;s Shakespeare translations were more confident that Zhu&apos;s. His witches in the opening scene of Macbeth speak in regular lines of seven syllables, not in rhyme, but with the cadence of poetry, whilst Zhu&apos;s witches speak in prose. On the other hand, Zhu&apos;s translation of Hamlet&apos;s &quot;To be or not to be&quot; soliloquy retains the balance and repetition of the verb whilst Liang&apos;s rendering is complex: &quot;To live or to destroy, this is a question which merits thought&quot;. Both have their partisans. It is likely that Wen read Liang&apos;s version of the Complete Works since, despite Liang&apos;s defection to Taiwan, they were published in a good new edition in Beijing in 1954 when the future premier was 14. A self-confessed Shakespeare lover, Wen is a geologist by training, but he is well known in China for beginning many of his speeches with a poetic reference and the usefulness of Shakespeare in that context has not passed him by. But neither should we ignore the possibility that his stress on Shakespeare during his visit to England is a graceful gesture, a reminder that culture is important, both at home and in international relations and that this visit need not be entirely devoted to economic questions."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/28/iphone-5-one-or-two", "publicationDate": "2011-06-28T15:03:38Z", "tags": ["iPhone", "Apple", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Technology"], "sentences": ["He does, though, agree with the view put forward by Whitmore and Dediu that if Apple were to go after the prepaid market with a less expensive phone, that it could have a dramatic effect on the market; his analysis is that next year Android will take a commanding lead - except that &quot;if Apple does a cheap iPhone, all bets are off.&quot; Also in the &quot;one iPhone&quot; camp is Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley, who came back from a week of meetings in Taiwan (reports Fortune) saying that she expects iPhone and iPad production to &quot;begin ramping up aggressively&quot; from August."], "title": "Will there be one or two iPhone 5s in September? Here's how to tell", "article": "Call it the battle of the analysts, because only one group can be correct. At issue: will Apple unveil one new iPhone in September - or two? At issue may be the reputations of some of the finance industry&apos;s biggest names. First, the predictions of two iPhones. Chris Whitmore of Deutsche Bank suggested in a note to clients on Monday morning that he understood that Apple was to launch both a high-end &quot;iPhone 5&quot; and a low-end &quot;iPhone 4S&quot; (our money&apos;s still on 4G): &quot;With Nokia and RIMM struggling,&quot; he writes, &quot;the time is right for Apple to aggressively penetrate the mid range smart-phone market (i.e. $300-500 category) to dramatically expand its [total addressable market] and market share.&quot; (First reported at Fortune.) Whitmore&apos;s argument is that an unlocked, lower-priced iPhone 4S with a prepaid voice plan would &quot;drive significantly greater penetration&quot; into the countries where Apple already has distribution. Pre-paid: where the customers are It&apos;s the pre-paid market that is potentially so valuable, as everyone acknowledges. Over at Asymco, Horace Dediu has crunched some of the numbers (though he doesn&apos;t express any opinion on how many phones Apple might announce, or even when):   the global split between pre-/post-paid subscribers as of 2010...[shows that] roughly 1.5 billion are post-paid and 3.7 billion are pre-paid. That means that nearly 70% of the world is not being addressed by the iPhone as it currently stands. Put another way, a shift in positioning might result in a 250% increase in addressable market.  Dediu also points out that &quot;most pre-paid subs see a full price for the iPhone (retail around $700 to $1000) vs. post-paid customers seeing a price of $200 or below. The $200 happens to be an important psychological price inflection point where volumes increase dramatically.&quot; So the logical thing in that case, if Apple is going for market share - which it certainly did with the iPod, segmenting the market from top to bottom - is to come up with at least two different phones, one for the high-end contract market, and another for the lower-end prepaid market. If you don&apos;t think that the iPhone remains an object of desire, you haven&apos;t been reading the reports of people having their phones stolen which then end up in distant lands (in this case, Vietnam).  Obviously, providing a $200 iPhone wouldn&apos;t stop theft. There might be the smidgen of a chance it would slightly reduce it, though. Fortune has a graphic showing the breakdown between prepaid (no contract) in red and postpaid/contract (in blue) by geographic region, which graphically demonstrates how valuable the prepaid market is - if, that is, you can price your product to sell there.      Prepaid (red) v contract (blue) customers by proportions in regions where iPhone is on sale. Source: Fortune, Deutsche Bank, carriers     So, a priced-to-sell prepay iPhone? No, says Keith Bachman of BMO Capital, who has slapped the idea down. He favours the single phone approach: an iPhone 4S (4G! We keep telling you!) On the Barrons blog, he&apos;s quoted insisting that there won&apos;t be a second new iPhone; &quot;we believe that the 3GS will be the low-end iPhone,&quot; he said in a research note. This is, of course, pretty much what already happens - but the fact that the 3GS doesn&apos;t have SHINY NEW attached to it limits its appeal in some markets. Those are the places where sales of Android handsets, built and priced to shift, are rocketing. No second iPhone? Richard Windsor of Nomura is also in the &quot;no second iPhone&quot; camp: he has said on more than one occasion that his sources in the Far East see no signs of the sort of ramping up and extra supply chain recruitment that would imply a second iPhone. He does, though, agree with the view put forward by Whitmore and Dediu that if Apple were to go after the prepaid market with a less expensive phone, that it could have a dramatic effect on the market; his analysis is that next year Android will take a commanding lead - except that &quot;if Apple does a cheap iPhone, all bets are off.&quot; Also in the &quot;one iPhone&quot; camp is Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley, who came back from a week of meetings in Taiwan (reports Fortune) saying that she expects iPhone and iPad production to &quot;begin ramping up aggressively&quot; from August. To which one replies: well, yes, because that&apos;s when you&apos;re heading into the peak Christmas period. Obviously you&apos;d do that. Huberty thinks there will only be the one iPhone, and that the launch might not be until late September - in which case she&apos;s reducing her estimate for iPhones sold by 2m for the quarter. If there&apos;s an early September launch, then she&apos;s putting those 2m back into the July-September quarter. (There&apos;s more detail on her estimates in this screenshot from Fortune.) Can&apos;t (iPod) Touch this Finally, one idea which pushes us back towards the &quot;two iPhones&quot; argument: the iPod Touch is not included in Apple&apos;s Back-to-School promotion in the US. In previous years, this has included a free iPod Touch; this year it&apos;s going to be a $100 iTunes Gift Card. That in itself is most intriguing, because Apple has updated the iPod Touch over the past two years; if it&apos;s leaving it out of the promotion... why? Could it be because it&apos;s got a phone coming (and secondary school kids pretty much all have phones now, after all) that will be at a price to tempt school kids? Only one question then remains: how, exactly, could Apple build a phone down to that key $200-$300 price tag? It&apos;s not true to say that Apple doesn&apos;t know how to build for low prices - there&apos;s nobody challenging the iPad for quality at the price it goes at. (Though stay tuned for developments this week...) What would it be like? The possibilities that have been aired are that it will have a smaller screen (unlikely) or less storage (much more likely) and slower processor (likely). Another possibility that few seem to have considered is that the high-end phone could have a larger screen (perhaps like the Galaxy II?) and more storage - so that any new &quot;cheaper&quot; iPhone would, in specification, resemble previous iPhones, but have a new look (and hence street cred) while costing Apple nothing more in terms of raw components as the 3GS it presently sells. To figure out whether there&apos;s really a second iPhone coming, therefore, watch for signs of the 3GS supplies drying up in the next couple of months. Since that&apos;s the most likely low-end configuration, any slowing in supplies would mean they&apos;re being diverted to the &quot;new&quot; low-end iPhone. And if that happens then as Nomura&apos;s Windsor says, it really is going to get interesting."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/journalismcompetition/indian-girls-persuade-parents-they-are-too-young-for-marriage", "publicationDate": "2011-06-29T14:35:52Z", "tags": ["Amateur Longlist 2011"], "sentences": ["&quot;Ideally within 15 years, certainly in 25.&quot; She cites countries like Taiwan where bold policies and heavy investment in education and health made child marriage virtually disappear within a generation."], "title": "International Development Journalism Competition: Indian girls persuade parents they are too young for marriage", "article": "Dressed in crisp white saris, 14-year-old Seema and 13-year-old Rumi giggle together outside the adolescent girls&apos; club in their tea plantation village in Dibrugarh, north-east India. For the friends, the blue-painted clubhouse is more than just somewhere to socialise \u2013 it&apos;s where they are forging bonds that are transforming their futures.  After learning that Seema&apos;s family were planning an early marriage for her, Rumi and other club members began a concerted campaign of visits to her parents and grandmother. The teenagers&apos; well-informed arguments convinced the family to let Seema complete her education and wait till she was emotionally and physically ready to become a wife and mother. &quot;Now it&apos;s not our time to get married,&quot; explains Rumi, a confident girl with dark wavy hair pulled back in a neat ponytail. &quot;We&apos;ll not get to play. We&apos;ll not get to go to school.&quot; Marriage under 16 is illegal in India, but a national survey last year showed almost half of girls were younger when married. Local police turn a blind eye to what is a commonly accepted practice, especially in rural areas like Dibrugarh.  The UN considers child marriage a human rights violation that curtails a girl&apos;s education and can condemn her to a life of poverty. Adolescent childbirth is dangerous. UN figures show that girls under 15 are five times more likely to die in labour than those in their 20s, while the child of a teenage mother is less likely to survive till their first birthday.  With limited power, young married girls are vulnerable to domestic violence. A 2004 study in two Indian states found girls married before 18 were twice as likely to report beatings by their husbands and three times more likely to report being forced to have sex than older brides. To spread the message that early marriage is unacceptable, NGOs including Unicef are working with regional government bodies across India to set up Adolescent Girls&apos; Clubs Against Child Marriage. In Dibrugarh district alone, more than 16,000 girls are registered in 460 clubs.  Their influence is helping persuade traditional child marriage advocates such as Seema&apos;s grandmother of the value of postponing. &quot;We now know difficulties can arise, like girls getting married at an early age may have problems giving birth,&quot; she says. &quot;Before, such things were not discussed at all.&quot; Unicef India&apos;s Child Protection Officer, Jose Bergua, says the clubs succeed because they get people talking more openly about early marriage and its consequences. &quot;A harmful social practice like child marriage occurs for many reasons, but one of them is a taboo around debating it,&quot; he says. &quot;Everybody believes the community expects them to behave a certain way, even if many individuals privately disagree. Breaking the silence around child marriage is vital.&quot; Club networks offer a lifeline to girls facing early marriages, he adds, giving them the courage to resist family pressure. They also support parents concerned that defying community expectations will leave their daughters ostracised and branded &apos;unmarriageable&apos;. Many families believe early marriage will safeguard their children&apos;s future. &quot;A post-puberty unmarried girl is usually viewed as a ticking time-bomb,&quot; explains Indian broadcaster and women&apos;s expert Mrinal Pande. &quot;Most parents heave a sigh of relief if they can transfer the burden.&quot; &quot;One reason for early marriage in poor villages and urban slums is the constant threat of violence,&quot; she continues. &quot;Unmarried girls left alone while parents work are highly vulnerable to being raped or coerced into sexual relationships.&quot;  &quot;There&apos;s a pan-Indian custom that if one girl in the family brings dishonour, her sisters&apos; marriage proposals will be turned down. Early marriage precludes that possibility, families feel.&quot; Pande believes poverty is the main reason for child marriages. Marrying girls young is cheaper. Families can avoid paying high dowry fees that increase with age. In regions like Rajasthan mass-weddings of adolescent sisters are common as parents cut costs with a one-off ceremony. Girls from poor households are almost twice as likely to marry before 18 as girls in higher income homes, according to anti-poverty charity International Center for Research on Women (ICRW).  To counter this, an Indian government programme in northern Haryana state is offering poor families a long-term cash bond, to be redeemed if their daughters remain unmarried when they turn 18. ICRW&apos;s child marriage campaigner Anju Malhotra will evaluate how successful the new &apos;Apni Beti, Apna Dhan&apos; (My Daughter, My Wealth) scheme has been when the first group celebrate that milestone next year. &quot;In a growing economy, there&apos;s good reason to hope the cash incentive will trump cultural and traditional concerns,&quot; she says. &quot;It might be the nudge parents on the verge of making that mental shift need \u2013 especially as they see more girls at school and moving around the community and realise it&apos;s becoming acceptable to keep unmarried teenage daughters at home.&quot; \u00a0 &quot;The idea is that as more parents begin thinking that way, fears about sexual exploitation, reputation and bucking custom start to recede. \u00a0The money could also allay worries over expensive dowries.&quot;  Malhotra believes educating girls and communities is helping to change attitudes, but too slowly. &quot;We need big solutions to eliminate child marriage,&quot; she says. &quot;National infrastructure, government incentives \u2013 things that will work repeatedly, benefitting millions of girls.&quot;  She hopes that if the cash pilot scheme shows the rupees are well spent, politicians will be convinced to roll it out nationwide. The Indian government is committed to eliminating child marriage, but Unicef&apos;s Bergua describes its response as &quot;lukewarm&quot;, given low priority and limited resources. But there&apos;s hope for India&apos;s child brides. Malhotra and Bergua agree that ending early marriage is entirely possible. &quot;We know it can be done,&quot; says Malhotra. &quot;Ideally within 15 years, certainly in 25.&quot; She cites countries like Taiwan where bold policies and heavy investment in education and health made child marriage virtually disappear within a generation. &quot;Every child who gets married is a tragedy,&quot; says Bergua. &quot;But every child like Seema whose marriage is prevented is a tremendous victory for India. And more of those are happening every day.&quot; This feature was written for the Guardian International Development Journalism competition before 13 June 2011."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jul/04/microsoft-baidu-china-search-engines", "publicationDate": "2011-07-04T21:27:32Z", "tags": ["Search engines", "Microsoft", "Internet", "Computing", "Google", "Yahoo", "Technology", "China", "World news", "Censorship", "Technology sector", "Business", "US news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Bing \u2014 which filters out results in China relating to controversial subjects, such as political dissidents, Taiwan or pornography, to be able to operate in the country \u2014 has a negligible share of the market, while Google has nearly 20% counting visits to its offshore sites, making it the second-biggest in China."], "title": "Microsoft strikes deal with China's biggest search engine Baidu", "article": "Microsoft has signed a deal with Baidu, the biggest search engine in China, to provide English-language search results \u2014 but they will be censored to meet the Chinese government&apos;s demands. The announcement of the deal is a boost to Microsoft, which has been struggling to boost the position of its Bing search engine against Google&apos;s dominance in almost every country around the world. It will also be a boost for Baidu, which has ambitions internationally. Baidu has roughly 83% of the Chinese search market, but there are also up to 10m English searches per day, the company said. The Chinese market comprises roughly 470m users, despite only about 30% of the population having internet access. Bing \u2014 which filters out results in China relating to controversial subjects, such as political dissidents, Taiwan or pornography, to be able to operate in the country \u2014 has a negligible share of the market, while Google has nearly 20% counting visits to its offshore sites, making it the second-biggest in China. Yahoo has 6% and Microsoft&apos;s Bing 4%, according to Net Applications. English-language searches to Baidu will be redirected through Bing. Kaiser Kuo, a spokesman for Baidu, said that Bing searches would not be censored any more &quot;than they already do&quot;. Google shut down its search service on the Chinese mainland in March 2010 after alleging that government-inspired hackers had broken into the systems for its email and source codes to its wider network. Google&apos;s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, had been unhappy at the idea of submitting to China&apos;s censorship for search results, and declared after the hacking incident that they would stop censoring them. Instead the company added a simplified Chinese service for mainland users to its search operation in Hong Kong. Some analysts were sceptical over how much demand there would be for English search on Baidu. &quot;It&apos;s a good thing, but I see very minimal impact for Baidu. I don&apos;t see a lot English keywords going through Baidu. It goes through Google,&quot; said Wallace Cheung, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Credit Suisse. Search engine marketing company Greenlight said it saw the deal as positive for both sides, and could envisage the new partners dominating the Chinese search-advertising market. &quot;Whilst it represents an opportunity for Bing to make more money from the Chinese market, Baidu gets what it needs to expand overseas when it is ready to do so,&quot; said Greenlight Chief Operating Officer Andreas Pouros. &quot;Microsoft has entered the Chinese market slowly and has made some friends, in a way that the Chinese government will have no issue with. This should leave Baidu and Bing to control the Chinese search ad market without too much difficulty.&quot; Baidu made $1.2bn in online marketing revenues last year, up 78% from 2009. Microsoft&apos;s total online advertising revenue in fiscal 2010, including a small contribution from Bing, was $1.9bn. However Bing loses almost as much money as it takes in. Microsoft may be satisfied with delivering censored results.

Smith never saw that place \u2013 he was gunned down in his prison cell \u2013 but his followers did after being driven out of America by persecution and making a 1,300-mile trail across the plains. The bolthole they found was a basin almost wholly enclosed in the protective embrace of the Rocky mountains in what was still at that time Mexico. A century and a half later, the community they built there not quite in a day, Salt Lake City, stands as a monument to the refusal of those early believers to be cowed by American intolerance. Today, Mormons, far from being outcasts, find themselves at the very core of America&apos;s cultural and political debate. On Broadway, The Book of Mormon has become the biggest musical hit in years. In politics, from the Democratic Senate leader, Harry Reid, to Tea Party darling Glenn Beck, Mormons are front and centre stage. And, at the height of what is being called a &quot;Mormon moment&quot;, two latter-day saints are in the race for the White House. But it might be precipitous for the 2012 candidates, Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman, to declare the old animosity towards Mormonism over. A poll last month found 22% of Americans unwilling to vote for a Mormon as presidential nominee of their party, a level of bias higher now than it was in the 1960s. By contrast, opposition to black, female, Catholic or Jewish presidents has steadily declined since the 1950s. The last time 22% of Americans said they would refuse to vote for a Catholic president was in 1959 (though they promptly confounded the pollsters and elected John F Kennedy). Such stubborn antagonism is familiar to Romney, the putative frontrunner among the current field of Republican candidates for 2012, who arrives in London for a fundraising event. When he last ran for the White House in 2008 he faced a barrage of accusations about his &quot;false religion&quot; and its approval of polygamy \u2014 a practice that the church ditched in 1890 to become a part of America with the creation of the state of Utah. So troubled was Romney by the outcry that he felt obliged to address the subject in a speech in which he promised that if he were elected he would &quot;serve no one religion, no one group, no one cause&quot;. &quot;We were all surprised early in the 2008 campaign when we saw an outpouring of out-and-out prejudice,&quot; said Michael Otterson, the Mormon church&apos;s head of public affairs. &quot;Naively we thought that people would look at us and see people of good values, but instead we heard all this nonsense about cults. It showed us we had a lot of work to do. We still do.&quot; Romney and Huntsman have a lot of work to do too, judging from the polls. At face value, the two men have much in common. They both come from rich, powerful Mormon families: Romney&apos;s father was governor of Michigan and Huntsman&apos;s invented the plastic boxes Big Macs are sold in. They share an ancestor, Parley Pratt, a contemporary of Joseph Smith&apos;s, making them distant cousins. They both served as Mormon missionaries. Romney went to France and Huntsman to Taiwan, where he learned the Mandarin that was a factor when President Obama appointed him ambassador to China. But despite their similarities, the two men wear their faith utterly differently. Romney, 64, takes a traditional approach, professing his love of his faith and making the Mormon-dominated state of Utah the centre of his fundraising activities. In 2008 Utah contributed more than $5m to his campaign, far more per capita than anywhere else. &quot;Romney has the sense of the slightly older generation, and is constantly explaining what Mormonism is,&quot; said Matthew Burbank, a political science professor at the University of Utah. &quot;Huntsman, on the other hand, says &apos;Yes, I&apos;m a Mormon, but \u2026&apos;&quot; Huntsman has a very large family, which in itself is typical of a Mormon, but has made a point of introducing diversity into the upbringing of his seven children. One daughter was married in an Episcopalian church, and another, adopted from India, is being raised in the Hindu tradition. In a recent Time interview, Huntsman said: &quot;I&apos;m a very spiritual person and proud of my Mormon roots,&quot; which to many Mormons came across as a less than ringing endorsement of the faith. Huntsman&apos;s ambivalence might reflect his younger age \u2013 he is 51 \u2013 or it could point to a conscious strategy to avoid the issue. But should his White House bid become serious, as some observers think it could despite his relative obscurity, he will find it hard to sidestep the question entirely. At the core of the problem is the attitude of many evangelical Christians, almost a third of whom dislike the idea of a Mormon president. That is particularly relevant in the early caucus state of Iowa and in the south, where the Republican nomination is often lost or won. &quot;It&apos;s a false religion and that&apos;s dangerous,&quot; said Warren Cole Smith, associate publisher of Christian news magazine World. &quot;If either Romney or Huntsman were elected to the highest office in this country that would be like a shot in the arm for Mormonism.&quot; Both candidates have indicated that they might bypass Iowa and focus instead on early states such as New Hampshire and Florida where evangelicals are less prevalent. The Mormon church itself refuses to engage in party politics, and will not comment on either candidacy. But the question of how the faith is perceived within America is close to its heart, as is therefore the presence of two Mormons in the race. &quot;There is a conversation going on, and church leaders see this as an opportunity to set the record straight and explain who we are,&quot; said Otterson. What if Romney or Huntsman should go all the way to the White House? What would the church think then? &quot;We are just waiting and seeing,&quot; he said. A very American faith The irony about the persistent distrust of Mormonism in America is that it is a quintessentially American religion. At its core is the belief that Jesus had made a visitation to America after his resurrection, converting a family of Israelites who had migrated there and establishing a messianic kingdom. That makes it the religious equivalent of the theory of American exceptionalism at the heart of much of the country&apos;s political discourse. The church was founded in 1830 by Joseph Smith, son of a poor New England farmer. At 14, then living in upstate New York, he started having visions in which he was visited by God, Jesus and an angel called Moroni. Moroni revealed to him a book, buried in a hill, made of golden plates and written in an ancient language by an Israelite prophet. Smith magically translated the Book of Mormon, which recounted the story of Jesus in America. From its inception, the church heavily emphasised the value of proselytising. It now has 14 million members and has spread across Latin America, Europe and Africa. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 July 2011. The original referred to the belief that Jesus made a second coming to America after his resurrection.

I stood up from my chair and burst out crying.

It&apos;s so funny, everybody is crying at Antony&apos;s concerts and everybody was crying in Moma when they were sitting opposite me.&quot; Indeed, there seems nothing at all unusual about Hegarty collaborating with\u00a0a performance artist. For one thing, his roots are in experimental theatre, and for another, the relationship between rock\u00a0and pop and performance art appears to be blossoming as never before. In 2011, the biggest pop star in the world is Lady Gaga, a product of the same downtown New York club scene that spawned Hegarty, where what Gaga describes as an\u00a0&quot;interesting hybrid of performance art\u00a0meets singer-songwriter-meets-drag-meets-theatre-meets-rock&quot; is the common\u00a0currency. &quot;When I was really young, I was fascinated with performance artists,&quot; Lady Gaga says, on the phone from Taiwan. &quot;Leigh Bowery, Klaus Nomi. And\u00a0when I got older I became fascinated with Yoko Ono and Marina Abramovic. I grew up with them, and sort of naturally became the artist I am today. It wasn&apos;t until I started to play out in New York and\u00a0my friends said, &apos;Look how much this\u00a0has influenced you,&apos; that I realised it. The one thing there wasn&apos;t on the Lower East Side was pop music. So as a pop songwriter, I thought that would be an interesting way to make a name for myself\u00a0in this neighbourhood. I figured if\u00a0I\u00a0could play the grocery store around the\u00a0corner as if it was Madison Square Gardens, maybe some day I can assimilate pop music into performance art in a more\u00a0mainstream way.&quot; Looking at her sales figures,\u00a0you have to say Gaga\u00a0has succeeded beyond\u00a0her wildest dreams: you wonder how the record labels who she says turned her down because they felt a mainstream audience couldn&apos;t stomach the more outr\u00e9 aspects of her performances feel now. Equally, you can see their point: pop and performance art traditionally have a very\u00a0strained relationship. One theory is that rock\u00a0and pop audience&apos;s negative reaction to anything that smacked of\u00a0performance art was simply a legacy\u00a0of public animosity towards Yoko\u00a0Ono, the first performance artist to\u00a0take her work to a pop audience: even\u00a0before she met John Lennon, she performed Cut Piece, during which the audience were invited to attack her clothing with scissors at 1967&apos;s 14 Hour Technicolour Dream event at Alexandra Palace in London. &quot;I thought what we were doing was high art, and there was a big difference between high art and pop\u00a0music,&quot; Ono says. &quot;High art\u00a0inspires the human culture, pop music\u00a0is entertainment. The mixture of high art with entertainment, which you needed to do so that people would accept\u00a0it\u00a0and understand what you were trying to do, was very\u00a0challenging and interesting to me.&quot; But her association with Lennon and her move from performance work into making music \u2013 &quot;it was easier to go into the\u00a0studio and make music with John rather than say to him I was going to do a big performance piece in Paris. It was about us being together, using the situation&quot; \u2013 was, initially at least, met with\u00a0derision and outrage. &quot;Before I started working with John, I felt I was\u00a0 communicating pretty well, actually. When I got together with John, I thought that I was doing the same thing, but suddenly the hostility was there. High art\u00a0is never accepted by the masses,&quot; she says. &quot;I accepted that a long time ago. I had\u00a0a great time with John. There was great love between us. Those things counted more to me than being accepted by the people.&quot; There&apos;s an argument that the public&apos;s dim, if deeply unfair view of\u00a0Ono \u2013 the woman who was held to\u00a0have ruined the\u00a0Beatles \u2013 tainted their attitude to performance artists\u00a0who dared to dabble in rock\u00a0music for years to come. Others feel the reasons are less straightforward. Abramovic thinks music and performance art fit perfectly together (&quot;they&apos;re the highest forms of art because they&apos;re the most direct and the most immaterial&quot;), but Laurie Anderson, who found herself catapulted from the New\u00a0York performance art scene to pop stardom with the release of her 1981 single O Superman, initially felt the two worlds were entirely opposed to each other: performance art was by definition ephemeral, existing only in the moment of performance, which is the antithesis of\u00a0making a record, something she only did because\u00a0she got a grant of $500 and a friend argued she was being\u00a0elitist. &quot;Records were part of\u00a0pop culture and I was a snob,&quot; she says.\u00a0&quot;Pop culture was for 10-year-olds. Nothing against 10-year-olds, but I was part of the\u00a0avant garde, and we didn&apos;t want\u00a0to be\u00a0part\u00a0of pop culture.&quot; She subsequently revised her opinion and entered into the world of rock wholeheartedly, but still feels performance artists are a difficult fit in the music business. &quot;It&apos;s odd because people from record companies used to feel they could come into the studio and sit back and go: &apos;Think this needs more bass.&apos; I wasn&apos;t really using bass. I was using things like a\u00a0lot of birds. And I think those guys would have felt silly saying: &apos;I think you need more birds.&apos;&quot; She laughs. &quot;I guess I was one of their vanity artists or something.&quot; Dan Fox, senior editor of art magazine Frieze, thinks the problem may have lain with mainstream antipathy to the visual arts in general. &quot;We&apos;re suspicious of the visual arts because it&apos;s seen as somehow pretentious or a con job: if it&apos;s about the intangible and\u00a0the ineffable, the idea that art can exist as an idea as much as a physical object that shows some degree of manufacturing or technical prowess, people\u00a0are suspicious, and that&apos;s also fed\u00a0by the connotations of the art world: big amounts of money, exclusivity, elitism.\u00a0In rock music you have all these debates about being real and authentic, you know, three chords and the truth, that\u00a0kind of thing. There&apos;s an idea that having some kind of different approach to\u00a0performance is somehow antithetical to rock, because it&apos;s not about paying your\u00a0dues.&quot; Whatever the reason, when three members of the confrontational performance art collective Coum Transmissions decided to form Throbbing Gristle in\u00a01976 \u2013 &quot;We were disgusted and disillusioned with the art world, it was too\u00a0formalised and institutionalised for us, and we were excited by sound&quot; says TG&apos;s Cosey Fanni Tutti \u2013 they seemed to succeed in upsetting\u00a0everybody: not just the kind of\u00a0people who were\u00a0upset by\u00a0punk, but the\u00a0punks as well.\u00a0They meticulously documented the reactions, which means you can hear the audiences howling in anger and dismay at\u00a0their early\u00a0shows on the live box set TG24 and\u00a0the answering machine message from\u00a0the music journalist baldly threatening to kill them\u00a0on the 1978 album\u00a0track Death Threats. In fairness, if you deal in churning\u00a0grey noise topped off with lyrics about serial killers and concentration camps, you should probably expect people\u00a0to get upset, but there&apos;s a sense that the objection wasn&apos;t merely to what\u00a0Throbbing Gristle were doing, but to\u00a0their artistic background. Tutti says the band were unbothered by\u00a0their rockist critics: &quot;I didn&apos;t even think\u00a0about them to be honest, anybody else just didn&apos;t cross my radar. Why would\u00a0I be interested in what the rock world thought about me?&quot; Besides, the animosity had a positive effect. Ignored or\u00a0vilified, Throbbing Gristle were forced\u00a0to carve out their own niche, with lasting effects both on music \u2013 singlehandedly inventing a genre, industrial, that endures to this day \u2013 and the music industry. &quot;We thought it would be fun to see how their business model worked, how we could subvert it, which we did. Rough Trade kind of came off the back of\u00a0our label, Industrial Records. The whole\u00a0independent scene kind of fell into\u00a0place after that.&quot; Thirty-five years later, a musician spawned by performance art is adored rather than despised. Lady Gaga describes\u00a0her appearance at the 2009 MTV\u00a0Awards, during which she appeared to bleed to death from a gash on her stomach while singing Paparazzi as &quot;a performance art piece that re-enacted the death of celebrity in front of all America&quot;. Cosey Fanni Tutti \u2013 not a fan \u2013 probably wouldn&apos;t thank you for pointing it out, but\u00a0it doesn&apos;t seem too distant from Coum\u00a0Transmissions&apos; 70s experiments with fake blood and wounds and simulated\u00a0suicides. Gaga&apos;s interest in performance art seems to have had an unexpected effect on the mainstream audience: when she mentioned Abramovic\u00a0in an interview, the artist says, her Moma retrospective was suddenly flooded with &quot;this enormous audience of kids between 12 and 18 spending hours there&quot;. Abramovic adds: &quot;She&apos;s really a phenomenon. With the costumes, the blood, everything, she&apos;s really looking to art, and she&apos;s generous enough to say where the interest is coming from, which Madonna will never do.&quot; It could be that Lady Gaga has lured a mainstream audience with some pretty straightforward pop music, but there&apos;s always the chance her success indicates a\u00a0shift in the mainstream audience&apos;s perception of performance art. Ono thinks that could be down to the cumulative effect of her forebears: &quot;I think what we were doing was kind of a like a stepping stone, on a subconscious level. Maybe it was the preparation. This is happening now on a very big level.&quot; Back in Taiwan, Lady Gaga is musing on\u00a0her success in balancing pop with performance art. No, she says, she never worries that the spectacle of the latter detracts from the former. &quot;I&apos;m both. I&apos;m\u00a0musician and pop singer and performance artist. I could conversely argue to you that sometimes the music takes away from the performance art,&quot; she\u00a0laughs, and heads off, to perform a gig\u00a0in\u00a0front of 44,000 people. \u2022 The Life and Death of Marina Abramovic runs from 9-16 July at the Lowry as part of the Manchester International Festival: mif.co.uk"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2011/jul/08/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2011-07-08T07:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology"], "sentences": ["China-based white-box vendors expected to ship 8 million tablet PCs in 2011 &gt;&gt; Digitimes&quot;China-based white-box vendors have launched many models of low-price tablet PCs mainly equipped with inexpensive ARM processors developed by Qualcomm, Nvidia and VIA Technologies for domestic sale and exports to emerging markets, with total shipments estimated at 2m units for the first quarter of 2011 and expected to reach 8m for the year, according to sources from Taiwan-based makers."], "title": "Boot up: 1-Click patent rejected, more open data, why Ballmer is at CES and more", "article": "A burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Nice try, Amazon: &apos;One-click&apos; payment too obvious to patent &gt;&gt; The Register&quot;A payment system devised by online retail giant Amazon is too obvious to patent, the European Patent Office (EPO) has ruled. &quot;Amazon had hoped to patent the way its customers pay for products through the click of a single webpage button.

Tensions have mounted in this normally staid state, often called &quot;Moderate Malaysia&quot;, after a group of 62 non-governmental organisations known locally as Bersih 2.0 proposed a peaceful protest, dubbed the &quot;Walk for Democracy&quot;, against alleged vote-rigging and other electoral abuses in a recent state election. But the government last week declared Bersih \u2013 which means &quot;clean&quot; in Malay \u2013 illegal, and has warned that anyone wearing the yellow colours of protest will be detained. It has already arrested more than 200 supporters and organisers on charges ranging from the promotion of &quot;illegal assembly&quot; to &quot;waging war against the king&quot;. Some are being held for an indefinite period without trial. Although Malaysia&apos;s next general election is not until 2013, polls could take place as soon as this year \u2013 with many speculating that the incumbent Barisan Nasional (National Front) may not fare so well. Headed by the prime minister, Najib Razak, Barisan Nasional has ruled Malaysia since 1955. It suffered a major setback in 2008 when it lost more than one-third of its parliamentary seats to Pakatan Rakyat (People&apos;s Alliance), a coalition of opposition parties. Despite government accusations that they are actively threatening national security, Bersih&apos;s leaders have been adamant that they are pushing solely for electoral changes. &quot;We are calling for a government through free and fair elections, not street demonstrations&quot; like in Egypt or Libya, said Bersih&apos;s chairwoman, Ambiga Sreenevasan. After calling Bersih illegal, the government assented to a rally in a stadium. Opposition groups expect as many as 300,000 supporters to turn out. Police, however, have refused to grant Bersih a permit for the rally \u2013 a requirement for any gathering of five or more people \u2013 and have said they will work with the army to disperse Saturday&apos;s crowds. Earlier this week police held a military exercise in which soldiers held up banners reading &quot;Disperse or we will shoot&quot;. Najib threw his endorsement behind local silat \u2013 or martial arts \u2013 groups, including one that has openly vowed to &quot;wage war&quot; against Bersih. &quot;If there are evil enemies who want to attack the country from without and within,&quot; Najib said this week, &quot;you, my brothers, will rise to fight them&quot;. Bersih organisers say they have received death, bomb and gang-rape threats in recent weeks, which they claim police have not investigated. &quot;It has been challenging personally,&quot; said Ambiga. Nonetheless, Bersih &quot;understand our responsibility in holding the line on behalf of all of you who want nothing more than a clean electoral system and a better Malaysia.&quot; While no one is entirely sure what to expect on Saturday, the lead-up has already caused mayhem. Extensive roadblocks have caused near standstills in Kuala Lumpur and many businesses will be closing. Widespread mobile phone and internet disruption is expected. Despite it being a supposedly peaceful protest, many are expecting violence. &quot;This is the formula now, all around the world \u2013 in Libya, Egypt, it&apos;s all the same \u2013 there will be violence,&quot; said Mohamed Rayak, 32, a hotel manager. &quot;But no one knows if it will be coming from the government or the opposition. If it&apos;s from the government, then they can say it all got out of hand, and [the rally] has to be stopped.&quot; Thousands of supporters have aired their views on Facebook and Twitter, with many of them, such as Thomas Chai, tweeting directly to the prime minister. &quot;Beneath this YELLOW there is an idea, Mr Najib, and ideas are bulletproof,&quot; he wrote. Bersih supporters in other parts of the world are expected to hold similar rallies on Saturday in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, France, Switzerland, the US, Canada and the UK."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/08/singapore-domestic-workers-rights", "publicationDate": "2011-07-08T15:31:15Z", "tags": ["Singapore", "World news", "Employment law", "Work-life balance", "Work & careers", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Mandatory rest days are already enshrined in employment law in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and it seems Singapore&apos;s domestic employers may soon have to follow suit in allowing their employees some relaxation time, says Edmund Pooh of Universal Employment Agency."], "title": "Singapore government urged to give maids the day off", "article": "If you&apos;re a domestic maid in Singapore, there&apos;s no such thing as the weekend. Since employers are not legally bound to grant days off, the weeks never end. In the country that officially works the longest hours in the world, where one in six families has domestic help, the legal right to a day off has long seemed unthinkable for maids. But a government minister&apos;s suggestion that a mandatory rest day could minimise stress has reignited a long-standing debate in Singapore over workers&apos; rights. Halimah Yacob, Singapore&apos;s minister for community development, health and sports, says domestic workers need one day a week to &quot;rest and recuperate&quot;. The government has said it is &quot;studying the suggestion&quot;. But no legal right to a day off isn&apos;t the only problem for Singapore&apos;s 201,000 domestic workers, for whom there is, perhaps not surprisingly, no minimum wage either. It&apos;s the attitudes of their employers \u2013 and indeed the country at large \u2013 that stands in the way of progress. &quot;Are maids really that overworked?&quot; asked schoolteacher Low Ai Choo, in a letter to the local Straits Times. &quot;My maid has a day off once a month. Every time she comes back from her outings she appears even more tired and listless, and needs to recuperate from her outing. &quot;My maid is the one who goes to bed by nine every night and my husband and I are the ones still up way beyond nine to tuck in our children and catch up with school work.&quot; Low is one of many employers reacting angrily to Yacob&apos;s suggestion, which came after the International Labour Organisation (ILO) agreed last week to give domestic workers a day off every week, as well as other basic labour rights. Singapore, along with the UK, was among 63 member states that abstained from the vote. For some domestic employers such as Choo, the real issue lies in Singapore&apos;s &quot;workhorse&quot; mentality, whereby everyone \u2013 not just maids \u2013 could do with more time to relax. Singaporeans work the longest hours in the world according to the ILO, clocking up an average of 46.6 hours a week. New parents often struggle with the work-life balance, as statutory maternity leave in Singapore is limited to 16 weeks and there is no right to paternity leave. In the UK new mothers can take up to 52 weeks&apos; maternity leave and fathers up to two weeks. Many domestic workers in Singapore are hired as live-in cooks, cleaners and nannies, and some agencies, such as Best Maid, capitalise on Singapore&apos;s strong work ethic. &quot;In Singapore, [a] maid is not a luxury, but a necessity,&quot; reads the company&apos;s website. But not everyone can afford domestic help. On top of the salary, employers are required to pay a \u00a32,500 security bond on their maid, as well as a monthly fee of around \u00a3135 throughout the standard two-year contract. Such rules can encourage employers to be less concerned about the welfare of their workers than &quot;getting value for money&quot;, says Vincent Wijeysingha of the charity Transient Workers Count Too. &quot;Unlike more liberal countries where your rights are protected by law, here it all comes down to the personal goodwill of the employer, he said. &quot;Many think, &apos;I already pay so much for her, I don&apos;t want to let her out of the house where she might find a boyfriend, get pregnant and make me lose my security bond.&apos;&quot; While physical abuse of domestic workers has decreased in recent years, psychological abuse is very common, says Bridget Tan of the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics, which counsels some 1,000 runaway domestic workers every year. &quot;Newcomers usually have their mobiles taken away, aren&apos;t allowed to communicate with family or neighbours and get no day off. The working conditions here are making people go crazy.&quot; Domestic helpers \u2013 nearly one-third of which come from the Philippines \u2013 work an average of 14 hours a day, with only 12% given one day off per week, according to a new report. Employers negotiate contracts directly with their workers, with many offering a monthly payment of around \u00a325 if no rest day is taken. Salaries range from around \u00a3125 to \u00a3350 a month, although many workers receive no pay for the first six to 11 months of their contract due to agency fees. Mandatory rest days are already enshrined in employment law in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and it seems Singapore&apos;s domestic employers may soon have to follow suit in allowing their employees some relaxation time, says Edmund Pooh of Universal Employment Agency. &quot;It will be difficult for them to attract good workers if they don&apos;t.&quot; For Filipina worker AJ, 40, who uses her weekly day off to attend computer classes and socialise with friends, more time to rest can only be a good thing. &quot;I came here for a better life \u2013 we all did,&quot; said the former agricultural worker. &quot;But you cannot work from 6am to 9pm every day with no rest and so little pay.

Keep in mind that people live in 24 different time zones, and some people are following on their iPhones. So let everyone play the game. Don&apos;t spoil it for everyone else by identifying the bird in the first 24 to 36 hours.2. If you know the bird&apos;s identity, provide subtle hints to let others know that you know. Your hints may be helpful as small clues to less experienced players. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones.4. Comments that spoil others&apos; enjoyment may be deleted. The Game: 1. This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too).2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone&apos;s enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all.4. Each bird species will be demystified approximately 48 hours after publication.  You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page.

So, in the early hours of Wednesday, Chris Weir broke the habit of a lifetime and cracked open a bottle of wine. &quot;I don&apos;t even drink, so that shows you how excited we were,&quot; said Weir, 55, a former psychiatric nurse, as she and her husband, Colin, 64, revealed themselves as the UK&apos;s biggest ever lottery winners with Tuesday&apos;s EuroMillions jackpot of \u00a3161m safe in their bank. Initially, they had not wanted to go public with their win. But they realised that they would have had to tell lies and hide their news from those around them, and they wanted to be able to enjoy the moment and all that it meant. &quot;We are not flashy people,&quot; said Chris. &quot;We are not celebrities and we hope that once we have shared our good news we will get some time to go back to being us.&quot; The retired couple from Largs, in Ayrshire, now better off than the Marquess of Bath, and just a few million short of David and Victoria Beckham&apos;s vast fortune, said they were still struggling to come to terms with their newfound wealth but were not daunted by it. &quot;We are not afraid of this,&quot; said Chris. &quot;It seems mammoth; it seems absolutely fantastical. When I woke up on Tuesday morning everything was ordinary. I woke up on Wednesday morning and the whole world was totally different for us \u2026 We&apos;re not scared of it. It&apos;s going to be fantastic and it&apos;s going to be so much fun.&quot; The Weirs&apos; \u00a3161m prize, the biggest ever in the EuroMillions draw, came after a series of rollovers. The previous biggest winner, also from the UK, scooped \u00a3113m in October and chose to stay anonymous. The prize is 50% more than the amount Scotland collects in taxes every month and equivalent to 0.16% of Scotland&apos;s GDP. Married for 30 years, the Weirs have both suffered from ill-health and appeared in front of the press yesterday at a hotel near Falkirk walking with the aid of sticks. For many years, Colin was a carer for his wife. Their two adult children, Carly, 24, a photography student, and Jamie, 22, who works at a call centre, were also stunned by the win. Unable until now to afford their own cars, both offspring have signed up for driving lessons. The Weirs plan to buy their children homes, and Chris will replace her Suzuki car. Colin, however, is happy with his old car because it is reliable and he does not see the need for a new one. A keen football fan who follows Barcelona, he may see fit to get a box at the Camp Nou stadium to watch his team play. They plan to travel. The Great Wall of China, Uluru \u2013 formerly Ayers Rock \u2013 in Australia, Cambodia and Taiwan are first on their list. They like their three-bedroom villa in Largs with its nice views, so have no immediate plans to move, but would consider a second or maybe even third home.

The landmark deal between Baidu, China&apos;s version of Google, and three of the world&apos;s largest record labels ends a six-year legal battle about &quot;notorious&quot; piracy in the world&apos;s most populous country. Under the terms of the deal, Sony, Universal Music and Warner Music will receive an undisclosed fee every time one of Baidu&apos;s millions of users downloads or streams a track online. The deal comes after the record labels and US officials accused Baidu \u2013 which is by far China&apos;s biggest search engine handling almost 80% of the country&apos;s internet traffic \u2013 of &quot;deep linking&quot; customers to third-party sites that host pirated music. The US trade representative accused Baidu of providing a &quot;notorious market&quot; sustaining piracy in the world&apos;s largest internet market. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry estimates that at present 99% of online music in China is pirated. The rampant piracy has made it very difficult for music and film companies to make money in China. The global music industry collected $75m (\u00a347m) in China in 2009 compared with $4.6bn in the United States, according to the IFPI. Frances Moore, chief executive of the IFPI, said Tuesday&apos;s deal was an &quot;important step forward&quot;. Under the two-year deal between Baidu and One-Stop China, which represents the three record labels, more than 500,000 songs will be stored on Baidu&apos;s server and made available to stream or download. The companies refused to state how much money the labels will collect from each download. The labels will also collect a share of associated advertising. The deal, which requires Baidu to remove its links to sites carrying pirated material, ends a legal case pending at Beijing&apos;s Higher People&apos;s Court. Jennifer Li, Baidu&apos;s finance director, said: &quot;Baidu, the Chinese music fans, recording artists and the record companies will all benefit from this win-win partnership.&quot; Kaiser Kuo, Baidu&apos;s director of international communications, said: &quot;We&apos;ve never wanted to stand there and thumb our noses at the recording industry. This is a watershed moment. It&apos;s a great way for us to deliver the best possible user experience by providing free and high-quality music and brings obvious tangible benefits to all parties involved including the label, artists and advertisers&quot;. Dick Wei, an analyst at JP Morgan, said: &quot;[The deal] will be very positive for Baidu in terms of user experience and it also fits in with Baidu&apos;s box computing strategy, which is to make a lot of information available on the Baidu site.&quot; About 10% of the songs will be in Mandarin or Cantonese. Baidu&apos;s shares, trading on the Nasdaq in New York, have more than tripled since Google&apos;s partial withdrawal from China in January after a dispute about government censorship in the country. Earlier this month Baidu signed a deal with Microsoft to provide English-language search results, but they will be censored to meet the Chinese government&apos;s demands regarding controversial subjects, such as political dissidents, Taiwan and pornography."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/19/today-maoism-speaks-to-the-poor", "publicationDate": "2011-07-19T18:33:00Z", "tags": ["India", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["In the last century alone, millions died due to political conflict or hunger and were brutally dispossessed and culturally deracinated in a huge area of Asian territory, from Turkey and Iran to Indonesia and Taiwan."], "title": "Maoism may have faded in China, but\u00a0it still speaks to the world's poor | Pankaj Mishra", "article": "In 2008 in Beijing I met the Chinese novelist Yu Hua shortly after he had returned from Nepal, where revolutionaries inspired by Mao Zedong had overthrown a monarchy. A young Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution, Yu Hua, like many Chinese of his generation, has extremely complicated views on Mao. Still, he was astonished, he told me, to see Nepalese Maoists singing songs from his Maoist youth \u2013 sentiments he never expected to hear again in his lifetime.     Illustration by Otto    In fact, the success of Nepalese Maoists is only one sign of the &quot;return&quot; of Mao. In central India armed groups proudly calling themselves Maoists control a broad swath of territory, fiercely resisting the Indian government&apos;s attempts to make the region&apos;s resource-rich forests safe for the mining operations that, according to a recent report in Foreign Policy magazine, &quot;major global companies like Toyota and Coca-Cola&quot; now rely on. And \u2013 as though not to be outdone by Mao&apos;s foreign admirers \u2013 some Chinese have begun to carefully deploy Mao&apos;s still deeply ambiguous memory in China. Texting Mao&apos;s sayings to mobile phones, broadcasting &quot;Red&quot; songs from state-owned radio and television, and sending college students to the countryside, Bo Xilai, the ambitious communist party chief of the southwestern municipality of Chongqing, is leading an unexpected Mao revival in China. It was the &quot;return&quot; of Marx, rather than of Mao, that was much heralded in academic and journalistic circles after the financial crisis of 2008. And it is true that Marxist theorists, rather than Marx himself, clearly anticipated the problems of excessive capital accumulation, and saw how eager and opportunistic investors cause wildly uneven development across regions and nations, enriching a few and impoverishing many others. But Mao&apos;s &quot;Sinified&quot; and practical Marxism, which includes a blueprint for armed rebellion, appears to speak more directly to many people in poor countries. It is tempting to denounce Mao as a monster, and to dismiss the Maoists of today as no less criminally deluded than Peru&apos;s Shining Path guerillas, or the Khmer Rouge. Certainly, the scale of the violence Mao inflicted on China dwarfs all other crimes and disasters committed during the course of nation-building in the last two centuries. But political and economic modernisers elsewhere also exacted a terrible human cost from their allegedly backward peoples. In the last century alone, millions died due to political conflict or hunger and were brutally dispossessed and culturally deracinated in a huge area of Asian territory, from Turkey and Iran to Indonesia and Taiwan. Every nation state whitewashes the abominations of its founders. The influence, however, of the earliest postcolonial nation-builders is severely limited today. Hardly anyone looks up Sukarno&apos;s Pancasila for political guidance, or derive inspiration, as Nasser and Jinnah once did, from Ataturk&apos;s republican nationalism. So denunciations of Mao don&apos;t go very far in explaining his enduring appeal inside and outside China. That said, there seems little mystery to the invocation of Mao by a new generation of Chinese leaders, who recently also tapped into Confucius as a source of ideological legitimacy. The recourse to Mao is an example of the expedient populism that insecure ruling classes resort to. As an icon of the new China, Mao seems as bland as the basketball player Yao Ming and the French Open tennis champion Li Na. But for many people outside China there is another, much more dangerous, Mao \u2013 and he isn&apos;t the rash instigator of the Great Leap Forward or the cynical perpetrator of the Cultural Revolution, either. For\u00a0them, as Yu Hua writes in a forthcoming book, &quot;what Mao did in China is not so important \u2013 what matters is that his ideas retain their vitality and, like seeds planted in receptive soil, &apos;strike root, flower, and bear fruit&apos;.&quot; Mao set out these portable ideas well before his disastrous reign as quasi-emperor of China. Indeed, his diagnosis of, and proposed cure for, China&apos;s pre-revolutionary maladies in such tracts as &quot;Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan&quot; (1927), &quot;On Guerrilla Warfare&quot; (1937) and &quot;On Protracted War&quot; (1938) were what gave him his decisive advantage over his many Chinese rivals. Early in his career he identified a nexus between feudal elites in the hinterland and capitalists in the semi-colonial coastal cities as the enemy, and then successfully mobilised a &quot;people&apos;s&quot; army to break it. Mao&apos;s theory and praxis was always likely to have greater appeal than classical, urban-oriented Marxism in many agrarian countries, where tiny elites held down, often with foreign assistance, a population consisting largely of peasants. Nearly half a century ago, nationalist groups in Vietnam and Cuba successfully realised Mao&apos;s strategy of encircling the cities from the countryside. Now it is economic globalisers, encircling the countryside from the cities, who provide a freshly receptive soil for Mao&apos;s theory and praxis. Far\u00a0from being rendered irrelevant, they have become attractive again to many people who feel\u00a0actively victimised rather than\u00a0simply &quot;left behind&quot; by an expansionist capitalism. A case in point is the Maoist insurgency in the forests of central India, which feeds on the Indian government&apos;s ruthless drive to open up the region&apos;s great mineral reserves to private and multinational corporations. Indian Maoists mouthing Mao Zedong&apos;s rhetoric about local &quot;compradors&quot; and foreign imperialists may appear to be pathetic dead-enders to those who imagine everyone will at some point settle down to loving liberal democracy and the iPad. But the Maoists, though often corrupt and brutal, have found a large constituency among millions of indigenous peoples (Adivasis), for whom even the fragile security of a subsistence economy has been destroyed by the nexus between global corporations and their Indian enforcers. The Indian writer Shashank Kela points to a crucial fact about Indian Maoism and its Adivasi rank and file: &quot;It is the circumstances of their lives rather than its ideology that push its followers into a desperate, last-ditch battle with the state in preference to dispossession.&quot; As Kela writes, &quot;mining and heavy industry displaced Adivasi communities, destroyed their livelihoods, failed to give them jobs and cut them loose to join the swelling workforce of migrant labourers, a sea of impoverished, overworked human beings, reduced to accepting the worst-paid jobs in city and countryside&quot;. It is far from clear how the Maoist insurgency, and its attempted suppression by Indian paramilitaries, who have claimed more than 10,000 lives in the past decade, will end. After their overthrow of the monarchial state, Nepal&apos;s Maoists went on to participate in elections. Indian Maoists are unlikely to give up armed resistance any time soon. And the Indian state may find it impossible to suppress them militarily. That the benefits of economic globalisation will abruptly start flowing to its biggest victims is even less conceivable in the forests of central India than in the post-industrial cities of midwestern America. &quot;There is not the slightest chance,&quot; Kela writes of the Maoist Adivasis, one of the peoples rendered superfluous by industrial capitalism, &quot;that they will ever become a factory proletariat&quot;. A long and bloody stalemate beckons; and, while Maoism may be reduced to near-meaninglessness as state doctrine in China, it seems certain that many corners of the world are likely to remain Maoist for a very long time."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/20/general-john-allen-pass-notes", "publicationDate": "2011-07-20T18:59:01Z", "tags": ["Nato", "Afghanistan", "US military", "US news", "World news", "South and Central Asia"], "sentences": ["He&apos;s also received four Legion of Merit awards, the Mongolian Meritorious Service Medal and the Taiwan Order of the Resplendent Banner (with special cravat)."], "title": "Pass notes No 3,013: General John R Allen", "article": "Age: Mid-50s.

Christie&apos;s, the global auction house, has disclosed record first-half sales of \u00a32bn, up 15% on the same time last year, including the sale of an Andy Warhol self-portrait for over \u00a323m. Jussi Pylkkanen, Christie&apos;s president for Europe, said: &quot;At times of financial weakness, there is a flight towards quality, as people seek out security and real value that reside within works of art.&quot; But the trend is underwritten by an increasing number of wealthy people who are prepared to invest in art at a time when investors are more culturally savvy than ever before. Pylkkanen said Christie&apos;s trading volumes had tripled since 2001, while prices were rising because of &quot;a willingness by the global rich to compete for works of art. All this means demand is on an upwards trajectory.&quot; Top-selling works of art in the first six months of 2011 included Pablo Picasso&apos;s Femme Assise, Robe Bleue, which fetched nearly \u00a318m, and Francis Bacon, Study for a Portrait, 1953, which went for \u00a317.9m. Christie&apos;s says the art market remains healthy at &quot;all price levels&quot; and that 19% of clients now bid online. While auction sales rose 10%, there was a 57% jump in private sales, where the company matches buyers with potential sellers. Sales in Asia showed the strongest growth, up 48% at nearly \u00a3300m. Buyers from greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, continued to be the largest buyers of wine and Asian art globally. There was also a significant increase in spending from Middle Eastern buyers on Christie&apos;s jewels and watches. The biggest market was the UK and continental Europe, where sales rose 24% to \u00a3803m. America was down 13% at \u00a3578m because fewer big collections were put up for auction than a year ago. Pylkkanen denied the US market was showing signs of weakness. He adds: &quot;Christie&apos;s sales worldwide continue to increase across all categories as the global art market continues to expand. Record results in Hong Kong reaffirm it as a growing global art hub and Asia as the fastest-growing art market in the world.&quot; Highlights for the second half of the year include an auction of the late Elizabeth Taylor&apos;s jewellery and paintings at the Rockefeller Centre in New York in December. Pylkkanen said the company&apos;s second Green Auction in New York was a success in terms of the $2.4m (\u00a31.5m) that it raised for the environment, &quot;and its ability to convene artists, business leaders, celebrities, environmentalists and leading families of the 21st century around the world, all committed to a common cause.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/26/rupert-murdoch-wrong-singapore", "publicationDate": "2011-07-26T07:00:01Z", "tags": ["Singapore", "World news", "Rupert Murdoch", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The Global Wage Report 2009, a study by the International Labor Organisation, found that among 13 countries surveyed (Singapore, Cyprus, Japan, South Korea, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand, Canada, Taiwan, Denmark, Spain, UK, and US) Singaporeans worked the most hours."], "title": "Singapore is not so clean, Mr Murdoch | Chee Soon Juan", "article": "Letchmi (not her real name), a 40-year-old Singaporean woman, stood in the dock and pleaded guilty to pilfering $743 from the cash register where she worked as a cashier at a local supermarket.

She had returned all the money that she had stolen. Unmoved, the prosecution pushed for a deterrent sentence. The judge imposed a fine of $2,000.

If ministers need to be paid the amounts that they are in Singapore to prevent corruption, which is a criminal act, why can&apos;t we pay people like Letchmi enough to sustain her livelihood and health so that she doesn&apos;t resort to stealing? The Global Wage Report 2009, a study by the International Labor Organisation, found that among 13 countries surveyed (Singapore, Cyprus, Japan, South Korea, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand, Canada, Taiwan, Denmark, Spain, UK, and US) Singaporeans worked the most hours. Yet they saw their real wages decline. There is no minimum wage in Singapore. Prices and Earnings, a 2010 survey conducted by UBS, revealed that Singapore was the 11th most expensive city in the world out of 73. In that same study, it was found that the domestic purchasing power of Singaporeans was ranked at 49th. One of the most expensive cities in the world with its inhabitants paid poorly: are these not factors that drive workers like Letchmi to committing criminal acts? Even the elderly in Singapore are not spared. They are pushed to work way into their retirement years, and for less pay. It is a common sight to witness folks in their 70s, doubled over from old age, working as cleaners at public toilets and food centres in Singapore. And yet Singapore&apos;s government ministers defend their enormous salaries by making the case that if they are not paid more than excessively they will be tempted by corruption, an argument that now finds an adherent in Murdoch. In addition, the &quot;open&quot; system that Murdoch claims exists in Singapore is more a figment of his imagination. Let&apos;s start with the media. In the 1960s and 70s, many journalists were imprisoned. Independently owned newspapers were shut down. Today all Singaporean publications, TV channels and radio stations are owned and run by the government. Civil society is nonexistent. Non-government organisations, student bodies and trade unions are tightly controlled. Public assemblies outside a small and demarcated area are banned. The opposition is in a moribund state. Many of its leaders have been arrested and detained without trial, prosecuted in court, and sued till bankruptcy for defamation. The election system is far from free and fair. The &quot;election&quot; of the country&apos;s president to be held in a few weeks&apos; time, for example, is restricted to a handful of candidates allowed by the prime minister. Political power amassed in the hands of the few in Singapore is also used to ensure that a disproportionate amount of financial power is accumulated in those same hands. Officials who seek authority as custodians of political power must have the character to keep away from crime no matter what the temptation might be. The argument that ministers should be paid millions of dollars to keep them from corruption does not hold water. No one denies those in charge of government should be paid well. But when politicians start to climb on to pedestals and insist that they be rewarded with stratospheric levels of remuneration, it raises serious questions of moral leadership. Public service enriches one&apos;s sense of loyalty and mission, not one&apos;s bank account. There are other vocations if one&apos;s goal is to amass financial fortunes. Public service and greed don&apos;t mix well. Perhaps Murdoch is just beginning to find this out himself."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/jul/26/consider-sushi", "publicationDate": "2011-07-26T08:40:00Z", "tags": ["Japanese food and drink", "Fish", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Seafood"], "sentences": ["You can still eat this historic form of sushi near Kyoto and in Thailand and Taiwan.Much later people started to eat the sour fermented rice with the fish, and as roads improved, all fish could be eaten fresher."], "title": "Consider sushi", "article": "The rise of sushi around the world is one of most interesting stories in food. It combines the meshing of cultures, the emancipation of women, groundswells in technology and rampant and conflicted globalisation. The first Indian menu in London was muted and truncated for its 19th-century clientele, and most Indian food here, like Chinese, bears scant relation to its original. America&apos;s earliest sushi customers were Japanese, so the modern sushi movement \u2013 whatever its subsequent corruptions \u2013 was far more authentic and intriguing. That movement is very young, as should be obvious from a moment&apos;s thought. To have a sushi restaurant you either need to live very close to the sea, as many Japanese people do, or you need sophisticated systems of transport and refrigeration that can jet iced bluefin around the planet. Japan&apos;s original sushi \u2013 cobbled, like its architecture, writing, chopsticks and much else, from the mainland \u2013 was in fact a method of preservation.  Trevor Corson writes in his slow but earnest The Story of Sushi that people living along the Mekong river a few thousand years ago would pack cleaned, gutted fish in jars with cooked rice. The rice fermented into alcohol and acids and kept the fish edible for up to a year. You can still eat this historic form of sushi near Kyoto and in Thailand and Taiwan.Much later people started to eat the sour fermented rice with the fish, and as roads improved, all fish could be eaten fresher. Rice vinegar appeared around 1600AD, allowing people to bring to rice many of the flavours it had previously only acquired from fermentation. By the 1800s, then, Japanese people were eating fresh raw fish paired with rice that had been flavoured with sugar, salt and rice vinegar \u2013 modern sushi. Little Tokyo in Los Angeles had had Japanese restaurants since the 1850s, but it wasn&apos;t until Osho opened near Beverly Hills in 1970 that the Americans began to embrace sushi. The new food was low-fat, high-protein and expensive \u2013 perfectly suited to Hollywood. Osho was next door to Twentieth Century Fox&apos;s studios, and that old scowler Yul Brynner soon became a regular.  More recently, a partnership between Robert De Niro and Nobu Matsuhisa has led to a scattering of beautiful and costly Japanese-themed restaurants around the world. When I met Nobusan last week he showed me his latest idea: a DIY sushi box with the ingredients already prepped, a sensible move as, by far the hardest thing about making sushi is acquiring the knife skills. At whatever cost to quality, modern sushi restaurants broke down the rigid hierarchies of Japanese kitchens, where trainees spend perhaps three years on the rice before they touch any fish. More importantly, the food was at last opened to women. Japanese sushi restaurants are sexist to an extent that would appal most westerners. The traditional ones discourage single women from dining in them altogether. They have almost no female chefs: Corson writes that male sushi chefs often believe &quot;makeup, body lotion, and perfume destroy the flavor of the fish and rice&quot;.  Until 1999 it was illegal for women in Japan to work after 10pm, which made employment in the restaurant industry almost impossible. And an idiotic belief persists that women have warmer hands than men and thus might somehow the spoil fish by handling it. We actually know the reverse is true. One of the many advantages of sushi spreading around the world is that women have been allowed to share in it properly. The classic sushi item is arguably the nigiri, which comes from a word meaning to squeeze. It&apos;s the familiar cuboid of lightly packed rice with perhaps a little wasabi and a strip of fish sitting on top. Maki are sliced logs of rice-wrapped fillings held together by strips of nori seaweed. Temaki are nori rolls shaped like ice cream cones, and gunkan is the name for those little cups often filled with salmon roe. I list the names because traditional Japanese food can at first seem difficult and intimidating. To learn about it is to enter a complex and unwelcoming system of rules, codes and shibboleths. The etiquette of sushi-eating, indeed of all Japanese food, is so complicated that the gaijin Trevor Corson devotes several pages to it at the back of his book. It&apos;s an unspeakable faux pas to pay the chef directly, to ask for a menu or a spoon for your soup, and countless other arbitrary edicts. Gari, the delicious pickled ginger that accompanies sushi should, it is said, only be used as a palate cleanser between different types of fish. Most Japanese people eat nigiri with their hands. Americans mix wasabi (which is really just horseradish powder and green food colouring) into their soy, a practice viewed with horror by most sushi chefs. Some Japanese table manners have specific cultural significance: the law against passing food using the thin end of one&apos;s chopsticks echoes the Shinto tradition of picking through the bones of the dead at funerals. But so much etiquette, as with codes of wine drinking and matching, is based on an inferiority complex and designed to exclude. It&apos;s best skimmed, selected from and mostly discarded. Tuna&apos;s popularity in sushi is a recent thing: in the 19th century, according to Sasha Issenberg&apos;s excellent book on the subject, the Japanese saw it as an inferior fish. The country&apos;s airlines promoted it in the 1960s as a way of filling return cargo flights that had brought electronics and other Japanese goods to the States. So began the infamous annihilation of this fish and the shameful reluctance of the Japanese to stem its destruction.  In 2008 Japan finally agreed to reduce its catch by about 5%, but the country was delighted when an attempted ban on bluefin fishing failed. Nobu&apos;s managing partner has claimed that Japanese chefs have prevented the removal of bluefin from the chain&apos;s menus.  Everyone seems to slag off Yo! Sushi! these days, but the chain helped to democratise and demystify an unfamiliar food. I rate it: I like its gimmicks and garishness, and the stuff you actually order is usually OK. Its clever business model is in part to blame for the tapasy small plates you see everywhere these days. The worst sushi comes from a fridge: at Pret, say, or Tesco or Boots. Hard claggy rice, brown avocado and a mushy, stinking crabstick have nothing to do with enjoyment. But as this food becomes mainstream, like burgers and pizza it will surely be cost-cut, mistreated and sullied for the profit of shareholders. As the stocks dwindle and the chains expand, we may look back on this time as the golden age of sushi."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/26/asian-ngos-tzu-chi-nunns", "publicationDate": "2011-07-26T13:00:52Z", "tags": ["Charities", "Taiwan", "Global development", "Aid", "Voluntary sector", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["And I&apos;ve been with them ever since,&quot; says the full-time volunteer for Taiwan-based NGO Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation.", "&quot;We have over 70,000 volunteers just in Taiwan,&quot; says Yeh.", "But it&apos;s not the only reason Tzu Chi&apos;s Taiwan branch was able to hand out a record $320m in 2010.", "&quot;We were the first company in Taiwan to use this technology, and we get to clean up the environment, lessen our dependence on petroleum and make our own blankets with this single process,&quot; says Larry Lee, who gave up a lucrative career in IT to run Da Ai.", "That&apos;s our motto.&quot; While economic growth plays a large role in allowing Asian NGOs to venture abroad, what Japan, Korea and Taiwan also have in common are stable democracies and high levels of education, technology use and access to information.", "After all, it wasn&apos;t too long ago that the 73-year-old Master Cheng Yen was relatively unknown outside of Taiwan."], "title": "Asian NGOs, awash with cash, ride a wave of economic growth", "article": "  Yeh Ci-xing wasn&apos;t expecting a tectonic shift in her core values or the genesis of major lifestyle changes after picking up an in-flight magazine. They aren&apos;t intended for that. What they did contain, particularly in 1988, were pithy distractions from the boredom, bad food, and secondhand smoke-filled cabins that were the hallmarks of long-haul flights. &quot;I was so moved by an article about Tzu Chi that I signed up within a few days of touching down in Taipei. And I&apos;ve been with them ever since,&quot; says the full-time volunteer for Taiwan-based NGO Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation. &quot;I&apos;ve learned to expect the unexpected.&quot; And so have millions of others. In the 45 years since it chiselled out a home for itself in the mountainous eastern province of Hualien, Tzu Chi has grown from a group of 30 housewives, led by the charismatic female Buddhist Master Cheng Yen, to Asia&apos;s largest charitable NGO. Today the foundation has branches in 52 countries. It can call on more than seven million members and donors worldwide, and has provided humanitarian relief in 72 countries. But Tzu Chi is far from the only Asian NGO to be expanding its work. The continent is booming in economic terms, and many of the north-east Asian-based NGOs in particular are reaping the benefits. Not only has donor funding surged over the last decade, but the number of Asian aid organisations seeking out development opportunities overseas has also grown rapidly. Lee Kyung-shin, a spokesman for the South Korean umbrella group Korea NGO Council for Overseas Cooperation, explains. &quot;From 2000, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of local NGOs that are working overseas,&quot; she says. &quot;Local economic development shares a symbiotic relationship with the growth of NGOs, and it has been crucial in allowing them to spend more on marketing and increasing public awareness on the need for development.&quot; By mirroring many of the region&apos;s corporate successes, a host of home-grown civil society groups have been applying what works in business to charitable causes. Much like the low-end manufacturing models that were the drivers of regional economic growth, there has been a push to slash the sort of administration and salary expenditures that cause concern to many western donors. The use of volunteers as opposed to hired staff and the introduction of business practices to charities are also helping to buttress record Asia-wide philanthropy. &quot;We have over 70,000 volunteers just in Taiwan,&quot; says Yeh. &quot;But what makes us a little different is that we pay our own way for everything. If we go on an aid mission overseas, we cover our own costs. The less we spend of Tzu Chi&apos;s money, the more we have to give to those who need it most.&quot; It is a concept that is drilled into volunteers as soon as they sign up for missions that extend from Burma to as far afield as Iraq and Haiti: spend less, use less, and give more. But it&apos;s not the only reason Tzu Chi&apos;s Taiwan branch was able to hand out a record $320m in 2010. The foundation has also opened businesses that put profits back into development coffers. And some of them are ingenious. One such outfit, Da Ai Technology, operates more than 400 plastic bottle recycling points across the island. The bottles undergo a production process that turns the plastic into polyester yarn that is used to make the hundreds of thousands of blankets, scarves, socks and hats that Tzu Chi has handed out in disaster-struck areas. &quot;We were the first company in Taiwan to use this technology, and we get to clean up the environment, lessen our dependence on petroleum and make our own blankets with this single process,&quot; says Larry Lee, who gave up a lucrative career in IT to run Da Ai. &quot;Our energy savings from this method run at 66% and we can reduce our carbon footprint by about 30%.&quot; A similar model is used by Tokyo-based Peace Winds Japan, which has worked in about 20 post-conflict and disaster-stricken countries since its establishment in 1996. &quot;We run a coffee-growing programme in Timor-Leste. We set the farmers up and then buy from them at fairtrade prices,&quot; says chief operating officer Rika Yamamoto. &quot;After we sell the coffee on the internet, we plug the profits back into expanding the programme.&quot; Yamamoto, who says that Peace Winds has a volunteer to employee ratio of four to one, also places a premium on watching costs. &quot;While our overheads are low, we still try and keep all of our sourcing local. Hire local. Buy local. That&apos;s our motto.&quot; While economic growth plays a large role in allowing Asian NGOs to venture abroad, what Japan, Korea and Taiwan also have in common are stable democracies and high levels of education, technology use and access to information. It is easier to help your neighbour when you know what he needs and you have the means to do it. Amy Bartlett, global co-ordinator for Open Forum for CSO Development, which works to build a consensus for effective aid distribution, hopes that the rise of providers from outside North America and Europe will plug some of the donor gaps left over from 2008&apos;s global financial crisis. &quot;Western aid givers are really hurting at the moment from a combination of the conservative political climate and an increased demand to fulfil sustainable development roles,&quot; she says. Bartlett&apos;s concerns over shrinking government donor sentiment have been echoed by many in aid circles, and runaway US debt and European austerity measures have done little to allay those fears. But as Asia inches closer to assuming its role as the global economic engine, there are hopes that Asian philanthropy will more closely shadow the continent&apos;s democratic and economic gains. After all, it wasn&apos;t too long ago that the 73-year-old Master Cheng Yen was relatively unknown outside of Taiwan. Now, to some, she&apos;s an almost iconic figure. But it wasn&apos;t her religious work that put her on Time magazine&apos;s 2011 list of the world&apos;s 100 most influential people, or prompted the UN to issue a stamp to mark Tzu Chi&apos;s 45th anniversary earlier this year. The accolades are coming because she built Asia&apos;s largest NGO from scratch and is at the vanguard of a new charitable movement that reaps the benefits of Asia&apos;s economic success."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/28/north-korea-us-meetings-conflict-avoidance", "publicationDate": "2011-07-28T16:00:01Z", "tags": ["North Korea", "US news", "South Korea", "China", "World news", "US national security", "Japan", "Nuclear weapons", "Hillary Clinton", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Just how fragile the security situation is becoming was illustrated last month when two Chinese fighters crossed the unofficial line dividing the Taiwan Strait in hot pursuit of an American spy plane."], "title": "North Korea meetings with US reflect a cautious conflict avoidance", "article": "A high-level meeting between American and North Korean diplomats, the first such encounter for more than two years, got underway in New York on Thursday amid hopes that stalled six-party talks on eliminating Pyongyang&apos;s nuclear weapons may resume this autumn \u2013 and stark warnings that time is running out for a deal. Both sides expressed caution, with US officials describing the exchanges as &quot;exploratory&quot;. Speaking during an Asia visit earlier this week, secretary of state Hillary Clinton said there would be no softening of Washington&apos;s demand that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons in return for normalised relations, energy assistance and security guarantees. North Korea&apos;s vice foreign minister Kim Kye-gwan said he was &quot;optimistic&quot; the six-party talks would be revived. &quot;Now is the time for countries to reconcile,&quot; he said. In a move timed to coincide with the New York meeting, Pyongyang reiterated its call for a treaty formally ending the 1950-53 Korean war. The resumed bilateral dialogue takes place against a backdrop of growing concern in South Korea and Japan that if North Korea cannot be persuaded to abandon its enrichment and other nuclear weapons-related activities, it may soon enter a more technologically advanced phase of its nuclear programme \u2013 meaning bigger, better bombs and longer-range ballistic missiles. &quot;Right now, North Korea may well be at a critical transitional moment in the development of its nuclear arsenal,&quot; said Joel Wit and Jenny Town, writing in Foreign Policy. &quot;Pyongyang has already completed the first phase of developing such an arsenal ... If [North Korea] is anything like other small nuclear powers, we can expect it to move on to building increasing numbers of more sophisticated nuclear weapons mounted on a variety of missile delivery systems.&quot; Reflecting this heightened sense of urgency, the US appears to be urging Seoul to move on from last year&apos;s sinking of a South Korean navy ship and a brief bombardment of its territory by the North. &quot;The US has definitely put some pressure on the South Korean government about beginning talks with North Korea,&quot; Hong Hyeon-ik, an analyst at Seoul&apos;s Sejong Institute, told the Washington Post. John Kerry, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, suggested recently the current stalemate could not be allowed to continue. &quot;Make no mistake: given North Korea&apos;s recent irresponsible conduct, staying in a diplomatic holding pattern invites a dangerous situation to get even worse,&quot; he said. But at the same time, other officials and analysts worry the US may concede too much in its effort to seal a deal. These concerns come in the context of broader anxiety that Washington&apos;s security guarantees for South Korea, dating back to the 1950s, are weakening as an overstretched, financially challenged US struggles to manage, or contain, the rise of an ever more militarily powerful and assertive China, North Korea&apos;s only important ally. To a greater or lesser degree, this anxiety about American commitment infects the region as a whole. &quot;Comments by influential South Koreans that their country should consider requesting the return of US nuclear weapons to their shores \u2013 or even acquire its own nuclear weapons \u2013 reflect persistent unease about how regional security developments are challenging US extended security guarantees developed during the cold war,&quot; said Richard Weitz, writing in The Diplomat. &quot;Although of less immediate concern to most South Koreans, the rising power of China has also been profoundly affecting regional security dynamics,&quot; Weitz said. &quot;In particular, China&apos;s growing military power has resulted in many east Asian countries deepening their security ties with the US and building up their defences, including by acquiring ballistic missile defences. In response, the Chinese have tightened their ties with North Korea, which, despite the headaches it causes, is a reliable buffer state.&quot; In short, it&apos;s plain any US proposal for a deal with North Korea must meet two basic criteria. On the one hand, it must be tough enough to reassure Seoul and other nervous allies that the nuclear and missile threat has been lifted. On the other hand, it must not be so tough as to scare off North Korea, push Beijing and Pyongyang closer together, and feed the claims of Chinese government hawks that Washington is bent on the strategic and military &quot;encirclement&quot; of China. In some ways, the North-South standoff resembles a much larger potential confrontation, between the US and China, which flickers episodically across the region from Vietnam to the Philippines and the East China Sea. Just how fragile the security situation is becoming was illustrated last month when two Chinese fighters crossed the unofficial line dividing the Taiwan Strait in hot pursuit of an American spy plane. No shots were fired.

Breivik sent the document to 1,003 email addresses less than an hour and half before he launched his attack with a huge bomb blast in Oslo. The Guardian has obtained the list of recipients, which includes members of the British National party and the English Defence League. There is no evidence that any of those who received the email knew Breivik or had any prior contact with him. Nick Lowles from Searchlight said: &quot;In the modern internet age people are less likely to join organisations but instead flit between groups, causes and campaigns with a much looser affiliation. This is what Breivik appears to have done. It is clear he read, digested and disseminated information on a wide range of neo-Nazi, nationalist and anti-Muslim forums. Breivik went down a terrorist path but he shared a common ideology and hatred with the likes of the BNP and EDL.&quot; On Norway&apos;s TV2 channel on Thursday night, Lowles added that Breivik appeared to have had online contact with extremists in Sweden. &quot;What we discovered was that at the end of 2008 Breivik was living in Sweden, and very much an actor in the far-right web debates,&quot; he said. &quot;It seems obvious from his many forum entries that it was here his political development took place, much more so than in his contacts with like-minded British extremists.&quot; In Norway detectives said they would interview Breivik again on Friday, but did not indicate what information they would be seeking from him. Breivik has confessed to the killings but claimed they were justified as part of a &quot;war&quot; and has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. Police have interviewed him once, in a seven-hour session the day after the attacks. A police lawyer, Paal-Fredrik Hjort Kraby, said Breivik, who is in solitary confinement, has no contact with the outside world apart from meetings with his lawyer and the police. Norway was &quot;getting back to normality&quot; and it was time to end restrictions on security, he added. He said there had been a number of bomb threats since the attacks but described them as unspecific, adding it was &quot;normal&quot; some people would seek to create more fear after such a tragedy.

Speaking at a company event, Gou said Foxconn already had 10,000 robots and would increase the number to 300,000 next year and a million within three. &quot;I don&apos;t think this is a one-off. Foxconn is often seen as a bellwether of global manufacturing in China,&quot; said Alistair Thornton of IHS Global Insight, suggesting other companies would follow suit. &quot;Workers can command higher wages and are less willing to settle for lower ones. You can no longer just double your workforce to double your output.&quot; Wages in the region have risen by around a third over the past year, experts estimate, as the proportion of young workers shrinks and their expectations rise. Manufacturers are seeking to improve productivity, or shift production inland or overseas, as Foxconn has already done, with huge new plants in Chengdu, Chongqing and Zhengzhou and one site in Vietnam. &quot;As labour costs rise, companies will have to invest more in automated facilities. But we shouldn&apos;t get carried away; there is still a lot of cheap labour out there,&quot; said Tom Miller, of Beijing-based economic consultancy GK-Dragonomics. Foxconn said last year it had overhauled conditions and more than doubled salaries at its vast plant in Longhua, Guangdong \u2014 from 900 to 2,000 yuan \u2014 after coming under fire over suicides by workers there. While many say wages and conditions are better than at other factories, some have complained about the tedium of the work and the strict regulations, which include silence on the assembly lines. One young migrant worker told the South China Morning Post last year: &quot;I feel like I have an empty life and work like a machine.&quot; Geoff Crothall, of China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based organisation supporting workers, said automation could be good news for employees. &quot;It&apos;s a positive development in that it will get rid of the really mind-numbing jobs that are done by unskilled workers and could help to improve skill levels. You still need people to manage and operate these machines,&quot; he said. &quot;The question is, how many people are going to be laid off and are they going to be reassigned?&quot; Others questioned whether the announcement was genuine. &quot;I am suspicious,&quot; said Liu Kaiming, of the Institute of Contemporary Observation, which supports workers in Guangdong. &quot;Machines can do it, but think about the cost \u2026 overall, workers are still much cheaper. This is probably just for sensational effect, [to] put pressure on workers.&quot; Prof Huang Renmin, director of the institute of labour market research at the China Institute of Industrial Relations, agreed. &quot;This is the trick capitalists use to threaten workers,&quot; he said. He said labour costs were going up partly because they had been suppressed for so long. China Daily reported last year that wages as a proportion of GDP fell every year between 1983 and 2005. In a statement, Foxconn Technology Group said Gou had been discussing his vision for the company. &quot;In that context, he said that the company is committed to continue increasing investments in R&amp;D, promoting innovation and increasing the use of automation in manufacturing and other operations over the next few years,&quot; the statement said. &quot;He said that the use of automation is driven by Foxconn&apos;s desire to move workers from more routine tasks to more value-added positions in manufacturing such as research and development, innovation and other areas,&quot; it added. It did not refer to labour costs or discuss how many robots would be involved. Foxconn reported a $218m loss last year, compared with a profit of $37m in 2009. But it said its first half loss had narrowed &quot;significantly&quot; this year in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing last month.

On the day that the monthly health check of manufacturing showed the sector sinking back into recession for the first time in two years, Ajai Chopra warned that ministers would need to be nimble if the economy performed less well than the IMF has been anticipating. Chopra, who led the IMF&apos;s mission to the UK for its annual assessment earlier this year, said the IMF still believed the UK was on course for a gradual recovery despite the headwinds caused by a soft housing market, George Osborne&apos;s budget measures and the desire of consumers to pay down debt. His remarks came, however, after the release of the July purchasing managers index (PMI) from Markit/CIPS startled the City by showing it had fallen for the sixth successive month and by far more than had been expected. The PMI dipped from 51.4 in June to 49.1 last month, below the cut-off point of 50 that separates expansion from contraction. Chopra said in a blog: &quot;The UK government should be nimble in its policy response if it looks as though the economy is headed for a prolonged period of weak growth, high unemployment and subdued inflation. &quot;Currently, we don&apos;t expect this to happen. But if such a scenario appears to be in prospect, we recommend responding quickly with some combination of further quantitative easing by the Bank of England and temporary tax cuts.&quot; Analysts in the City said a second dose of quantitative easing from the Bank of England looks more likely following the downbeat news from industry, where companies are starting to shed jobs in response to weakening domestic order books. Most agreed with Chopra&apos;s view that the UK was set for a &quot;choppy and bumpy&quot; recovery. Mark Lee, head of manufacturing at Barclays Corporate, said: &quot;Very weak domestic demand has effectively stalled any momentum that had built in the UK manufacturing sector over the past two years, with these new figures highlighting a worrying trend of destocking among manufacturers, as they seemingly prepare for further declines in orders. &quot;Manufacturers that export continue to see some upside in ongoing sterling weakness, but for those companies focused on the domestic market there is very little relief in sight at present.&quot; Figures released last week showed UK output growing by just 0.2% in the three months to June, and analysts said there were now doubts whether the pace would accelerate in the third quarter. Until recently, manufacturing had been a bright spot, helped by the pickup in world trade and the fall in the value of sterling. Richard Driver, analyst for Caxton FX, said: &quot;This manufacturing figure is alarmingly poor and really consolidates negative market sentiment towards the UK economy. The data undershot expectations considerably and represents the worst showing seen from the sector in over two years. This could represent the UK economy&apos;s first step back into recessionary territory; forward-looking data suggests that data is going to continue to get worse over coming months. &quot;These sorts of figures make further quantitative easing more likely than a Bank of England rate rise. To hike rates with UK growth at these sorts of levels would be self-destructive, regardless of high inflation.&quot; Britain was not the only country to see its manufacturing performance weaken last month, with the PMIs for the eurozone and US also recording sharp falls in activity. But George Buckley, UK chief economist at Deutsche Bank, said only Sweden, Australia, Switzerland, Israel and Taiwan had suffered a more pronounced decline in manufacturing this year than Britain, adding: &quot;In many of those cases this reflects the fact that they peaked at higher levels than the UK.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/02/foxconn-robots-worker-suicides", "publicationDate": "2011-08-02T17:52:33Z", "tags": ["Robots", "China", "Taiwan", "Apple", "Technology", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Foxconn"], "sentences": ["Now the Taiwanese company Foxconn, one of world&apos;s largest manufacturers of electronic products, such as the iPhone, is threatening to replace many of its million workers in China with robots."], "title": "Are Foxconn robots the answer to worker suicides? | Noel Sharkey", "article": "Is my lust for the iPhone and other cheaper electronics causing people to commit suicide? The three Ds of robotics are the Dull, Dangerous and Dirty work they take out of human hands. In the short term this could mean unemployment for the less skilled, with the touted benefit of more interesting and creative jobs on the horizon. Such has been the dilemma since the 19th-century luddite rage against the machines. Now the Taiwanese company Foxconn, one of world&apos;s largest manufacturers of electronic products, such as the iPhone, is threatening to replace many of its million workers in China with robots. It says it is to cut labour costs, but it comes in the wake of a spate of worker suicides last year. The media blamed harsh management practices, long working hours (12 hours a day) without break, and low wages. Undercover research by Sacom (Students &amp; Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour) claimed there were militaristic conditions inside the factories where employees have to sit in exact lines working intensively and are not allowed to speak. They reportedly fear the bullying of security guards and have to live in dormitories with strict rules. Ironically, some of the workers say that they are made to feel like robots. Foxconn, which insists that it is a responsible employer, has expressed sorrow over the deaths and called in experts for advice on preventing further suicides. But if half the reports are to be believed, there are clearly serious ethical questions to be asked. If people are being deprived of their rights to wellbeing and dignity and a number are throwing themselves off the roofs of the factories, would it not be better to be replaced by robots? A similar ethical dilemma emerged for the sweatshops that several major clothing companies were using. When the public boycotted them into submission, some asked if the unskilled workers were better off now without jobs or income. Again, in the short-term the answer has to be &quot;no&quot; but in the long run, there will be better working conditions for everyone. This may not be much compensation if you are starving. In the case of Foxconn, the threat of replacing workers with robots is not the real moral issue at stake here. Yes, we do have to ensure that our lives are not degraded by technology, but we must not let old arguments about &quot;technology creating unemployment&quot; be a smokescreen for the real issues. It is the responsibility of the large corporations to ensure that the companies making their electronics abide by similar practices as in their home countries. And it is the responsibility of all of us not to buy goods made by workers who are stripped of their rights and dignity. Let us not sweep our guilt under the technological carpet and blame the robots for failures of society to provide fair jobs. It is difficult to prove that technology reduces overall levels of employment. The pervasiveness of the computer removed many mundane tasks from our lives and created new job descriptions \u2013 secretarial work, for example, will never be the same. It also takes a lot of people to develop and make robots, never mind the numbers needed to operate, maintain and repair them. Despite my love of robots since childhood \u2013 as the high point of technology and for the technological challenges they present \u2013 we must remain vigilant about how they are helping us. If it turns out they are making our lives worse, I will be first in the luddite line with my sledgehammer."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/03/china-calls-us-debt-manage", "publicationDate": "2011-08-03T05:45:36Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "US news", "Economics", "Global economy", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Japan&apos;s Nikkei 225 tumbled 2.1% to 9,642.86 and markets in Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia, Taiwan, India, Singapore, the Philippines and Indonesia also dropped."], "title": "China calls on US to manage its debt 'responsibly' from now on", "article": "The governor of China&apos;s central bank has urged the US to take &quot;responsible&quot; measures to deal with its debt issues, warning that uncertainty could damage global growth, in the country&apos;s first official response to the bill.

The report, by McAfee, did not openly blame any country but hinted strongly that China was the most likely culprit, a view endorsed by analysts. China has previouslybeen implicated in a range of alleged incidents of cyberspying \u2013 a practice Beijing vehemently denies \u2013 including a concerted attack on Google and several attempts to prise secrets from computers at the Foreign Office. But the McAfee report is among the most thorough attempts yet to map the scale and range of such data-theft efforts. The study traced the spread of one particular spying malware, usually spread by a &quot;phishing&quot; email which, if opened, downloaded a hidden programme on to the computer network. Through tracing this malware and also gaining access to a &quot;command and control&quot; computer server used by the intruders, McAfee identified 72 compromised companies and organisations. Many more had been hacked but could not be identified from the logs. &quot;After painstaking analysis of the logs, even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim organisations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators,&quot; said Dmitri Alperovitch, the company&apos;s head of threat research and the author of the report. Of the hacking victims 49 were US-based, among them various arms of federal, state and local government, as well as defence contractors and other industries. There were two targets in the UK, a defence company and a computer security firm, while other governments included those of Taiwan, South Korea, and India. Also found on the logs were records from the United Nations, the International Olympic Committee and two national Olympic committees \u2013 one of which was accessed by the hackers for more than two years continuously. McAfee was at pains not to identify the suspected culprit. However, it did little to disguise its suspicions, noting that the targeting of the Olympic groups, and the sport&apos;s anti-doping agency, immediately before and after the 2008 Beijing Games was &quot;particularly intriguing&quot; and pointed to a country being to blame. China has been accused in the past. After Google came under a so-called &quot;advanced persistent attack&quot; in 2009 which it said originated in China, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, asked Beijing for an explanation. This year William Hague said a &quot;hostile state intelligence agency&quot; \u2013 identified by UK sources as China \u2013 had penetrated the Foreign Office&apos;s internal communications system. While a high proportion of media attention on cybersecurity focuses on the loss of personal data, such as the recent security breaches at Sony, and the activities of hacking collectives such as LulzSec, analysts say this is often minor when compared with the methodical, industrial-scale attempts to seize commercial and state secrets, presumed to be carried out by many countries, chief among them China. Alperovitch said state-orchestrated hacking was so endemic and ambitious it could reshape the workings of the global economy. &quot;What we have witnessed over the past five to six years has been nothing short of a historically unprecedented transfer of wealth,&quot; he said. If only a fraction of the stolen data was used to gain commercial or technological advantage &quot;the loss represents a massive economic threat not just to individual companies and industries but to entire countries that face the prospect of decreased economic growth in a suddenly more competitive landscape and the loss of jobs in industries that lose out to unscrupulous competitors in another part of the world&quot;. Beyond even this, he added, were the national security implications of stolen intelligence or defence files. Such was the endemic scale of this problem, Alperovitch said, that he divided large corporations into two camps: &quot;Those that know they&apos;ve been compromised and those that don&apos;t yet know.&quot; He said: &quot;This is a problem of massive scale that affects nearly every industry and sector of the economies of numerous countries, and the only organisations that are exempt from this threat are those that don&apos;t have anything valuable or interesting worth stealing.&quot; When Google accused China last year the ministry of industry and information technology told the state news agency Xinhua: &quot;Any accusation that the Chinese government participated in cyber-attacks, either in an explicit or indirect way, is groundless and aims to denigrate China. We are firmly opposed to that.&quot; No one was available for comment at the foreign ministry in Beijing. Chinese officials have previously said that China has strict laws against hacking and is itself one of the biggest victims. Dave Clemente, a cybersecurity analyst from the Chatham House thinktank, said it was likely China was also targeted by hackers acting on behalf of other countries. &quot;It&apos;s going in both directions, but probably not to the same extent,&quot; he said. &quot;China has a real motivation to gain these types of industrial secrets, to make that leapfrog. There&apos;s probably less motivation for the US to look to China for industrial secrets or high technology. But certainly there&apos;s things China has which they&apos;re interested in, maybe not for commercial advantage but in a geopolitical sense.&quot; Clemente said McAfee&apos;s characterisation of such hacking efforts as a wholesale theft of intellectual property and secrets was &quot;fairly reasonable&quot;: &quot;It&apos;s confirmed not just by this report but by so many dozens of other incidents which build up to an overall picture.&quot; The effects, however, were harder to quantify: &quot;The blueprints are only part of the picture. The technology for, say, how to build a sophisticated jet engine is one thing, but there&apos;s a whole set of other processes \u2013 the logistics, how to manage the supply chain to build more than one, the long-term management of a really advanced manufacturing process.&quot; While basic security or human errors often made hacking easier than it should be, Clemente said, even the biggest organisations struggle to stop sophisticated attacks: &quot;There&apos;s not much even Google can do if China&apos;s really determined to get inside its networks. It&apos;s not a fair fight in that sense.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/04/close-up-lars-von-trier", "publicationDate": "2011-08-04T16:33:00Z", "tags": ["Lars von Trier", "Film", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Photograph: Shizuo Kambayashi/AP    \u2022 Leonardo DiCaprio is highest paid Hollywood actor \u2022 Harry Potter joins the billion dollar club \u2022 Bollywood Hitler film panned by critics \u2022 Taiwan protests Venice film festival&apos;s &apos;China&apos; label \u2022 BFI report suggests UK film production is hitting the doldrums \u2022 Cary Fukunaga to direct sci-fi thriller Speechless \u2022 Lost Alfred Hitchcock work discovered in New Zealand \u2022 Nick Broomfield&apos;s Sarah Palin documentary to premiere in Toronto \u2022 Paul Schrader and Bret Easton Ellis to get their teeth into Bait \u2022 Shawshank Redemption tree split in half by storm \u2022 Sir Geoff Hurst crosses the line into film with acting role \u2022 Faye Dunaway faces eviction from Manhattan apartment BUT \u2022 She says she&apos;s moving out because of &quot;living conditions&quot; On the blog     Taxi Driver."], "title": "Close up: Lars von Trier aiming to shock again", "article": "The big story (softcore edit) One day, &quot;Naughty Lars von Trier being naughty again&quot; won&apos;t be enough of a headline to grab our attention.

Step forward Topiary, otherwise known as 18-year-old Jake Davis, who was arrested this week at his home in the Shetland Islands and is said to be connected to the hacking collectives LulzSec and Anonymous. Or the 14 people arrested last month by the FBI, and also linked to Anonymous, which launched an electronic assault on the payments website PayPal. But there is another kind of hacker, too: much more mysterious, certainly more dangerous and far harder to contain. This week the cyber-security firm McAfee released details of what it called &quot;Operation Shady RAT&quot;, a five-year attack on at least 72 governments and international organisations, including the US, India, Taiwan and the International Olympic Committee. But not, significantly, China. Is the Chinese government \u2013 or Chinese hackers and state organisations monitored by the government \u2013 responsible for this attack and others like it? Much evidence says that it is. In July the Pentagon reported that a &quot;foreign intelligence&quot; service had hacked the systems of a contractor and obtained details of 24,000 files, including ones on missile tracking and remote drones. In June the IMF was hacked, causing the World Bank to suspend the computer connection to its sister organisation. Early this year Google reported details of Operation Aurora, a year-long attack on many of the titans of corporate America. The aim was to steal the intellectual property contained in their badly protected source code. &quot;We look to China for an explanation,&quot; Hillary Clinton said afterwards. In February, in a speech on cyber-security, William Hague described an attempt to access secrets about the Trident missile system. China, unsurprisingly, denies involvement. &quot;It is hard to attribute the real source of attacks and we need to work together to make sure that this security problem won&apos;t be a problem,&quot; the country&apos;s defence minister said in June. And it is true that China is not the only suspect. Iran appears to be engaged in a low-level cyberwar with the US and Israel. India is being watched, too. The US, which says in some circumstances a cyber-attack could be considered an act of war, is scrambling to erect secure firewall barriers; Britain&apos;s national security strategy lists cyberwarfare as one of the principal threats. No single state can deal with this alone. International co-operation is lacking. Britain and the US are pushing for a new international charter of data security.

While China says it will only ever use naval power for defensive purposes, others say it is increasingly aggressive in pursuing its claims. Hours after the trials began, Taiwan pointedly unveiled its most advanced missile, hailing it as &quot;an aircraft carrier killer&quot;. The refitting of the former Soviet vessel is part of China&apos;s broader naval modernisation programme \u2013 which includes heavy spending on submarines and the development of an anti-ship missile system \u2013 and comes amid growing competition with the US and India, and a string of maritime disputes with closer neighbours. &quot;This is showing to the whole world that China&apos;s maritime mobility is expanding drastically. This is showing that China is in the process of acquiring capability to control the South China Sea as well as the East China Sea,&quot; Yoshihiko Yamada, a professor at Japan&apos;s Tokai University, told Reuters. In the past year China has had seen a series of territorial spats with Japan over islets in the East China Sea; and with the Philippines, Vietnam and others over the South China Sea, the location of essential shipping lanes and important natural resources including oil and gas. Those disputes are complicated by underlying competition with the US and India. &quot;By itself, the ship does not erode the credibility of America&apos;s military presence in the region nor greatly increase China&apos;s power projection capabilities. Nevertheless, the vessel is a potent symbol of China&apos;s aspirations to become a global maritime power and is yet another indication that the military balance of power is gradually shifting in China&apos;s favour,&quot; said Dr Ian Storey, of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. Last week, Japan&apos;s annual defence report said the Chinese navy were likely to increase activities around Japan and warned that China had acted &quot;in a way seen as coercive&quot; in conflicts. Beijing responded by accusing Tokyo of irresponsible exaggeration. The test is a small step in the long journey towards building a viable carrier group, but it is already stoking unease in India, and prompting fears of an arms race between Asia&apos;s two emerging powers. The Indian Ocean is fast becoming a zone of contested influence between Beijing and Delhi. Indian strategists have been particularly worried by a string of ports constructed with Chinese assistance in Burma, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. &quot;The carrier will add a new dimension to the burgeoning Chinese navy which could provide a major challenge to India in its backyard, the Indian Ocean,&quot; the Times of India commented on Wednesday. Despite a \u00a310bn modernisation programme, much of the Indian armed forces&apos; on equipment is outdated, and efforts to build or buy aircraft carriers have been hampered by political wrangling and red tape. The Indian navy has a small 50-year old 28,000-tonne carrier, which it bought from the UK in 1987, but it aims to have at least two aircraft carrier battle groups in operation by 2015. The ongoing refit of the 44,570-tonne Admiral Gorshkov, purchased from Russia in 2005, and the construction in India of a new 40,000-tonne carrier are expected to be completed in the coming three to four years.&quot;We are definitely looking at deploying two aircraft carriers by the middle of this decade,&apos;&apos; assistant chief of naval staff (foreign cooperation and intelligence) Rear Admiral Anil Chawla said earlier this year. Defence analyst Ajaj Shukla said that India retains the lead in naval aviation, but that there was a clear fear of &quot;the projection of Chinese power into the northern Indian Ocean in a new way&quot;. &quot;The Chinese are at an earlier stage but once they set their minds to operating a naval air arm they will catch up pretty fast so it is being carefully watched,&quot; he said. The People&apos;s Liberation Army Navy has also expanded its reach substantially in recent years \u2013 notably participating in international efforts to tackle Somalian pirates and more recently using a warship to support the evacuation of 35,000 Chinese citizens from Libya. &quot;[The trial&apos;s] symbolic significance outweighs its practical significance,&quot; Ni Lexiong, an expert on Chinese maritime policy at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, said. &quot;We&apos;re already a maritime power, and so we need an appropriate force, whether that&apos;s aircraft carriers or battleships, just like the United States or the British empire did.&quot; China has spent almost a decade refitting the vessel, which was towed from the Ukraine in 1998 \u2013 without engines, weapons systems or other such equipment \u2013 although the defence ministry did not formally acknowledge the project until a month ago. The 300m-long vessel sounded its horn three times as it left its shipyard in Dalian, in north-east Liaoning province, amid thick fog, according to the state news agency. The trial is expected to last a few days and Xinhua said tests and refurbishment would continue when the ship returned. China has said it will use the carrier for research and training. It is believed to be building two carriers itself and experts think it wants up to four in all. In an interview published in the China Economic Weekly, Chinese navy Rear Admiral Yin Zhuo said that China planned to build a &quot;very strong battle group&quot; but warned it would be a long and difficult task. &quot;The construction and functional demands of an aircraft carrier are extremely complex,&quot; he said. Ashley Townshend at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney told Reuters that China would require three carriers for a viable strike group, as well as support ships and aircraft, and predicted it would take around a decade to develop. &quot;Many countries have, or are, investing in anti-ship missiles and attack submarines which make large, poorly defended warships such as the Varyag highly vulnerable,&quot; pointed out Storey. &quot;US military officers are very dismissive of the Varyag&apos;s operational capabilities, but are much more concerned about the development of China&apos;s own anti-ship ballistic missiles, which are designed to target US aircraft carriers.&quot; China&apos;s official military budget has more than doubled since 2006, from 298bn yuan to 601bn yuan this year, although it is still dwarfed by that of the US. Thailand, Brazil and India each have a carrier, while the US has eleven. China is the only permanent member of the UN security council without one."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/11/china-aircraft-leader", "publicationDate": "2011-08-10T23:21:12Z", "tags": ["China", "Russia", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "South and Central Asia", "South China Sea"], "sentences": ["Hours after the trial began, Taiwan unveiled a missile which it pointedly described as an aircraft killer."], "title": "China's first aircraft carrier: From Russia with love | Editorial", "article": "The history of ships is sometimes more eloquent than that of their owners. The 33,000-ton Varyag was designed as a Soviet multi-role aircraft carrier. Its sister ship the Kuznetsov survived, but by the time the Soviet Union ceased to exist, the Varyag was a white elephant marooned off a port in the Black Sea. It had not only lost its electronics, but carelessly, its country too. Enter China as a buyer in the car boot sale for Soviet technology. The Varyag was bought for a mere snip, $20m, by a travel agency claiming they would use it as a casino off Macau. No surprise that it ended up in the hands of its real owners, the People&apos;s Liberation Army. Yesterday the Varyag, refitted, with a new radar mast, was given its first sea-trials. One super-power bows out, and another, after an interval of 19 years, steps up. China&apos;s first aircraft carrier will not change the balance of naval power in the South China Sea. The PLA said they would use it for training and as a model for future carriers. But as a mark of future intent, the refurbished carrier is not lost on its immediate neighbours with whom China has a series of territorial claims, Japan and Vietnam, nor the region&apos;s other maritime powers, the US and India. China has been thinking ahead. It has planned its naval strategy for expanding eastwards for the next 30 years. Japanese defence analysts say that by 2015 China could have built three nuclear carrier battle groups. The next question is where China will project this force. The South China Sea is a relatively small area for three carrier battle groups. There is a territorial dispute with Japan over uninhabited islands known as the Senkaku or Diaoyu Islands, west of Okinawa, and a collision between a Chinese fishing boat and Japan coastguard boats near the islands resulted in a major diplomatic incident in September last year. These islands belong to the first island chain in the Pacific and beyond lies a continental shelf whose underwater resources are also in dispute. Japan is not the only neighbour to be concerned by the projection of Chinese naval power. Hours after the trial began, Taiwan unveiled a missile which it pointedly described as an aircraft killer. There have been maritime incidents between Chinese and Vietnamese survey boats. Further afield, the Indian Ocean is fast becoming contested, with a string of ports constructed with Chinese help in Burma, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Chinese analysts say China is already a maritime power and needs an appropriate force like the US and British Empire had. But that is precisely the problem.

A study by Buckingham University found just 27,976 of the 39,103 trainees who qualified in the summer of 2010 were in teaching posts in January 2011. Report co-author Alan Smithers (@profsmithers) says:  &quot;It is no good having excellent entrants and outstanding inspection grades if the trainees do not go into teaching.&quot;  The Independent takes from the same report the news that thousands of trainee teachers in subjects suffering a shortage would be barred from the profession, under Gove&apos;s plan to remove government funding for anyone with less than a 2:2 degree who wants to train as a teacher. One in three modern language teachers would no longer receive funding for their training as a result. The reports names Billericay Educational Consortium ahead of both Oxford and Cambridge as the best place to train as a teacher. \u2022 The Telegraph reports that people who are bad at maths were probably born that way.

In Australia, the USA and Canada, he said, leisure-time physical activity drops off rapidly from early middle age and is simply not on the agenda for a large proportion of the population. &quot;In these chronically inactive populations, much of the problems that we are seeing can be attributed to people being stuck for long periods of time in front of screens for work and entertainment, and stuck in automobiles to get to and from work,&quot; said Owen. &quot;Thus, there is very little functional physical activity in people&apos;s lives, and many adults will sit for 10 or 12 hours a day. The real action is in promoting physically active transport and a range of initiatives that will help people to reduce the vast amounts of time that they spend sitting.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/cloud-computing-climate-change", "publicationDate": "2011-08-18T15:10:19Z", "tags": ["Low carbon ICT", "Guardian sustainable business", "Data centres", "Cloud computing"], "sentences": ["Similarly, in August 2009 the rainfall from Typhoon Morakot caused rivers to flood in Taiwan flushing large volumes of sediment into the ocean.", "It disrupted the Internet and telecommunications between Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and other parts of Southeast Asia."], "title": "Cloud computing \u2013 a green opportunity or climate change risk?", "article": "Cloud computing enables users to to share resources and carry out tasks remotely. Rather than using your own local PCs or servers to do the work, you connect to a remote data centre, often provided by an IT services or software company. It means more computing is migrating to purpose-built data centres. From a low carbon perspective it&apos;s no bad thing. Data centres tend to be more energy efficient than individual servers distributed around an organisation and, while there is still vast room for improvement, many companies are working to make their computing facilities more energy efficient. Software and IT services suppliers, for example, have been vying to be seen as the greenest provider \u2013 apart from the PR value there is a great deal of money to be saved in greater energy efficiency. There is also growing evidence of the extent of energy and emissions that can be saved from cloud computing. A report from cleantech market intelligence firm Pike Research found that the adoption of cloud computing will lead to a 38% reduction in worldwide data centre energy expenditure by 2020, compared to what would otherwise be used. The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) reached a similar conclusion, finding that large US companies that use cloud computing will be able to save $12.3bn in energy costs and 85.7 million metric tons of CO2 emissions annually by 2020. The energy savings are equivalent to 200 million barrels of oil \u2013 enough to power 5.7 million cars for one year. But cloud computing comes with its own issues of security and reliability. Companies are often reluctant to trust their data and computing to a remote supplier and climate change itself may make cloud computing less attractive. The Foresight Programme from the UK&apos;s Government Office for Science produces in-depth studies looking at major issues 20-80 years in the future. It recently published a report on the International Dimensions of Climate Change that identifies a significant vulnerability from cloud computing. As more data centres are needed, and with the UK a relatively expensive location, more will be going offshore, but that makes them potentially more vulnerable to climate change impacts. The report points out that data storage facilities have already suffered from flooding and cites the Vodafone data centre in Ikitelli, Turkey, which was affected by flash flooding in 2009, putting a quarter of the local network at risk. Similarly, in August 2009 the rainfall from Typhoon Morakot caused rivers to flood in Taiwan flushing large volumes of sediment into the ocean. This led to several submarine landslides which broke at least nine communications cables 4000m down. It disrupted the Internet and telecommunications between Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and other parts of Southeast Asia. The study also makes the point that over 95% of global communications traffic is handled by just one million kilometres of undersea fibre-optic cable. Rising sea levels increase the risk of flooding of coastal cable facilities and may also affect the stability of the seabed, making cables more vulnerable. It makes worrying reading. While we are all fighting to try and minimise climate change, we&apos;re already too far down the road to stop some of the inevitable impacts.

Officials have placed the boy band&apos;s anodyne 1990s hit on a blacklist of 100 songs that music websites must remove by 15 September, alongside hits by Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Britney Spears. A notice from the ministry said the songs had not been submitted for approval. A 2009 directive designed to tackle &quot;poor taste and vulgar content&quot; as well as copyright violations said all hosted tracks had to be cleared by officials. The new announcement appears to apply to legal streaming and download services as well as illicit ones. It warned that unauthorised tracks \u2013 as well as unregistered sites \u2013 disturbed the online market for music and harmed national cultural security, adding that sites should carry out &quot;self-inspection and self-correction&quot;. Sites which do not remove the content before 15 September will be prosecuted, unless the songs are submitted for approval. Only their owners can do that. How the officials picked out the 100 titles on the list remains a mystery. Although some are recent releases, the Backstreet Boys track is already 12 years old. Katy Perry&apos;s Last Friday Night has lyrics about streaking in a park, drinking shots and a menage a trois, and Beyonc\u00e9&apos;s Run the World (Girls) includes the implied profanity of the line: &quot;We run this mutha.&quot; But other choices \u2013 such as the Backstreet Boys&apos; hit or Britney Spears&apos;s Burning Up \u2013 are hardly racy. Most of the condemned songs are from Taiwan or Hong Kong \u2013 such as Yu Wenle&apos;s superbly titled You Say I&apos;m Too Handsome \u2013 but Lady Gaga leads the field with no fewer than six banned tracks: The Edge of Glory, Hair, Marry the Night, Americano, Judas and Bloody Mary. Other outlawed titles by western artists include four by Canadian rockers Simple Plan, three by US electronic act Owl City and three by American singer-songwriter Natalie Walker. Music sites cannot submit the songs for approval as only the owners of the material can do so. The ministry of culture did not respond to queries about the list. Tracks by Eminem, Christina Aguilera and Kylie Minogue fell foul of a sweep by the ministry earlier this year. In April, officials said they would punish 14 sites that had provided illegal downloads. The ministry also controls events such as concerts.

In addition to the launch of the smaller iPhone 4, Apple is targeting an end-September launch for the next-generation iPhone 5, one source told Reuters, confirming earlier reports on blogs and industry websites. The new iPhone \u2013 which some have dubbed the iPhone 4S because of its largely identical appearance to the existing iPhone 4 \u2013 will have a bigger touchscreen, better antenna and an 8MP camera, one source told Reuters. Its two manufacturers have been told to prepare production capacity for up to 45m units altogether, the source said. The phone will be made by Hon Hai Precision Industries and Pegatron Corp, the person added. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that the Sprint network will begin selling a new version of the iPhone in the US from mid-October, which would make it the third distributor for Apple&apos;s products in the US after AT&amp;T and Verizon. Reuters said Asian suppliers have begun making a lower-cost version of the hot-selling smartphone with just 8GB of flash storage, to arrive around the same time Apple unveils its iPhone 5. The move would mean Apple, which has stuck to the higher end of the booming mobile and smartphone market since unveiling the iPhone in January 2007, would be seeking out new markets at new price points to sustain the rapid growth that has seen its stock value rise to make it the world&apos;s most valuable company by market capitalisation. Apple sold 20.34m iPhones in the second quarter versus an expected 17m to 18m, and is increasingly looking to Asia to boost future results. It is in talks with leading Chinese carriers China Mobile and China Telecom Corp, both are eager to begin selling the iPhone officially. China represents the largest untapped market for smartphones, a sector that is roughly doubling in size annually \u2013although some analysts think that 2011 will mark its fastest growth. &quot;A lower-priced version of iPhone 4 seems to be a necessary evil at this point in the iPhone adoption cycle, especially in emerging markets where the average income of individuals is much lower,&quot; said Channing Smith, co-manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund, which owns Apple shares. Pat Becker, portfolio manager at Becker Capital Management, said Apple is looking to take a chunk of the market that is currently dominated by Nokia, which is widely expected to release a new phone running on Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone software by the end of the year. Nokia dominates the lower end, while Apple has so far focused only on the premium market. But the Finnish company&apos;s decision announced in January to discontinue its Symbian platform, and the rapid sales growth in the far east of handsets using Google&apos;s free Android mobile operating system, has eroded Nokia&apos;s market share substantially in China, formerly one of its strongholds. Apple&apos;s move would also echo its approach to the music-player market, which it dominated by introducing a number of lower-cost devices such as the iPod mini, shuffle and nano once it had established its top-end dominance with the original player. A cheaper phone risks cannibalising Apple&apos;s premium iPhone model and pressuring margins, but the California company needs to expand its emerging market share, analysts say. &quot;Your best defence is sometimes your offence,&quot; Becker said. The Wall Street Journal said Sprint plans to sell the iPhone 5 with an unlimited data plan for contract phones, a policy abandoned by other carriers but which is still seen as an effective method to attract new customers. &quot;Combined with the company&apos;s marketing focus on its unlimited plan, iPhone would drive a rebound in subscriber growth,&quot; said Mizuho analyst Michael Nelson who said it could help Sprint exceed his expectation for fourth-quarter net subscriber additions of about 190,000. Since Verizon and Sprint use the same CDMA network technology, which differs from the GSM system used by AT&amp;T and European carriers, analysts have long speculated that it made sense for Apple to widen its distribution to Sprint, having added Verizon in January. While Sprint executives have previously said they would like to sell the iPhone, they have never confirmed they were in talks with Apple to do so. Apple, which demands high levels of secrecy and security from suppliers and employees, would not comment. The iPhone 4 was launched June 2010 in black 16GB and 32GB versions, with white versions added to the lineup in April 2011. The 8GB version is expected within weeks, two separate sources have told Reuters. &quot;Apple may want to push into the emerging market segment, where customers want to switch to low- to mid-end smartphones from high-end feature phones, which usually cost $150 [\u00a391] to $200,&quot; said Yuanta Securities analyst Bonnie Chang. &quot;But I think for an 8GB iPhone 4, the price is hard to go below $200, so Apple will still need a completely new phone with low specifications for the emerging markets.&quot; An iPhone 4 without contract commitments now costs more than $600, and the largest untapped market for buyers lies among those who buy mobile phones on a &quot;pay as you go&quot; basis. Apple&apos;s chief operating officer, Tim Cook, said in July the company is optimistic about greater China, in which Apple includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. &quot;I firmly believe that we are just scratching the surface right now,&quot; Cook said about China. &quot;I think there is an incredible opportunity for China there.&quot; Asia Pacific \u2013 accounting for about one-fifth of Apple&apos;s total revenue \u2013 and greater China in particular helped Apple&apos;s revenue surge 82% to $28.6bn in April to June.

Acer also said it would be impossible to break even for the full year. Acer has been a dominant force in the PC business, particularly in the low-cost notebook market, but has failed to counter the runaway success of tablets such as Apple&apos;s iPad. The company has been refocusing on mobile devices to drive growth after a first half that saw the acrimonious departure of its chief executive following a row over the company&apos;s strategy and a series of cuts to its shipment forecasts. Shares of Acer, the world&apos;s No 2 PC vendor, closed down 2.92% on Wednesday ahead of the earnings announcement. They have fallen 65% this year in a broader market down 16.4%. Rival Asustek gained 6.8%. The Acer chairman, JT Wang, told an investor conference that the second-quarter was a &quot;correction period&quot; and its loss was worse than expected because the company cleared up excessive inventory and made severance payments for senior management resignations. Among those who resigned was Gianfranco Lanci, the former chief executive, who left abruptly in April amid a row over strategy and after a sharp cut in Acer&apos;s revenue outlook that triggered an 18% fall in shares in four days. Wang did not say how much Lanci received. Wang said although he expects the &quot;fever&quot; for tablet PCs receding and notebooks to regain consumer interest, Acer will see a loss in the third quarter, though it would be better than the second quarter. &quot;Today I have to say, trying to break even this year becomes impossible,&quot; Wang said, citing a worsening macro environment in Europe and the need for &quot;more time and effort&quot; for the restructuring. In July, Wang had indicated the company would report a loss in the second quarter before returning to profit in the third and posting a small full-year profit. Acer said in June it would take a $150m (\u00a390m) charge to write off inventory and doubtful payments in Europe and will cut 300 jobs there. The Macquarie analyst, Andrew Chang, said in a report that recent checks indicate Acer has no new competitive products to launch in the third quarter to lift momentum and margins. Macquarie expects flat revenue growth in the third quarter from the previous quarter and a 29% drop from a year ago. Acer posted a net loss of T$6.79bn (\u00a3141.7m) in April to June, much wider than the consensus forecast of a T$3.3bn loss from six analysts polled by Reuters.

S&amp;P cut the United States&apos; prized AAA rating one notch to AA+ on 5 August, exacerbating a sell-off in global stock markets that had already been hit by Europe&apos;s growing sovereign debt crisis and fears of a renewed US recession. &quot;From our perspective, it&apos;s an oversimplification to say this was happening because of S&amp;P&apos;s downgrade,&quot; said David Beers, S&amp;P&apos;s global head of sovereign ratings, referring to criticism that the move caused volatility in the market. S&amp;P is one of three main firms that analyse the creditworthiness of businesses and sovereign states, along with rivals Moody&apos;s and Fitch. They have faced severe criticism for their failure to predict the credit crunch and subsequent bank insolvencies. S&amp;P&apos;s officials have said the US downgrade was mostly based on their view that politics in Washington has become too divisive to ensure more deficit-reduction measures are adopted next year. The US vice-president, Joe Biden, said he believed the downgrade was excessive and the resignation of the S&amp;P president, Deven Sharma, this week was recognition by the firm that it had been wrong to be overly cautious. World stocks, as measured by MSCI&apos;s All-Country World Index, have fallen more than 17% from their May high as markets lose faith in the ability of politicians in rich economies to tackle debt burdens. In Europe, investors are increasingly worried that eurozone leaders have been unable to contain the debt crisis that has swamped Greece, Portugal and Ireland and now threatens bigger, much harder to save economies such as Spain and Italy. Japan, meanwhile, with a public debt twice the size of the $3tn economy, is looking for its sixth leader in five years after prime minister Naoto Kan confirmed on Friday his intention to step down. &quot;We&apos;re waiting to see if the governments can get their act together and address both the short-term and long-term issues,&quot; Beers told journalists at a press conference in Singapore, referring to developed countries in general. He added that monetary and fiscal tools that could be used to boost sluggish economic growth would be of limited use if households in rich nations continued to focus on reducing their own debt rather than spending. &quot;One of the lessons that we&apos;re perhaps learning from this crisis, and this applies to many countries, not just the US, is the limits of what these sorts of fiscal and monetary policies can achieve,&quot; Beers said. S&amp;P,also said that the outlook for Asian sovereigns was stable, but was showing some downside risks. Most Asian countries, especially those such as Singapore, South Korea or Taiwan with a higher share of exports to western countries, would be hurt if the US or European economies continued to slow, said Elena Okorotchenko, managing director at S&amp;P."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/26/bad-science-vitamin-pills-lead-you-to-take-risks", "publicationDate": "2011-08-26T21:01:00Z", "tags": ["Health", "Health & wellbeing", "Life and style", "Smoking", "Society", "Psychology", "Medical research", "Science"], "sentences": ["Because it was Taiwan, where lots of people smoke, they were told: &quot;This survey will take you about one hour to finish \u2026 you&apos;re allowed to smoke if you want.&quot; The results were startling."], "title": "Vitamin pills can lead you to take health risks | Ben Goldacre", "article": "We all have irrational fears\u00a0\u2013 flying is plainly scarier than getting in a car \u2013 and we all have odd rituals that we use to manage them. But what if we believed our own hype about these rituals and became cocksure, perhaps even harming ourselves? Here is a concrete example. In the study of risk perception, people talk about &quot;the licensing effect&quot;: when you take a vitamin pill, for example, you think you&apos;ve done something healthy and wholesome, so you permit yourself to eat more chips and have a cigarette. It sounds like a nice idea, but a bit vague. Two new experiments put flesh on these bones. Firstly, researchers took 74 undergraduates who were daily smokers, and divided them into two groups at random. The first group were given a dummy pill, a placebo, and were told just that: you&apos;re in the control group, taking a dummy pill, with no active ingredient. The other participants were in the vitamin pill group: you&apos;ve been given a vitamin pill, they were told. But in fact, the researchers had lied. Everyone in the study got the same dummy pill, with no active ingredient. Half of them thought they&apos;d had a health-giving vitamin pill, because the intention was to see whether people&apos;s health behaviours change if they think they&apos;ve had a nice, healthy vitamin pill. After the pills, they were given a survey to fill out. Because it was Taiwan, where lots of people smoke, they were told: &quot;This survey will take you about one hour to finish \u2026 you&apos;re allowed to smoke if you want.&quot; The results were startling. Firstly, people who thought they&apos;d had a vitamin pill gave different answers on the survey. These featured questions from the excellently titled Adolescent Invulnerability Scale (which has been reasonably well validated elsewhere), such as &quot;Special problems, getting an illness or disease, are not likely to happen to me&quot;, &quot;I&apos;m unlikely to be injured in an accident&quot;, and so on. People who thought they&apos;d had a vitamin pill rated themselves as generally more invulnerable. The results for smoking were more worrying. There&apos;s no doubt smoking is bad for you. There&apos;s also no doubt the motives and justifications for smoking are complex. But people who thought they&apos;d had a vitamin pill were 50% more\u00a0likely to have a cigarette \u2013 89% compared with 62% \u2013 and that result was highly statistically significant. This might be a good moment to pause and remember that the Cochrane review on antioxidant vitamin pills \u2013 the pills that glossy magazines most like to recommend \u2013 found around 200,000 patients&apos; worth of good randomised trial data, and overall, these pills do nothing to prolong life: if anything, it turns out, they actively increase your risk of dying. So back to our study on risk compensation behaviour. They broadened the design in case students are somehow an\u00a0exceptional case, and repeated the experiment with 80 new participants, aged 19 to 58, from the wider community: once again, the people who thought they&apos;d had vitamin pills smoked more cigarettes, and once again they believed themselves to be more invulnerable to harm. So they expanded the project even further, into two longer studies, broader in remit, and this time people who thought they&apos;d had a vitamin pill were less likely to exercise and less likely to choose healthier food. People often ask what the harm is from quackery. I don&apos;t think there needs to be one: quackery, overall, is more interesting than it is dangerous. But the message from these trials is clear. Believing, incorrectly, that you&apos;ve done something healthy by taking a vitamin pill makes you more likely to take genuine, concrete, real-world risks with your health. It&apos;s a chilling thought, but ideas aren&apos;t without impact, and every time we humour a harmless myth \u2013 that vitamin pills are healthy, that some fashionable berry prevents cancer \u2013 we might be doing more harm than we think."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/aug/28/george-band-obituary", "publicationDate": "2011-08-28T17:44:00Z", "tags": ["Mountaineering", "Mount Everest", "India", "Nepal", "Royal Dutch Shell"], "sentences": ["Band was born in Taiwan, then under Japanese control, where his parents were Presbyterian missionaries.", "Leaving Taiwan a fortnight before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Band went to Eltham college, in south London, where he excelled at athletics, breaking those school records not set by an earlier pupil and son of missionaries, Eric Liddell."], "title": "George Band obituary", "article": "Fourteen mountains exceed the magical threshold of 8,000 metres (26,250ft), but British climbers were first to the top of just one of them \u2013 Kangchenjunga, the third-highest peak in the world. On 25 May 1955, a tall Cambridge graduate called George Band, who has died aged 82, and a short Mancunian builder called Joe Brown took the last breathless steps towards the summit. They stopped a few feet short, in deference to religious sentiment in Sikkim, where locals believed the mountain to be sacred. The ascent of Kangchenjunga was one of the very best achievements in British mountaineering history, in many ways surpassing the 1953 ascent of Everest, in which Band was also involved. The public knew Everest, however, and the long struggle to climb it, whereas success on &quot;Kanch&quot; was much lower key. As Band himself explained, the achievement&apos;s relative obscurity was partly down to its leader, Charles Evans, deeply admired but equally modest. &quot;He wasn&apos;t one to shout things from the rooftops,&quot; Band observed. &quot;He just got on with the job in a quiet sort of way.&quot; The 1955 team was not really expected to get to the summit at all. Kangchenjunga had long been considered the highest mountain in the world. Partly due to its proximity to Darjeeling, plenty of expeditions had attempted Kangchenjunga, including in 1905 a team that included the diabolist Aleister Crowley. They had made little progress up the south-west face, considered by some too dangerous to contemplate. But Band and his companions chose this approach for what was conceived as a reconnaissance. No one had been higher than 6,400 metres on this side of the peak. Kangchenjunga held far more secrets than Everest, which had almost been climbed on several occasions before 1953. The thought of walking up to the bottom of such a huge and untested face and climbing it first go was almost too much to contemplate. The attitude among old hands at the Alpine Club in London, before Band&apos;s departure, was &quot;rather you than me&quot;. Kangchenjunga&apos;s proximity to the Bay of Bengal had worrying implications for the team. The monsoon arrives with full force and the peak gets more snow than mountains further west, in the Everest region. The avalanche risk was greater. Band lay in his tent at base camp, following the toughest approach trek he ever experienced, marking off avalanches on his tent pole with a pencil. After 24 hours he had counted 48 thundering down the south-west face. Allowing that he had slept for a third of that time, Band calculated avalanches were occurring every 20 minutes. The expedition faced immediate difficulties. &quot;The lower icefall was horrific,&quot; Band said, &quot;and we were absolutely extended. But then we saw this little gully up on the left that seemed to circumvent seven-eights of it. Charles suggested Norman [Hardie] and I have a crack and hey presto!&quot; Having cleverly bypassed the lower icefall and pitched Camp 2, they found the upper section much safer. &quot;That was thrilling, because we thought at last we&apos;re launched on the face.&quot; Above it, the expedition reached what was dubbed the &quot;Great Shelf&quot;, the main objective for their reconnaissance. The team was working well and they could see a route ahead. Why not keep going? Evans, with Hardie, established Camp 5 at over 7,600 metres, high enough to consider a push for the top. Back at base camp he appeared at lunch, mug of tea in hand, to announce that Band and Brown would be the first summit team. He and Neil Mather, with help from the best Sherpas, would establish Camp 6 and then let them get on with it. The stage was set. Band was born in Taiwan, then under Japanese control, where his parents were Presbyterian missionaries. Leaving Taiwan a fortnight before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Band went to Eltham college, in south London, where he excelled at athletics, breaking those school records not set by an earlier pupil and son of missionaries, Eric Liddell. At Queens&apos; College, Cambridge, he also met Harold Abrahams, who would do the timekeeping at athletics meets. He also excelled at his greater passion for climbing at Cambridge, becoming president of the university&apos;s mountaineering club. As an undergraduate he climbed the North Ridge of the Dent Blanche, which caught the attention of the previous generation, and his impressive alpine record and obvious ambition won him a place on the Everest team for 1953, as the youngest member, aged just 23 when selected. Everest was still a public-school affair, and Band&apos;s expedition diary typically recalled his joy at Cambridge winning the Boat Race. Band himself described his fellow climbers as &quot;club players \u2013 like the London Irish \u2013 rather than internationals&quot;. Since he had served in the Signals during national service, the expedition leader John Hunt put Band in charge of the team&apos;s radio equipment. This at least allowed Band to tune into a Hall\u00e9 Orchestra concert broadcast from the Manchester Free Trade Hall while perched in the Western Cwm. Music remained a great passion throughout his life. When he told Hunt that he had actually been in charge of the mess, Band was given the task of sorting out the food as well, with expedition doctor Griff Pugh. This was more welcome. As Band told his fellow climber Wilfrid Noyce: &quot;I&apos;m very interested in food.&quot; Noyce, a poet, gave an elegant description of Band: &quot;Tall, he had an immensely long reach; and bespectacled, with curved nose and smile that flashed suddenly upon the world, he had an air of benevolent learning which added tone to our expedition.&quot; Two years later, on Kangchenjunga, the impact of working-class stars taking their place in the front rank of mountaineering nations was reflected in the composition of Evans&apos;s team. Band and Brown appeared an incongruous pair, but Brown&apos;s optimism and Band&apos;s experience proved a winning combination. Band had other successes, including the first ascent of Rakaposhi in the Karakoram in 1954, and he did consider a full-time adventuring career, even though his parents asked him when he would start &quot;a proper job&quot;. By the end of the 1950s he was working for Shell in Texas when a millionaire offered to back him on his next big trip. At that point he was faced with a critical decision about which direction his life would move in. When he asked his employers for more leave, he got a very similar letter to the one Chris Bonington opened during his spell at Unilever. Bonington, as he explained in his autobiography&apos;s title, chose to climb, whereas Band would later quip: &quot;I chose to work.&quot; Instead, Band headed for his next assignment with Shell, in the new oil fields of Venezuela, and an encounter with the legendary mountaineer and diplomat Sir Douglas Busk, then ambassador in Caracas. Over the next 30 years, Band worked in oil exploration and climbed all over the world, from Borneo to Oman. There was plenty of time spent in the mountains, but his biggest challenges were now business ones. In 1983 he left his final overseas posting in Malayasia to become director general of the UK Offshore Operators&apos; Association. With his business experience and illustrious climbing record, Band inevitably became part of the mountaineering nomenklatura, serving as president of both the Alpine Club and the British Mountaineering Council, and a board member of the Royal Geographical Society. After retiring from the oil industry, he was also free to spend more time travelling and writing, publishing a history of Everest, 50 Years On Top of the World (2003), and one celebrating 150 years of the Alpine Club, Summit (2006), following an earlier book, Road to Rakaposhi (1955). He returned to Kangchenjunga in 2005, 50 years after the mountain&apos;s first ascent. In 2009, he was appointed OBE. He is survived by his wife, Susan, three children and six grandchildren.  \u2022 George Christopher Band, mountaineer, born 2 February 1929; died 26 August 2011"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/aug/31/hp-touchpad-one-last-batch", "publicationDate": "2011-08-31T06:00:00Z", "tags": ["Tablet computers", "Hewlett-Packard", "Technology", "Computing"], "sentences": ["Digitimes in Taiwan reports that upstream suppliers have been left with a components surplus including parts for a 7in model, which HP has never announced."], "title": "TouchPads: HP says 'one last batch and then that's it'", "article": "If you missed out on the low-cost HP TouchPad \u2013 with its price slashed from \u00a3400 to around \u00a3100 \u2013 but still want one, there&apos;s some good news. Hewlett Packard Co plans to crank out &quot;one last run&quot; of TouchPads, just over a week after declaring it will kill off its tablet line after apparently deciding they had failed to challenge Apple Inc&apos;s command of the booming market. Update: HP says that the new batch will only be available in North America, and &quot;there will be no additional products available in EMEA [Europe, the Middle East and Africa] beyond what is currently available.&quot; In a statement, HP EMEA said: &quot;We are pleased by the response to webOS and look forward to customer feedback so we can further enhance the platform. A limited quantity of TouchPads will be available in the coming weeks in North America only. In EMEA we are discontinuing the webOS hardware operations and will not offer any additional products beyond what might be currently available in selective outlets.&quot; HP has announced a temporary about-face on the gadget after being &quot;pleasantly surprised&quot; by the outsized demand generated by the low cost version \u2013 even though the writedowns, believed to be at least $200 per tablet compared to the cost of manufacture, are losing it millions. According to IHS iSuppli&apos;s preliminary estimates, the 32GB version costs $318 for the parts alone. &quot;The speed at which [the TouchPad] disappeared from inventory has been stunning,&quot; Mark Budgell, of HP&apos;s PR team, said in a blogpost. &quot;We have decided to produce one last run of TouchPads to meet unfulfilled demand. We don&apos;t know exactly when these units will be available or how many we&apos;ll get, and we can&apos;t promise we&apos;ll have enough for everyone. We do know that it will be at least a few weeks before you can purchase.&quot;  Budgell said though that there will be none available for small or medium-sized businesses through HP&apos;s sales channels, possibly indicating that the company will sell only to consumers through retailers in the final batch. HP has not explained why it is continuing to make the tablet to sell at lossmaking prices. Some have speculated that it is trying to clear out parts inventory from factories which had geared up for a more successful run, and that the parts constitute a sunk cost which has to be written off somehow. Digitimes in Taiwan reports that upstream suppliers have been left with a components surplus including parts for a 7in model, which HP has never announced. Digitimes says that the companies had been geared up to make as many as 100,000 per quarter, with production expected to start at the end of September. Even if HP isn&apos;t making money on sales of the TouchPad, some enterprising eBay sellers appear to be: a large number are available on the auction site, being resold for prices of more than $200.  Critics have blasted HP&apos;s management for wavering on pivotal decisions, having stated in , such as its original stated intention to integrate its webOS software into every device it makes, followed by a decision to stop making webOS gadgets, including the TouchPad. The Silicon Valley giant is struggling to shore up margins as smartphones and tablets eat away at its core PC business, which is the world&apos;s largest but is also its least profitable division on paper. On 18 August, chief executive Leo Apotheker said the company was also considering spinning off the PC division \u2013 although other managers have since emphasised that that is a strategic review and that other alternatives, including keeping it, are still on the table. CEO Leo Apotheker is under immense pressure from investors unhappy with HP&apos;s back-and-forth on strategy. The former SAP chief has also been forced to slash HP&apos;s sales estimates three times since he took over last November. In a resounding rejection of his grand vision, shareholders sent HP shares down almost 20% the day it announced its sweeping moves, which included a pricey acquisition of the British software company Autonomy. That wiped out $16bn of value from HP in the stock&apos;s worst single-day fall since the Black Monday stock market crash of October 1987.  Since the beginning of January, the shares are down by almost 40%, while the stock market overall has remained flat."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/31/tesco-japan-pull-out-philip-clarke", "publicationDate": "2011-08-31T19:21:46Z", "tags": ["Tesco", "Japan", "Supermarkets", "Retail industry", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["In 2005, the retailer quit Taiwan by handing over the stores to Carrefour in exchange for outlets in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.", "The original stated that Tesco opened its first overseas store in Hungary in 1995 and that the only other blot on Tesco&apos;s copy book to date is Taiwan."], "title": "Tesco admits defeat and pulls out of Japan", "article": "After ploughing more than \u00a3250m and eight years into trying to crack one of the toughest retail markets in the world, Tesco has admitted defeat and announced that it is pulling out of Japan. The retrenchment is a rare setback for the globe-trotting British retailer, which has spent much of the past decade planting its red, white and blue flag in countries ranging from Turkey to Thailand, and follows the promotion of Philip Clarke, the former head of its sprawling international business, to group chief executive. At his maiden results presentation in April, Clarke set the scene for a major shakeup by promising to improve returns from its overseas investments. &quot;Having made considerable efforts in Japan, we have concluded we cannot build a sufficiently scaleable business,&quot; he said on Wednesday. &quot;We have decided to sell our operations there and focus on our larger businesses in the region.&quot; The decision came after a review of the vast retailer&apos;s Asian arm, which also takes in Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and China and had \u00a311bn sales last year. Clarke succeeded Sir Terry Leahy \u2013 the veteran chief executive behind the rapid overseas growth that turned the British supermarket into the world&apos;s third-largest retailer \u2013 in March, and analysts said it meant he would not balk at pulling the plug on its heavily loss-making US start-up Fresh &amp; Easy if its performance did not improve. The Los Angeles-based American business was the biggest gamble taken by Leahy during 14 years in charge. Shore Capital analyst Darren Shirley said that although the Japanese chain was its smallest overseas chain it was &quot;important from a symbolic and directional sense&quot;. He added: &quot;This decision should send a message throughout the group that Clarke it is not about flag-pitching and is about creating a sustainable, balanced model for growth. Nowhere greater will this decision resonate than in the US, where we forecast over \u00a3700m of accumulated losses by February 2012.&quot; Tesco is not the first foreign retailer to leave Japan with its tail between its legs. Boots the Chemists and France&apos;s Carrefour have also admitted defeat there. The Cheshunt-based supermarket chain arrived in Japan in June 2003 when it acquired Tokyo convenience store chain C Two-Network for \u00a3173m. The push was led by David Reid, now Tesco&apos;s chairman, who at the time described it as a &quot;neat entry&quot; to a market with higher operating margins than in the UK. It made a bolt-on acquisition the following year, acquiring bankrupt convenience store chain Fre&apos;c and taking on \u00a316m of its debt. Analysts said it invested some \u00a310m a year in Japan in a bid to turn the business into a major force in the country. However Tesco appears to have underestimated the difficulties it would counter in Japan, the world&apos;s third-largest grocery market after the US and China, with total sales of $356bn. Gavin Rothwell, research manager at retail analysts IGD, said the country was &quot;notoriously difficult&quot; due to high operating costs and extremely demanding shoppers, with even market leaders Aeon and Ito Yokado battling to increase profits. &quot;The retail market is fragmented and there are many strong regional players, often family-owned,&quot; said Rothwell. &quot;Convenience stores dominate, particularly in the city centres, and a culture of &apos;immediacy&apos; supports large numbers of vending machines.&quot; Tesco had developed an own-label range and even a fresh kitchen to supply fish and other local products to its stores but last year the business, which trades under the names Tsurakame, Tesco and Tesco Express, made an operating loss of \u00a35m on sales of \u00a3476m. &quot;Unfortunately, it has proved to be very difficult to shift consumers from stores they use into new ones,&quot; said Clarke. A formal sale process will now begin, but Tesco said the stores would continue to trade as usual. Analysts estimated the sale would raise between \u00a350m and \u00a375m, a drop in the ocean for the retailer, which made profits of \u00a33.8bn on sales of \u00a367.6bn last year. Tesco had already written down the goodwill on its Japanese business and had halted further investment. The shares closed up 13.8p at 378.6p. Tesco made its first foray overseas in the 1980s when it acquired H Williams in Ireland (although it later sold the business) and has gone on to open 2,750 stores outside the UK. Although 65% of the group&apos;s store space is now overseas, the domestic chain still generates the lion&apos;s share of group profits and Clarke wants to focus on markets where it can be either the market leader or in second place. In the UK, Tesco has a market share of 30.5%, whereas in Japan it has less than 1%. Building an international empire has not been plain sailing: in 1997,one of Leahy&apos;s first decisions as chief executive was to sell French business Catteau, the same year it also re-entered Ireland. In 2005, the retailer quit Taiwan by handing over the stores to Carrefour in exchange for outlets in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.  Clarke insisted the decision to withdraw from Japan had no bearing on the future of Fresh &amp; Easy, but he has already made it clear that the next two years will be critical for the business headed by deputy chief executive Tim Mason. The 176-store chain made a loss of \u00a3186m on sales of \u00a3502m last year and Clarke wants to see a significant reduction in the current financial year and for it to reach break-even towards the end of 2012. The stores are being refurbished after shoppers complained they were too clinical, with the introduction of wooden flooring and flower stands at the entrances, while new products such as takeaway coffee and pastries, key draws for US consumers, have been introduced.F&amp;E will also trial an &quot;Express&quot; format this year which, at 3,000sq ft, will be less than a third of the size of the stores it has opened to date. Leahy retirement has triggered a changing of the guard at Tesco, with Andrew Higginson, one of his key lieutenants, announcing he was quitting last week. The head of its retailing services division which includes the Tesco Bank said he would go next year after serving 15 years on the supermarket group&apos;s board. Reid is retiring in November to be replaced by Sir Richard Broadbent, Barclays&apos; deputy chairman. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 September 2011.

Achim Berg, Microsoft&apos;s head of Windows Phone marketing, told Bloomberg that forecasts by market analysts that the operating system will have a 20% share by 2015 are conservative \u2013 even though it is languishing with a 1.6% world market share in the second quarter of the year according to the analysts Gartner. &quot;This is a completely new platform, it takes time,&quot; Berg told Bloomberg. &quot;It took time with Android, it took time with Apple. We have to show that we&apos;re very capable and that we have the fastest and easiest phone.&quot; Part of that effort will involve tutoring shop staff selling the handsets in how to show off the phones to best effect. Other analysts say that Windows Phone has a mountain to climb in order to reach the aim expressed by Stephen Elop, chief executive of Nokia \u2013 which will use Windows Phone in forthcoming smartphones \u2013 of becoming the &quot;third ecosystem&quot; in the field alongside Google&apos;s Android and Apple&apos;s iOS. Horace Dediu, a former Nokia executive who now runs the independent consultancy Asymco, noted that in the US Android and iOS phones cumulatively outnumber Windows Phone devices \u2013 which there have a 4.5% share \u2013 by 12 to one: &quot;To become the largest mobile platform in the US, as some analysts are predicting, Microsoft has a 12:1 disadvantage that looks to continue to grow.

We see a strong Q4,&quot; Florian Seiche, head of HTC&apos;s business in Europe, Middle East and Africa, told Reuters at the IFA consumer electronics show in Berlin. He said good demand for its latest models was continuing, despite macroeconomic worries and longer replacement cycles in some countries. On 29 July, HTC gave a better than expected forecast for the third quarter, estimating sales of all its phones \u2013 which includes both Android and Windows Phone smarpthones \u2013 would double from a year ago to 13.5m, while its gross margin would be around 28%, down from 29-30% in previous quarters. HTC&apos;s shares have fallen as much as 40% from their peak in April because of the slowing growth, courtroom fights with Apple over patents and stiff competition. Microsoft has also won a per-handset payment \u2013 believed to be around $5 (\u00a33) \u2013 for each Android handset HTC ships after claiming that HTC&apos;s Android phones infringe its patents. Analysts say HTC needs new markets to sustain growth and will have to call again on the speed and innovation that turned the once obscure Taiwanese company into a global brand in five years and propelled its market value beyond that of Nokia this year. &quot;HTC will be hoping the heightened awareness of Windows Phone as a result of Nokia cosying up to Microsoft will help kick-start interest in these new phones after the dismal reception of Windows Phone this time last year,&quot; said Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight. Nokia, still the world&apos;s largest cellphone vendor by volume, has decided to dump its own Symbian software in favour of Windows Phone. The first devices, running Mango, are expected later this autumn, but analysts think that it will not be before late spring next year that the Finnish company will have a range of handsets with which to target the market. Meanwhile, the company fell into loss in the last quarter, and that is not expected to improve this year. Microsoft first announced Windows Phone in February 2010, ditching its longstanding Windows Mobile operating system in the face of competition from Apple&apos;s iPhone and Google&apos;s Android. Windows Phone was launched in October 2010, but the company has given few details about how many handset licences have been sold as market figures have suggested a slow start."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/sep/06/arts-diary", "publicationDate": "2011-09-06T21:30:02Z", "tags": ["Venice film festival 2011", "World cinema", "Steve McQueen", "Venice film festival", "Art and design", "Kate Winslet", "Festivals", "Awards and prizes", "Film", "Culture"], "sentences": ["It is Taiwan&apos;s biggest budget film ($25m) and may well be one of the bloodiest ever shown at Venice."], "title": "This week's arts diary", "article": "Kate Winslet&apos;s award-deserving vomit By general consent, this year&apos;s\u00a0Venice film festival has\u00a0been a\u00a0standout.

Not so. The invention of kangaroo care (also called kangaroo therapy) is widely attributed to a pair of doctors in Colombia in the late 1970s. Initially, both the idea and the name triggered scepticism. Thus the appearance in 1990 of a paper called Kangaroo Care: Not a Useless Therapy, in a magazine published by America&apos;s National Association of Neonatal Nurses. The idea of kangaroo care is for premature babies to spend most of their time being held or pressed against the mother, the two maintaining direct &quot;skin-to-skin&quot; contact. This was meant as a substitute for incubators in places where those were unavailable. Later, some doctors and nurses began recommending that even the most modern hospitals adopt the practice. Eventually came attempts to see whether \u2013 or not \u2013 kangaroo care produces good effects. Research journals began publishing studies, including the provocative Kangaroo Care Modifies Preterm Infant Heart Rate Variability in Response to Heel Stick Pain: Pilot Study. Then someone got the idea of adding music. Researchers at several institutions in Taiwan combined forces to performed an experiment, documented in a 2006 paper, Randomised Controlled Trial of Music During Kangaroo Care on Maternal State Anxiety and Preterm Infants&apos; Responses, in the International Journal of Nursing Studies. The Taiwan experimenters had mothers and premature babies snuggle skin-to-skin while listening to recorded music emanated, for 60 minutes, from a Philips AZ-1103 ghetto-blaster. At the same time, other mothers and preemies neither snuggled skin-to-skin nor heard recorded music. The researchers found that the kangaroo&apos;ed babies slept a bit more than the non-kangaroo&apos;ed babies, and cried a bit less. And, they say, the kangarooing mothers gradually felt ever-so-slightly lessened anxiety. As for the babies&apos; health \u2013 the main reason people recommend kangaroo care \u2013 they reported &quot;no significant difference on infants&apos; physiologic responses&quot; between those who got kangarooing and music, and those who did not. The new Israeli kangaroo-plus-harp-music study also reports that their particular &quot;combined therapy had no apparent effect on the tested infants&apos; physiological responses or behavioural state&quot;. But a similar study \u2013 which the Israeli study does not mention \u2013 done in Finland and published online a year earlier by the Nordic Journal of Music Therapy reported that kangaroo therapy accompanied by live harp music &quot;did&quot; affect the medical state of the child. The Finns say that it &quot;decreased the pulse, slowed down the respiration and increased the transcutaneous O2 saturation&quot;, and &quot;affected the blood pressure significantly&quot;. And so doctors and nurses must await further research before they know the value of prescribing kangaroo care with live harp music.

That&apos;s what they want.&quot; That, in Shakespeare in Love&apos;s eyes, was the infallible formula for popular success, as Australia has recently been finding out. A kelpie/cattle-dog cross has made big eyes at everyone and become the star of 2011&apos;s homegrown box-office sensation, Red Dog. Based on the Louis de Berni\u00e8res novella and chronicling the real-life travels of a much-loved pooch through western Australia&apos;s Pilbara region in the 1970s, the film opened strongly on 11 August and continued building an audience on successive weekends. A four-legged fable has become a four-quadrant phenomenon: at the time of writing, it&apos;s taken A$13.7m ($14.4m), and was on the scent of the top 10 highest-grossing Australian films ever. No one likes to kick a dog, or the local hero, and the reviews have been mostly kind. &quot;When the market in family films is so thoroughly dominated by the wonders of CGI,&quot; wrote the Sydney Morning Herald&apos;s Sandra Hall, &quot;It comes as a cheering surprise to find one that makes such beguiling work out of an idea that goes all the way back to the adventures of Lassie and Rin Tin Tin.&quot; Jake Wilson, for the Age, was a touch pickier, pointing out Red Dog &quot;laid on the nostalgic populism with a trowel&quot;. But what&apos;s true for Elizabethan drama is true for gentle outback comedy, and the film currently stands 13th in the list of Aussie movies on home turf \u2013 just ahead of last year&apos;s, Tomorrow, When the War Began, and behind 2009&apos;s Mao&apos;s Last Dancer. What will be interesting is to see if Red Dog can learn the trick those two never did: to use a passport. The Guardian has actually given it a leg-up on the first leg of its journey abroad: our early review, of a screening at the London Australian film festival in May, helped secure it international distribution. It&apos;s released here over the winter, and with an estimated 118,000 Australians in the country (second only to Greece), then you can see why Red Dog&apos;s producers might want to kick off an international campaign here: a good haul could launch it with the momentum it needs to cross over. Diaspora box office has always been important as an extra source of cash. And in an increasingly intertwined world, there are more and more populous immigrant pockets in which these diaspora markets can bloom. Bollywood has targeted the NRI (non-resident Indian) demographic for a while now: Rs 977 ($212m) out of 10,900 crore ($2.3bn) in 2008 \u2013 so nearly 10% \u2013 was earned overseas. Egypt lucratively exports its cinema, as well as its citizens, to Jordan; the burgeoning Turkish film industry is beginning to make significant scores at the German box office. No one tallies whether expats or locals are the ones buying tickets to foreign releases in most countries, so it&apos;s difficult to break down what proportion of overseas sales are due to the diaspora dollar. But the possibilities keep on coming: the Japanese in Brazil, South Koreans in Japan, Nigerians in the UK, and so on. &quot;Nostalgic populism&quot; can actually be a good thing when courting the diaspora. It&apos;s been observed of Bollywood films that ex-pat audiences often go in for much more conservative portrayals of India than audiences back home; their memories, rather than present-day reality. The same was true \u2013 for much sharper political reasons \u2013 for Chinese exiles in postwar Taiwan: the 1963 musical melodrama Qi Cai Hu Bu Gui (The Love Eternal), with its fantasy version of the pre-communist motherland, was an enormous hit; it stuck with a young Ang Lee, who fed off it when he made Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. So Red Dog&apos;s throwback Aussie chops shouldn&apos;t be a problem. But a home-team following is just the first step. The whispering gallery of the 21st-century digital media means that the diaspora has great potential to be a platform to propel a film \u2013 especially if it&apos;s English-language \u2013 from local news to a marketable mainstream hit. What else does Red Dog need? The films immediately above it in Australia&apos;s all-time list are worth pondering (whereas the majority of the top 10 are at least partly US-backed extravaganzas by the likes of Baz Luhrmann and George Miller; and Crocodile Dundee is still so far ahead of the rest after 25 years, it looks like an unrepeatable freak). Muriel&apos;s Wedding  and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert were also the underdog real deals \u2013 gobby local films that had that extra something. Perhaps Muriel&apos;s Abba fixation and Priscilla&apos;s unlikely drag-queens-in-the-world&apos;s-most-macho-place were the crossover clinchers. Red Dog has the Louis de Berni\u00e8res factor \u2013 but we&apos;ll see how much more. A cute, furry face is good, but the tale \u2013 if it wants to be universal \u2013 needs to wag the dog. \u2022 What global box-office stories should we be writing about?

Quanta spokesman Elton Yang told the Taiwanese trade paper Digitimes that the company has cut staffing levels on its production lines in northern Taiwan by around 1,000 jobs to less than 2,000. However, he said that those who left had been contractors rather than full-time staff. While Yang would not confirm who its client is at the affected line, Fubon Securities analyst Arthur Liao said Quanta&apos;s Taiwan factory was specifically for Rim production, and that Quanta had shipped 1.5m PlayBooks in the first half. Figures released by RIM with its financial results for the quarter to the end of August showed that it shipped 200,000 of the 7in PlayBooks, and 500,000 in the three months before that. The rapid drop in shipments \u2013 and apparent lack of interest from buyers \u2013 means that it has had to cut back manufacturing. Orders to Quanta from Rim are reported to have dropped substantially as the company struggles to cope with the excess inventory. At its earnings call last week company executives hinted that they would begin price promotions over the next two quarters to get the devices into end-users&apos; hands.  Quanta&apos;s decision to cut staff and production suggests that Rim does not expect to clear its inventory before the end of its current financial year, which ends next May. An examination of RIM&apos;s balance sheet for the quarter shows that inventories \u2013 of stock in hand \u2013 have risen over the past six months, from $618m at the end of February before the PlayBook was launched, to $943m at the end of May when PlayBook shipments had just begun, to $1.372bn at the end of the latest quarter. While some of that inventory will include new BlackBerry 7 phones, it is likely that a substantial amount will be PlayBooks.  The component analyst IHS iSuppli reckons that the PlayBook has a bill of materials cost of $271, which would mean that 800,000 would add roughly $216m to Rim&apos;s inventory at cost price, the standard method for recording unsold stock. Unshipped PlayBooks would thus constitute about 15% by value of RIM&apos;s inventory. RIM had not returned a request for comment ahead of publication.  An examination by the Guardian of RIM&apos;s balance sheet dating back to 2002 shows that inventories have ballooned since the launch of the PlayBook, both in value and as a proportion of revenues, where they have reached a level not seen since the company was far smaller.

He suggested that Taiwan-based Acer Inc is expected to sell between 1.5m and 2m iConia tablets this year, short of its full-year target of 2.5m. Some tablet makers have struggled even while the iPad has thrived. HP discontinued its TouchPad device after it had been on sale for just over a month as the company changed strategic direction and decided to withdraw from making mobile devices, including tablets and smartphones. The company is now reported to be laying off staff from its webOS division which wrote the TouchPad software; more than 500 people are affected.  Even so the analysts IDC are optimistic about the prospects for tablets this year, forecasting that a total of 62.5m will be shipped to retailers and wholesalers. Update: RIM has confirmed that &quot;phones in the channel do not count as inventory on the balance sheet&quot; - which means that the rise in inventory does not include the 700,000 PlayBooks that have been shipped; instead it includes raw materials and finished goods still within RIM&apos;s control."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/21/new-band-exitmusic", "publicationDate": "2011-09-21T16:59:34Z", "tags": ["Indie", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Church and Palladino began writing together when Church moved to New York following a year teaching English in Taiwan and India."], "title": "New band of the day \u2013 No 1,110: Exitmusic", "article": "         Hometown: New York. The lineup: Aleksa Palladino (vocals), Devon Church (guitar, keyboards), Dru Prentiss (drums), Nicholas Shelestak (electronics). The background: Another day, another duo, also married. But Aleksa Palladino and Devon Church, who form the core of Exitmusic, have kept their own surnames because they each have their own careers. Palladino, the singer, has a thriving one: an actor since she was 14, when she co-starred alongside Scarlett Johansson in 1996 comedy drama Manny &amp; Lo, she&apos;s a member of the cast of Martin Scorsese&apos;s HBO series Boardwalk Empire, in which she plays bohemian artist Angela Darmody. And for the last couple of years she&apos;s also been part of Exitmusic, the drafting-in of drummer Dru Prentiss and electronics whiz Nicholas Shelestak adding ballast to what would have been a quieter, folkier affair. That&apos;s pure speculation on our part, by the way. Maybe we should stick to the facts. Church and Palladino began writing together when Church moved to New York following a year teaching English in Taiwan and India. He was a fan of Radiohead&apos;s Kid A, the second Sigur Ros album, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and Warp Records. Palladino, meanwhile, grew up in an artistic family, with painter grandparents and an opera singer mother. She got her first guitar aged 12 and her first four-track recorder soon after, so when she met Church it was inevitable that they would form a duo named after a Radiohead track, and turn her acoustic sketches into fuller pieces influenced by Icelandic and Canadian post-rock with electronic touches. The bit where they got married overlooking LA&apos;s Mulholland Drive was also, when you think about Exitmusic&apos;s noir energy and unsettling loveliness, pretty likely to happen. You can imagine a latterday Lynchian femme fatale singing these torrid melodramas in a darkly fantastical dream sequence. Well, we can, anyway. Recorded in Brooklyn, Exitmusic&apos;s From Silence EP explores &quot;themes of loss, both personal and universal, the destruction of nature and the destruction of our own nature&quot;. Nothing too ambitious. Then again, the video for the EP&apos;s lead track, the Sea, is a montage of footage from arthouse film legend Andrei Tarkovsky. The Sea is well titled: you will be engulfed, so dress accordingly. It&apos;s a tsunami of pop noise, and yes, it comes in waves. Palladino, the actor and rocker, further multitasks by providing the husky main part and the sighing backing vocal. On The Modern Age you can hear the Warp \u2013 or Radiohead do Warp \u2013 influence. Here, Palladino assumes the role of a wrecked torch singer on a song that we&apos;re duty-bound to inform you is every bit as good as the Strokes tune of the same title, her voice matching the rising instrumental tumult sob for weary sob. For second track The Hours she changes character again, going for something whispery and playfully Bj\u00f6rk-ish. Here, we&apos;re picturing her as a tragic servant girl in an old black-and-white Scandinavian film. Finally, The Silence is slow and sombre, like tribal music where the tribe are all on Mogadon, or trip-hop meets witch house, if we have to pigeonhole it, and we do. It&apos;s kind of a compulsion of ours. At one point, Palladino&apos;s vocal is almost \u2013 almost \u2013 Americana, before a chill descends and the music, and her voice, go somewhere else entirely: goth. She says that when she&apos;s writing a song, she becomes breathless, overwhelmed. We envisage the same thing happening to you when you hear the From Silence EP, but that&apos;s just us speculating again. The buzz: &quot;The freakishly talented duo of Aleksa Palladino and Devon Church always makes me think of two sweet kids strolling hand-in-hand into Armageddon&quot; \u2013 Los Angeles Citybeat. The truth: Think Beth from Portishead meets Warp-tinged Radiohead. Most likely to: Drown you in sound. Least likely to: Advertise Old Spice.

Founded in 1990, and funded by the Solheim family (owners of the Ping equipment company and generous supporters of women&apos;s golf through the years) the history of this contest between Europe&apos;s finest female players and their American counterparts is a history of bitterness interspersed with enmity and bad etiquette \u2013 as gleefully chronicled by John Huggan in Scotland on Sunday earlier this week. As Huggan writes: &quot;American Beth Daniel set the tone at Dalmahoy when she announced, Laura Davies apart, that none of the European side would have a sniff of making a US team that would, perhaps not coincidentally, go on to lose by five points. &quot;In 1994 \u2026 Dottie Pepper perpetrated an appalling breach of etiquette at the Greenbrier when she screamed &apos;yes!&apos; in the immediate aftermath of her opponent, the aforementioned Davies, missing a short putt. Four years later at Muirfield Village the European side \u2013 so irritated were they by the continued antics of Pepper \u2013 took turns bashing a &apos;Dottie dummy&apos; with a baseball bat.&quot; Pepper was at it again in 2007, albeit in her new guise as an American television commentator. After a poor performance on the opening morning in Sweden, the former US team stalwart was heard off-microphone describing the American players as &quot;choking freakin&apos; dogs&quot;. Needless to say, word filtered back to the US players, who after successfully winning the cup were quick to stick the knife into Pepper. Off-microphone, of course. The list of dust-ups goes on, with some of them making those infamous Ryder Cup spats between Paul Azinger and Seve Ballesteros look like friendly fall-outs. The response of golf&apos;s traditionalists, and indeed the tournament participants, is to play down such incidents, or at least argue that accentuating the negative is to demean the positive, by which they mean professional excellence of the players. Great golf is, of course, the third element necessary for a memorable team event. And when the 2011 edition of the Solheim tees up early on Friday at Killeen Castle golf course in Ireland we can expect some high quality golf over three days. There are some great players on both sides \u2013 Cristie Kerr and Paula Creamer for the US, and Suzann Pettersen for Europe to name three. But it is also the case that many of the game&apos;s best players, including the world No1 Yani Tseng of Taiwan (and 15 other players inside the top 25 of the world rankings), will be excluded by virtue of their nationality. So great women&apos;s golf will be on show in Ireland. But as for the very best that women&apos;s golf has to offer? Probably not. That will matter not one iota to the vocal, face-painted patriots who will make their way on to the Killeen Castle course, or even to the regular golf fans. But it should. These are difficult times for women&apos;s golf in the trans-Atlantic heartland, where power and money has resided for as long as the women&apos;s game has grown and thrived. Asia is the new power-house. That is not necessarily a bad thing, unless you are trying to attract sponsorship and television interest for the LPGA Tour in the United States and the Ladies European Tour on this side of the water. Nothing is forever in golf, so the balance may well shift in the future, especially if Lexi Thompson, the 16-year-old American who became the youngest winner in LPGA Tour history last weekend, develops into the dominant player everyone expects her to be. In the meantime, the trans-Atlantic golfing alliance needs a boost. The USA holds a 9-3 winning advantage in the Solheim contests, securing victories in the last three. One-sidedness is never good a thing in team events and it would certain not be a good thing this year. The good news from a European perspective is the teams look more evenly matched this time around. The USA line-up looks better in terms of the world rankings (it contains five of the world&apos;s top 20, compared to Europe&apos;s one, Pettersen) but recent form suggests the home team may be in better fettle. Eight Europeans have won tournaments this year, and four of the victories came on the LPGA tour. By contrast, the American contingent has only won twice on their home tour. Needless to say, the two captains, Rosie Jones of America and Alison Nicholas of Europe, have interpreted these statistics in a way that suits their own purposes. &quot;We definitely know this is going to be a hard fight. Europe has probably one of the strongest teams they&apos;ve had in a long time. We have a lot of respect for that. I have a lot of respect for Ali, and how she can captain the team, and expect our players to fight very hard to get another win,&apos;&apos; says Jones, seeking to paint her team as underdogs. &quot;We&apos;ve got great strength in depth, and it&apos;s a very strong European team. But I would never underestimate the Americans, because on paper in the world rankings, we are the underdogs slightly,&apos;&apos; says Nicholas. This pre-match back-and-forth is to be expected.

Finance ministers and central bankers from the group of 20 major economies meeting in Washington DC vowed on Thursday night, after a torrid day on stock markets, to take &quot;all steps necessary&quot; to calm the global financial system and said central banks stood ready to supply liquidity. The chancellor, George Osborne, was briefing reporters in Washington this lunchtime as politicians from the major countries sought to calm the markets. In another stomach-churning day for investors, most markets finally ended in positive territory. The FTSE 100 closed 25.20 points higher at 5066.81, having fallen as low as 4928.14, well below the psychological 5000 level. Despite the late rise, the leading index suffered its second worse weekly fall of the year so far, down 5.62%. European markets were equally unsettled, but Germany&apos;s Dax ended 0.6% higher while France&apos;s Cac rose 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 15 points by the time London closed. The late rally came following talk that France might be prepared to offer state help to its banks, weighed down as they are with Greek and Italian debt.. Shares had earlier turned negative in Europe after Deutsche Bank warned that European banks could take bigger writedowns than expected on Greek debt. Private sector creditors agreed in July to take a 21% loss on Greek bonds maturing before 2020 but the loss is more likely to be 25% or more, said Charlotte Jones, in charge of group controlling at Germany&apos;s biggest lender. The July agreement was based on a Greek government bond yield of 9%, but the yield has risen much further since then. &quot;Today, there are no Greek government bonds trading below yields of 13.75%,&quot; Jones told Reuters. &quot;In the event the private sector involvement is executed with market rates remaining above 9%, then, for every additional percentage point in market rate, the net present value haircut for investors will increase by a little over four percentage points.&quot; Markets were also plagued by recession fears after a fall in French consumer and business confidence in September, shrugging off a pledge from leaders of the G20 countries to step in to help financial markets. Manoj Ladwa, a senior trader at ETX Capital, also pointed to Germany&apos;s renewed rejection of euro bonds. &quot;That could have propped up the market. It&apos;s a no-no for the time being.&quot; His colleague, Mark Priest, added: &quot;I do not see how everything has changed overnight. Kickstarting the economy is easier said than done and it will take a lot more than what has been put on the table.&quot; G20 leaders had overnight indicated that the eurozone was working on bolstering the \u20ac440bn (\u00a3385bn) financial rescue fund. The communique from Washington said the bloc would implement &quot;actions to increase the flexibility of the EFSF [European Financial Stability Facility] and to maximise its impact&quot; by the eurozone&apos;s next ministerial meeting in October. Commodities continued their sell-off, with the London copper price hitting its lowest level in more than a year. It is on course for its steepest weekly loss since October 2008. Crude oil and gold edged higher but remain on track for their biggest weekly losses in more than a month. Gold appears to have lost some of its safe-haven appeal and is headed for the third week of decline. Meanwhile, David Cameron warned that the global economy was close to &quot;staring down the barrel&quot; and told eurozone leaders to stop &quot;kicking the can down the road&quot;. Gloomy economic assessments from the International Monetary Fund coupled with poor figures from the eurozone this week have stoked fears of a double-dip recession. Stock markets suffered heavy losses on Thursday, when global stocks entered bear market territory, and \u00a364bn was wiped off the value of blue-chip stocks in London. The FTSE 100 closed down 247 points, or 4.7%, at 5041, its biggest points fall since November 2008. In Asia, shares continued their slide on Friday. Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng was down 1.4% while the South Korean stock market lost 5.7% and shares in Taiwan fell 3.6%. Only the Indonesian market, which posted a near 9% drop on Thursday, the worst since 2008, bounced back by 1.7%. Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank, said: &quot;The statement from the G20 may have taken the edge off the current bitter market sentiment but the reassurances from the finance ministers lack substance. Until politicians back their words with actions in respect to moving closer to a solution to the eurozone debt crisis, markets will continue to worry about a messy and painful outcome from the eurozone debt crisis, and flight to quality is set to remain the order of the day.&quot; Two Greek newspapers reported that the Greek finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, had told lawmakers he saw three scenarios to resolve the debt crisis, including one where the country obtains an orderly default with a 50% haircut for bondholders. The other scenarios would be a disorderly default, or the implementation of a second \u20ac109bn (\u00a395bn) bailout plan agreed between Greece and its lenders in July. In a statement issued by the Greek finance ministry, Venizelos said: &quot;Greece has taken the final decision to do everything in its power in order for all the European Council decisions of 21 July, vital both for the euro area and for Greece itself, to be implemented fully and on time. &quot;All other discussions, rumours, comments and scenarios that distract attention from this central goal and political obligation of Greece, and of all the other euro area member states and European institutions, do not offer good service towards our common European case.&quot; Echoing Cameron&apos;s comments, former chancellor Norman Lamont said the world was &quot;teetering on the brink&quot;. While the global growth problems cannot be solved easily, &quot;the problem of Greece could be solved either by having a controlled default or bailing it out&quot;, he argued on the BBC&apos;s Today programme. &quot;The logic of currency unions is that the stronger countries help the weaker countries.&quot; But he was doubtful that this would happen soon. &quot;The crisis will just drag on and on, sapping confidence.&quot; Michael Hewson, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: &quot;The outlook for the European banking system remains highly uncertain, with downgrades for seven Italian banks, uncertainty over the next tranche of the Greek bailout, and an IMF report suggesting that the recent crisis in Europe suggests that the banks could be undercapitalised to the tune of \u20ac300bn and that politicians need to act now to avert a crisis.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/25/mark-thompson-met-guardian-order", "publicationDate": "2011-09-25T19:12:28Z", "tags": ["Mark Thompson", "Metropolitan police", "Police", "Milly Dowler", "UK news", "Phone hacking", "Privacy & the media", "Media law", "The Guardian", "News UK", "National newspapers", "Newspapers", "Newspapers & magazines", "BBC", "Ofcom", "Press Complaints Commission", "Media", "Press intrusion"], "sentences": ["In a speech in Taiwan on Sunday morning, Thompson said the affair was part of a &quot;disturbing trend&quot; for &quot;police forces in many parts of the UK routinely to demand that journalists disclose sources and hand over journalistic materials&quot;."], "title": "Mark Thompson: Met's order to Guardian part of 'disturbing trend'", "article": "The BBC director general has warned that British journalism is facing a &quot;dangerous period&quot; because of attempts by police to force news organisations to hand over confidential sources. Mark Thompson was speaking the week after Scotland Yard dropped its attempt to obtain a production order, which would have compelled the Guardian to disclose the source of a story revealing that a mobile phone belonging to Milly Dowler was hacked by the News of the World. In a speech in Taiwan on Sunday morning, Thompson said the affair was part of a &quot;disturbing trend&quot; for &quot;police forces in many parts of the UK routinely to demand that journalists disclose sources and hand over journalistic materials&quot;. He added: &quot;At the BBC, we receive an ever-growing number of demands for untransmitted news rushes which the police seem to regard as having no more privilege or protection attached to them than CCTV pictures.&quot; The police asked broadcasters to pass them footage of rioters in the summer, a request which most of them said they were happy to comply with providing the police obtained court orders requiring them to do so. Thompson said it was vital that good journalism carried out in the public interest is not damaged in the wake of the News of the World scandal, as lawmakers decide how to answer the questions it raises about newspaper ethics. He said: &quot;It would be easy to respond to the completely unacceptable actions of some journalists at the News of the World by adopting such a draconian approach that even the best journalism is constrained. &quot;It would be easy for concern over the appalling invasions of privacy revealed by the phone-hacking scandal to spill over into legislation or regulation which enables wrongdoers to escape journalistic exposure.&quot; Police investigating phone hacking had been due to attend a court hearing last Friday to pursue an application for a production order on the Guardian and reporter Amelia Hill requiring them to reveal the sources of the Dowler story. When it was published in July, it provoked a wave of public revulsion and lead to the resignations of several senior executives at Rupert Murdoch&apos;s News Corp media empire. The Met dropped the action after an outcry from newspapers and leading politicians. Thompson said: &quot;I can think of no better example of a journalistic disclosure being in the public interest than the Milly Dowler story in the Guardian. &quot;That anyone in the Metropolitan police should ever have thought otherwise is not only incomprehensible but disturbing.&quot; He also argued it would be wrong to respond to the hacking scandal by creating a single regulator to oversee all news organisations. He said he was &quot;sceptical of the view that newspapers should be regulated in the same way as broadcasters like the BBC who reach into every household in the land. &quot;Plurality of regulation is a good thing. One of the safeguards that broadcasters in the UK have is the presence of a far less regulated press which can draw attention to any attempt by the authorities or anyone else to misuse their powers when it comes to broadcasting. &quot;To put all journalism under a singled converged regulator would potentially mean that, if ever the state wished to limit media freedom, it would have a single lever with which to do so.&quot; Broadcasters must comply with a strict code enforced by Ofcom which requires their news coverage to be fair and balanced. Similar editorial guidelines are in place at BBC and overseen by the BBC Trust. Thompson argued the press should continue to regulate itself, and defended the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was lambasted by political leaders, including the prime minister and Ed Miliband for its failure to censure the News of the World. &quot;The current British model of self-regulation of the press is not to be dismissed out of hand,&quot; he said. &quot;The PCC has a good record in arbitrating complaints and disputes. The PCC was not established as a regulator as such and it is not reasonable to criticise it for not doing things it is not designed or empowered to do.&quot; The Leveson inquiry, which will begin taking evidence from witnesses next month, has been charged with recommending how the newspaper industry should be regulated in the future. The director-general added that the system of self-regulation should be radically reformed, however. &quot;In particular&quot;, he said, &quot;the self-regulatory body would have to be given the power to conduct unfettered investigations into complaints and, in cases where serious complaints are upheld, to impose fines or other sanctions on guilty parties&quot;. He said one possibility would be for Ofcom, which has the power to levy fines, to conduct inquiries into alleged wrongdoing at newspapers at the request of the press industry&apos;s own regulator. Thompson also said it was vital for the public interest to be properly defined if it is to be used to defend intrusion by the press and the use of techniques including subterfuge. &quot;The important thing is that the industry accepts a common definition so that, when we mount a public interest justification, everyone \u2013 courts, regulators, public \u2013 know that we are all talking about the same thing&quot;. Thompson also used the speech to attack newspapers who were initially reluctant to cover the phone-hacking story. &quot;Many national newspapers \u2013 and not just News International titles \u2013 showed a remarkable lack of interest in the phone-hacking story until it was simply too big to ignore&quot;, he said. &quot;Often there were more column inches attacking the BBC for its coverage of the story than there were on phone-hacking itself.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/sep/27/phone-hacking-theguardian", "publicationDate": "2011-09-27T11:21:07Z", "tags": ["Media", "Phone hacking", "The Guardian", "News of the World", "Reuters", "Mark Thompson", "Metropolitan police", "BBC", "News UK", "Taiwan", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Press intrusion"], "sentences": ["Guardian reporter Amelia Hill, who was questioned by the Met police over her phone-hacking revelations, was a panellist at the International Press Institute&apos;s congress in Taiwan yesterday."], "title": "Guardian reporter on the hacking threat to press freedom", "article": "Guardian reporter Amelia Hill, who was questioned by the Met police over her phone-hacking revelations, was a panellist at the International Press Institute&apos;s congress in Taiwan yesterday.

It certainly goes against much of the current international development agenda. For all their talk of &quot;best practices&quot;, donors are keen to distance themselves from the &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; approach they have been accused of adopting in the past, preferring instead to emphasise locality-specific solutions. But how else to explain the results of the research I carried out in Ethiopia and Kenya last year? Despite the vast historical differences between the two countries, leaders in both were remarkably eager to imitate other nations they saw as successful. Moreover, both groups looked to one region in particular: east Asia. &quot;In my head, I&apos;ve got practically everything mapped out \u2013 if you give me 10 years, I will give you South Korea,&quot; proclaimed one Kenyan technocrat. &quot;We are 20 years behind China,&quot; said an Ethiopian bureaucrat, &quot;and we&apos;re trying to do what they did to get where they are.&quot; These feelings are not just held privately, but make their way into policy and practice. Both Kenya&apos;s ambitious vision 2030 long-term development plan and Ethiopia&apos;s growth and transformation plan (pdf) draw heavily on similar concepts in Malaysia, Singapore and elsewhere in the region. All four foreign advisers on Kenya&apos;s key national planning body originate from east Asia, and pamphlets used to train cadres in Ethiopia&apos;s ruling party, the Ethiopian People&apos;s Revolutionary Democratic Front, use Taiwan, South Korea and China as examples of agricultural development and state intervention. Most senior decision makers I spoke to had visited the region several times on dedicated study trips, and such visits grow in number every year. Asia (and especially China&apos;s) new and much-heralded economic ties with Africa may certainly have something to do with this, but not as much as one might expect. If economic dependency were all that mattered, the EU - still the biggest trading partner of, and donor to, Ethiopia and Kenya - would surely rank first as the model to follow. Instead, many Africans view east Asia&apos;s development experiences as more replicable, in the medium term, than those of the west, which seem slow, remote and academic by comparison. Policymakers have seen, in their own lifetimes, how countries such as China and Singapore were able to &quot;come of age&quot; in a hostile international environment. So why shouldn&apos;t they, too, be able to turn things around? The lessons these governments draw from such models vary, but many hark back to principles that have become decidedly unpopular among mainstream western civil society and donors. Kenya and Ethiopia look at east Asia, and see the need for a strong and unifying national leadership that can transform and unite traditional communities into a new nation of &quot;modern&quot; citizens. This leadership is responsible for using the country&apos;s resources to build large and ambitious infrastructure projects, such as Ethiopia&apos;s controversial Gibe III dam. It oversees but does not control the economy, intervening directly where necessary to create globally competitive industries and sectors. It relies on advanced technology and double-digit economic growth to solve most of the country&apos;s problems. So important is this economic growth, in fact, that democracy is hardly possible without it; countries develop in stages, they point out, and cannot be expected to become democratic overnight. All of these lessons are a far cry from both the market-led approach of the Washington consensus, and from the participatory, flexible and community-led route advocated by its critics. Of course, Ethiopian and Kenyan leaders do not claim to use east Asia as an exact blueprint for development. There is much talk of adapting foreign models to local social, historical and cultural realities. Nor do the two countries draw identical lessons: Kenya&apos;s history of capitalism means that it looks to economically liberal countries such as Malaysia and Singapore, while Ethiopia&apos;s communist past makes it more comfortable with countries that have a history of strong state intervention, such as China and South Korea. Many other factors will continue to influence development in Africa \u2013 not least how successfully these lessons are actually adapted and applied. However, the fact that the east Asian model is so attractive to many African countries is bound to have profound implications for development practitioners. Western aid is not the only game in town anymore, and the global development agenda is no more immune from the influence of a rising Asia than the global economic system has turned out to be. Developing countries can now choose between an ever-growing variety of donors, trading partners, investors and development strategies. Whether or not we agree with the models they pick - or even with the idea of a development &quot;model&quot; at all - we would do well to listen to and engage with these views. There&apos;ll be no point in trying only to reform and improve western aid if the real debate is happening somewhere else. \u2022 Elsje Fourie is a doctoral candidate at the school of international studies, University of Trento, Italy.

An initial step would be for companies to make a concerted effort to adopt a few fabrics that are more sustainable but which may cost 5-10% more in base price. This would cause a chain reaction in the rest of industry. As big brands source more responsible textiles for their collections, there will be a bigger volume of orders which will lower the overall manufacturing cost (and therefore retail price), making the product more accessible to the mainstream market. Brands and retailers need to work with their suppliers to understand what the problems are and how they can be improved. Many suppliers are based in the developing world so most factories do not have good environmental or social management systems in place. The two major hotspots in the life-cycle of a garment are raw materials and use phase (washing and drying). Dealing with sustainable raw materials is key and this means working down the entire supply chain. Whilst most big brands understand this, getting to grips with extended global supply chains can be very difficult. How can companies increase sustainability throughout their supply chains? In order to implement systemic change, there must first be a market for sustainable products, and currently that is quite small. Companies need to heighten customer awareness of where clothing comes from, how it is made and the social and environmental impact of its production. One panellist commented that there is a market for sustainability but currently consumers just don&apos;t know enough. The first step is internal transparency. Blood, Sweat and T-shirts, the BBC Three series, showed that a lot of brands did not know where their clothing originates from or how it was made. It is crucial to run through the supply chain to ensure sustainable practice is embraced across the board and to communicate this within the company. If this is not done, how can brands communicate sustainable values to their customers? Address the issue of raw material production. This area presents a big challenge to the industry because the use of raw materials is at the bottom of the supply chain and is the least visible process. It also includes a range of industries from agriculture (cotton and linen) to oil extraction to refining (polyester and nylon). A good example of a company addressing this is Marks &amp; Spencer which has recently committed to complete supply-chain transparency for all non-food products. Any solutions will be reliant on traceability in the supply chain, and must be applicable to developing world contexts. For smaller brands and retailers it will be difficult to make an impact as suppliers will need to be convinced of the benefits of investing in new technology and processes that are not easily visible. Can collaboration help? Sharing best practices is a key element for change in the industry. Sharing knowledge is critical because the clothing industry is very complex and there is not just one answer. Only through collaboration at different stages of the supply chain we can find solutions. How can brands bring ethical fashion into the mainstream? While there are some super-premium ethical fashion brands, the market lacks stylish, affordable clothes from well-known high-street brands. One of the problems is that many ethical fashion companies do not get the exposure of the big, non-ethical brands because they cannot afford PR representation which is the engine house of the fashion industry. This means while there may be editors and stylists who would like some of the ethical fashion being produced, they are not exposed to it in the same way they are to big labels. The Mintel report in 2009 showed that some consumers would buy ethical fashion if prices were lower. However others said they would not trust cheap ethical fashion. An example of this was when Sainsbury&apos;s converted their basic T-shirts to Fairtrade cotton a few years ago but kept the same selling price as conventional T-shirts. Customers did not believe the company and thought the T-shirts were not made from Fairtrade cotton. Tesco applied the same sourcing strategy the year before but placed its selling price 50p higher and received only positive feedback from customers. What steps are being made across the apparel industry to encourage people to value quality and longevity over quantity and trends? Mainstream retailers saw a &quot;flight to quality&quot; during the last recession. This means customers moving away from the cheaper, value products to more design-led and added-value pieces. This could be an interesting way of moving mainstream fashion to more sustainable sources if we can demonstrate real design value in ethical alternatives. Hermes have put the concept of slow fashion at the heart of their brand ethos. One panellist commented that while it is at the luxury end of the fashion spectrum and is inaccessible to the majority of people, it is interesting to see that their profits have been soaring in the last few years. Other examples of best practice in swimming against the fast fashion tide are: \u2022 Luxury group PPR&apos;s commitment to sustainability \u2022 Futerra&apos;s clothes swapping initiative, Swishing. \u2022 The Uniform Project, where one woman wore the same dress for 365 days. Is organic cotton a sustainable solution? There are a whole range of viewpoints on organic cotton with the most controversial being that farming cotton, organic or not, is not a sustainable option due to water availability. With many man-made fibres starting to mimic the touch, feel and handle of organic cotton, we will start to see cotton production levels falling and replacement fibres taking centre stage. The WWF recently produced a report on cotton highlighting the work done by the Better Cotton Initiative and the wider issues surrounding cotton production. The report champions the idea of brands adopting a project to improve an aspect of their own cotton process \u2013 this could be from sourcing to ethical production or environmental impact. Adopting more than one fibre type Made-by has created an environmental benchmark for fibres which compares 23 fibres and ranks them on their sustainability impact. The organisation works with brands to develop a sustainable fibre strategy, swapping less sustainable fibres for those that are more sustainable. An example of good practice is H&amp;M which is considering bringing Newlife, a new high-tech, recycled polyester that is made in a closed loop system, into its range. This is a commercially viable option at a cost-effective price. The fabric is engineered from post-consumer bottles sourced and processed solely in Italy and boasts a unique local supply chain. It is a good example of how standard polyesters can be slowly removed from the marketplace for a more sustainable option. There are several good initiatives working at fibre level including Fairtrade, Cotton Made in Africa, BCI, and Ecolabel in Taiwan. The challenge for big brands is getting these into their supply chains, tracking it through each stage to ensure it ends up in their finished products. This is achievable but involves a lot of commitment and fluent communication to involve everyone in the chain. How can brands communicate sustainable approaches to consumers? M&amp;S is a leader in terms getting the message of its sustainability strategy out to the public but there are also other big brands doing some really interesting things. For example, Nike&apos;s apparel eco index has now been released as open source. The company has also integrated its sustainability team into its business innovation lab with the ethos of &quot;business as normal&quot;. Puma are well known for its Clever Little Bag campaign, getting rid of shoe boxes and using a reusable bag instead. The sports company is also working on product development with eco scorecards and converting more of their range to sustainable materials, including cotton made in Africa. It is key for a brand to find an appropriate product and lexicon to communicate their approach to sustainability, The 132 5 Issey Miyake collection is a good example of sustainable practice being incorporated within the existing brand values. The best way for a company to tell its sustainability, ethics and responsibility story, while staying true to its values and heritage, is to start with answering the question &quot;why?&quot;. See Simon Sinek&apos;s Ted Talk. How can companies change consumer behaviour? One panellist said that some of the best examples have come from the laundry sector. Procter &amp; Gamble&apos;s Ariel Turn to 30 campaign has been successful in raising awareness around washing at lower temperatures to save money as has Persil&apos;s Small and Mighty washing product which is designed to clean in 30 minutes. There have also been encouraging examples in the apparel industry with Patagonia developing closed loop recycling for their fleeces and Tesco&apos;s collection and redistribution of used school uniforms through British Red Cross a few years ago. Panellists agreed that we must look at the psychology that lies behind consumption issues as these are at the route to many of the sustainability challenges facing the fashion industry. We need to address our own desire for more disposable items rather than just produce the same amount but in a more sustainable way. How can businesses work with suppliers to increase sustainability? Panellists agreed that talking to suppliers is key to getting internal transparency. One panellist said that in her experience suppliers are quite knowledgeable and enthusiastic about traceability and sustainable materials. If a business has an existing supply chain, a life-cycle-wide assessment of the overall impact might help identify the weakest areas in the chain. An initiative such as the Sustainable Apparel Coalition&apos;s could help identify what issues to start chipping away at. It is important to establish longer-term relationships with suppliers. The fashion industry is notorious for chopping and changing its suppliers according to price, but in order to work with suppliers effectively, and to ensure green codes are effectively deployed in factories, longer-term relationships are needed. What comes next for the fashion industry? One of the major trends will be securing resources, raw materials, energy and water to run factories. Cotton prices have gone up over the last 12 months with factories in Bangladesh suffering four or five power cuts every day. With rising energy and water bills all over the world, even the big brands will struggle with these issues. Companies should see these challenges as an opportunity for more sustainable designs. The sector will face even tougher competition as suppliers from emerging countries establish their own brands and export to international markets in parallel with their work as contractors. New rules must be set and a common and clearer understanding about what is and is not sustainable is needed. Key issues are: \u2022 Consumer behaviour change \u2013 especially in how we clean and dispose of clothes. \u2022 Making sustainable development desirable. \u2022 Climate change adaptation \u2013 as the planet&apos;s temperature changes, consumers needs from clothes will change.

The first winner - the former Taiwanese vice-president Lien Chan - failed to turn up to the chaotic inaugural ceremony. His office appeared to be unaware that the event was taking place. This generated a contrast with Liu, who was represented by an empty chair\u00a0at the Nobel ceremony because he is in prison on subversion charges after promoting a more democratic form of government. His wife is under tight supervision and frequent house arrest. Beijing is furious at Liu&apos;s high-profile award and accuses hostile foreign forces of trying to undermine its economic success. Some in the media compared China&apos;s rival award to the Nazi&apos;s creation of the German National Prize for Art and Science in 1935 in a fit of pique at a Nobel snub. It is unclear whether a new award will replace the defunct Confucius prize. To counter what it sees as an unfair international reputation, the government in Beijing has ramped up its attempts to project &quot;soft power&quot;. Along with Confucius institutes to promote Chinese culture, it has invested heavily in the foreign coverage of state-run media, such as the Xinhua news agency and China Central Television."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/oct/03/alma-universe-secrets-astronomers", "publicationDate": "2011-10-03T09:30:00Z", "tags": ["Astronomy", "Space", "Science", "Chile", "World news", "Americas"], "sentences": ["We think that some of the gas may be escaping its grip, at close to the speed of light.&quot; Alma is a collaboration between the 15 member countries of the European Southern Observatory with the US, Japan, Chile, Taiwan and Canada."], "title": "Alma will reveal secrets of the universe previously hidden to astronomers", "article": "     The Chajnantor plateau, 5,000 metres above sea level in the Chilean Andes, is one of the most inhospitable places on Earth. The thin air makes breathing difficult, there is no water in sight and fierce winds often force the temperature down to 20C (68F) below freezing. On this desolate, Mars-like terrain, however, the world&apos;s most expensive and sophisticated observatory has just stirred into life. The Atacama Large Millimetre/Sub-millimetre Array (Alma) will open astronomers&apos; eyes to the half of the universe that has, until now, been hidden to modern telescopes. It can already peer through the distant clouds of dust and debris in which the earliest stars, galaxies and planets were made and, when it is fully operational in 2013, the observatory will find a previously unseen galaxy every three minutes. &quot;When a star forms, it forms in these cold, dusty gas clouds,&quot; said John Richer of the University of Cambridge and a project scientist for Alma. &quot;The moment it&apos;s formed it&apos;s shrouded in this dusty material, out of which only half of the light from a typical star escapes. Many other stars are formed in very dense clouds and their light is completely absorbed by the dust in these clouds.&quot; These soot-like clouds of dust, which are also the birthplace of planets like the Earth, obscure stars from modern optical and infrared equipment, such as the Hubble Space Telescope. While the dust hides the stars, however, it also gets heated by the starlight to a few degrees above absolute zero (-273C). The dust then emits radiation of its own at sub-millimetre wavelengths, which can be detected on Earth by Alma. Sub-millimetre light waves are similar to the radiation used by microwave ovens and 1,000 times longer than the light we see with our eyes. Detecting these means that astronomers will be been able to build a more complete picture of the universe. &quot;If you combine the optical images with the [Alma] images you reveal all the star-forming activity, you&apos;re not missing half of the picture,&quot; says Richer. Astronomers picked the inhospitable Andean site for their new observatory because it has year-round clear skies and is one of the driest places in the world. Sub-millimetre radiation is absorbed by water and there has been no rain in parts of the Atacama desert for many hundreds of years. An advantage of being so high up is that Alma will be able to capture images as sharp as anything of which Hubble is capable. Shifts of astronomers control the dishes from a more hospitable base at more than a thousand metres below the Chajnantor plateau. After more than two decades of design and construction, Alma opened for the use of astronomers around the world this week. Sitting in the desert plateau are 20 identical radio antennas, each one 12 metres in diameter. When the \u20ac1bn (\u00a3860m) observatory is complete in two years, it will have 66 of the carbon-fibre antennas, which can be arranged in countless configurations, up to 10 miles apart across the mountains, depending on the measurements astronomers want to make. &quot;Alma has got such a fantastic increase in sensitivity compared to previous sub-millimetre wave telescopes, we&apos;re expecting that, every three minutes that Alma is observing the sky, it will discover one brand new galaxy somewhere in the universe,&quot; said Richer. Despite being incomplete, the observatory has already started doing science. The first scientific image, taken by measurements from 16 of the dishes installed on the Chajnantor site, shows the violent swirls of the Antennae galaxies, a pair of distorted spiral galaxies that are in the process of colliding about 70m light years from Earth. The blue colours represent the best quality optical image taken of this region of space so far, by the Hubble Space Telescope. The red, pink and yellow show previously unseen wavelengths of light emanating from the vast carbon monoxide clouds that float in and between the galaxies, imaged by Alma for the first time. These clouds contain gases with a total mass several billion times that of our sun and, as such, are a reservoir for the formation of future stars. Among the other experiments chosen for the first year of Alma operations is studying the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*, which is 26,000 light years from Earth. Dense gas and dust clouds normally obscure the black hole but Alma will be able to see through them. Heino Falcke, an astronomer at Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, said: &quot;Alma will let us watch flares of light coming from around this supermassive black hole, and make images of the gas clouds caught by its immense pull. This will let us study this monster&apos;s messy feeding habits. We think that some of the gas may be escaping its grip, at close to the speed of light.&quot; Alma is a collaboration between the 15 member countries of the European Southern Observatory with the US, Japan, Chile, Taiwan and Canada. The UK contribution, funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council, includes detectors and design input from Cambridge, Kent and Manchester Universities, and construction of the cooling systems in the radio antennae at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire. &quot;Projects like Alma require an enormous amount of patience \u2013 many of us have been working on this for more than a decade,&quot; said Gary Fuller, of the University of Manchester. &quot;There have been many obstacles to be overcome, but I&apos;ve no doubt that it will all be worth it \u2013 it&apos;s great to see the first scientific observations beginning for astronomers from the UK and around the world.&quot; Alma in numbers Height of observatory above sea-level: 5,000 metres Number of radio antennae when Alma is complete: 66 Total collecting area: up to 7,240 metres squared Computing power: 17 quadrillion operations per second (1.7x10^16) Project cost: \u20ac1bn Countries involved: 20 \u2022 This article was amended on 4 October 2011.

Only just over half of the time I spend &apos;working&apos; is with the children - spend far too many evenings and weekends working which leads to stress and problems in home life. Yes, we get great holidays, but you have to get through the term time with your sanity, health and relationships in tact first, in order to enjoy them. Besides, how many teachers spend their holidays ill and recovering from the overwhelming exhaustion of the term?      I entered the profession in my early 50s after a 30 year career in IT. It&apos;s the hardest job I have ever had. There is an excessive amount of work to do and that would be even worse if shortcuts were not the order of the day. Further, there are too many classes to teach, there is not enough &apos;free&apos; time and, what there is, is too fragmented. There is too much &apos;telling teachers what they must do&apos; and not enough &apos;asking teachers what they need&apos;. In particular, I&apos;ve noticed how little teachers express their opinions, in for example, the press: fear of saying something out of turn?      Every day is stressful, not knowing whether one will still have a job at the end of it. If a child dislikes a teacher and complains for no reason or fabricates an incident, the culture seems to be that the teacher is guilty. No action is ever taken against the child and one can expect to be made to continue their teaching. Job security is virtually non-existent. Furthermore, as a male teacher the chances of living to claim any pension at all are slim to say the least, especially with present proposals for pensions and stats showing life expectancy within the &apos;profession&apos;. It is also virtually impossible to own a house and maintain any reasonable standard of living on the salary provided. I feel the commitment, stress and expected dedication within the profession merit a reasonable standard of living. Constant interference by unqualified government officials raises stress levels, increases workload and wastes public money, at the same time weakening support for teachers. We are THE political &apos;brickbat&apos; every time there&apos;s an election. I like my job but there is no way I would go into teaching now if I were just starting out.      The hours required to be an effective teacher are too much - this may get better as I gain more experience. Also expected to teach other subjects not trained in or know very little about up to A-level puts too much pressure on teachers.      If teachers were allowed more non-contact time (e.g. 2 free lessons a day) then this would be the best job in the world. As it is most teachers who are considered exceptional are those who work every evening in the week and most of the Sunday. This is unacceptable.      My husband and I both left our teaching jobs in East London five years ago for positions abroad. We currently work in a globally recognised IBO world school in Thailand. My answers to this survey reflect the job and sentiments I had during my last year in the UK. Previous to working in the UK I had worked in Canada and Taiwan at both state and public schools. I thought I&apos;d seen it all until I moved to the UK. I was wrong. My husband was considering leaving the profession after only three years teaching until I convinced him to move abroad. As he once said, he was on the verge of losing his &apos;gallows humour&apos;. Since leaving England, I can happily report that we have both rediscovered our joy of teaching. In fact, we realised that we were doing at the large comprehensive we taught in wasn&apos;t so much teaching as it was crowd control. We probably work longer hours where we are now but we are much better off financially, emotionally and the time we do put into our teaching and learning is valued and respected by students and parents alike. Now that&apos;s what I call value added!      I enjoy my job- the children make it worthwhile. However I can&apos;t stand the endless paperwork, I feel my own family lose out as a result of time spent working in the evenings and my stress levels. I also dislike the endless observing of children in the early years as I then don&apos;t seem to have time to reach!"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2011/oct/04/join-amazon-tablet-analyst", "publicationDate": "2011-10-04T13:58:29Z", "tags": ["Tablet computers", "Amazon.com", "Kindle Fire", "Technology", "iPad"], "sentences": ["Among those which say they will not be cutting prices are Asustek, which told the Taiwan trade paper Digitimes that it would not be cutting the price of its Eee Pad Transformer, nor the second-generation version, also expected to sell at $499 - the same entry price as the iPad."], "title": "Android tablet makers: join up with Amazon or you'll lose, says analyst", "article": "Makers of Android tablets should throw their lot in with Amazon rather than Google to avoid being squeezed out of the market by the internet retailer and Apple&apos;s iPad, says Richard Windsor, technology securities analyst at Nomura International. Amazon&apos;s announcement of the 7in Kindle Fire, presently slated for US release in November, is expected to galvanise the lower-priced tablet market, and offer a challenge to Apple that none of the existing tablets based on Google&apos;s Android have. Amazon however is not using a Google-authenticated version of Android, but its own &quot;fork&quot; of the mobile operating system which does not include the search engine giant&apos;s services.  &quot;The main effect of the potential sea change triggered by Amazon could be a change in roadmap to cheaper products or possible tie-ups with Amazon,&quot; Windsor says in a research note issued on Tuesday morning. &quot;With the advent of the Amazon Kindle Fire, many of the other tablet makers are in a bit of a quandary as they are left with expensive tablets without a comprehensive content offering.&quot; But for existing tablet makers to start shifting over to Amazon would threaten Google&apos;s strategy in the market, where it wants to get its services as widely used as possible. Though Google is the default search engine on the Kindle Fire, some believe that Google has had to pay for the position - rather than having it by default, as happens on other Android tablets. Windsor says that there is &quot;a real possibility that the existing tablet makers [will] team up with Amazon and offer its experience on their hardware. But, in the meantime, they seem to be remaining resolute, stating that they have no intention of cutting prices.&quot; He suggests that keeping prices high is &quot;living in denial&quot;.  Among those which say they will not be cutting prices are Asustek, which told the Taiwan trade paper Digitimes that it would not be cutting the price of its Eee Pad Transformer, nor the second-generation version, also expected to sell at $499 - the same entry price as the iPad. Asustek&apos;s chief executive Jerry Shen said that the company was sticking with its forecast that it will ship between 1.5m and 2m tablets for 2011, having shipped 1m in the first three quarters of the year. He suggested that Android 4.0, known as &quot;Ice Cream Sandwich&quot; and expected at the end of this year, would improve Android competitiveness with the iPad.  Shen forecast that the Kindle Fire will take &quot;20-30%&quot; of tablet shipments - though he didn&apos;t specify whether that was for Android, or included the iPad. He said though that 10in screens will still be the mainstream specification. But Windsor thinks that if Asustek shifts its ground, it could benefit. &quot;If content dominates the user experience, then industrial design will become even more important, which puts Asustek in an even better position to gain share than before.&quot; Windsor has a &quot;buy&quot; rating on Asustek, but says that in the PC space &quot;we remain very cautious overall.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/oct/04/barack-obama-foreign-policy-presidency", "publicationDate": "2011-10-04T16:14:00Z", "tags": ["Obama administration", "Barack Obama", "US politics", "US foreign policy", "Afghanistan", "Egypt", "Iraq", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Nuclear weapons", "South and Central Asia"], "sentences": ["Along the Pacific rim, meanwhile, widely shared perceptions of a lack of political resolve in the face of China&apos;s military expansionism are fuelling an arms race from Taiwan and Malaysia to Vietnam and Australia."], "title": "On the world stage, Obama the idealist has taken fright | Simon Tisdall", "article": "Candidates run on hope. Incumbents run on their record. But Barack Obama, lining up for a second term at the White House next year, has little to offer on either score. The heady optimism of 2008 has dissipated. At home, Obama is primarily associated with hard times: only 34% of voters approve of his handling of the economy, according to a recent poll. Abroad, his presidency has come to stand for impotence and incompetence. He promised new beginnings; what he has delivered, for the most part, is waffle, dither and drift. If this verdict seems harsh, take a quick tour round the globe. Everywhere the pillars of American superpower are crumbling. The old habit of hegemony, formed in the postwar decades and confirmed in 1989 as Soviet power imploded, is fading as fast as a Honolulu sunset. Part of the explanation is faltering industrial and financial clout, reflecting the rapid rise of rivals like China and India. But that is compounded by another central element: Obama&apos;s persistent failure to stand up, in practical, substantive ways, for the values, beliefs and interests he so eloquently espouses. Obama&apos;s early, anguished indecision over keeping his promise to close Guant\u00e1namo Bay now looks like a grim portent. So, too, does his administration&apos;s failure to support the Iranian students whose &quot;green revolution&quot; was so cruelly suppressed in Tehran in 2009. When the Arab spring took hold this year, the man who in Cairo had preached the pre-eminence of the democratic ideal took fright. Tunisia did not matter much. But when he faced accusations of becoming the president who &quot;lost&quot; Egypt, Obama&apos;s dither default setting was triggered anew. In the event he achieved the worst of all worlds. Hosni Mubarak, that staunch, unlovely friend of the west, was deposed with Washington&apos;s belated blessing \u2013 to the lasting mortification of another key American ally, Saudi Arabia. Now the army-led, supposedly caretaker regime that replaced him appears equally unappealing. Egypt may soon require a second revolution, and next time the Islamists may not act so coy. For its part, Riyadh absorbed the lesson of US unreliability and took matters into its own hands by crushing dissent in Bahrain. In Libya, as elsewhere, Obama talked the good fight from the sidelines. Speaking about Syria in August, he condemned President Bashar al-Assad&apos;s &quot;imprisoning, torturing and slaughtering&quot; of pro-democracy demonstrators and demanded he step aside immediately. The call came after months of White House debate about the consequences of supporting change in Damascus. Assad, meanwhile, contemptuously ignores US mouthings, and a fracturing Syria accelerates towards the abyss. Obama&apos;s handling of his legacy wars \u2013 Afghanistan and Iraq \u2013 provides little to crow about on the stump. The Afghan troop surge has not brought about the looked-for breakthrough. Instead, casualties are up, while the Taliban, in contrast, have increasingly resorted to targeted terror tactics \u2013 such as last month&apos;s assassination of Burhanuddin Rabbani, a former Afghan president and head of the high peace council. Any examination of whether Obama and his diplomats and commanders want a negotiated Afghan peace settlement finds President Dither at his most infuriating. Speaking at the end of Ramadan, Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, clearly signalled interest in pursuing talks to create a new political order acceptable to all Afghans. But Washington seems more intent on threatening Pakistan than ensuring a peaceful transition in Afghanistan after 2014. Much the same may be said of Iraq, where US concerns focus less on the stability of a country it so massively destabilised than on how Iran may exploit the US withdrawal. Obama&apos;s foreign policy under-achievement leaves a global trail. He spoke out forcefully in Prague about the necessary inevitability of a nuclear bomb-free world. But his carrots and sticks have had little impact on North Korea&apos;s or Iran&apos;s ambitions, while the Libyan war delivered a clear message: if Muammar Gaddafi had not abandoned his nuclear weapons programme in 2003 he might still be in power now. As a candidate Obama condemned Russia&apos;s 2008 invasion of Georgian territory. But as president he offered Vladimir Putin&apos;s regime a &quot;reset&quot; of relations amounting to a reward for bad behaviour. Along the Pacific rim, meanwhile, widely shared perceptions of a lack of political resolve in the face of China&apos;s military expansionism are fuelling an arms race from Taiwan and Malaysia to Vietnam and Australia. Amid multiple disappointments, one dismaying act of expediency stands out: Obama&apos;s open-ended threat to veto UN recognition of a Palestinian state. After the three-year runaround handed out by Israel&apos;s last-ditcher, &quot;no surrender&quot; prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, Obama had the chance to deliver a symbolic blow for peace, something surely right up his street. But with a wary eye on the 2012 campaign, he just couldn&apos;t do it. Under Obama, the empire does not strike back. It strikes out. If Obama is re-elected it won&apos;t be due to his international achievements \u2013 unless you think killing Osama bin Laden is worth another four years."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/05/australia-strategic-relations-china", "publicationDate": "2011-10-05T21:30:01Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Australia news", "US foreign policy", "US domestic policy", "US news", "Financial crisis", "Global recession", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["China&apos;s growth has indeed not been matched by any expansionist tendencies beyond reuniting Taiwan."], "title": "Australia: a friend to two giants | Malcolm Turnbull", "article": "The rise of China is a massive realignment of economic and, in due course, political and strategic power at a speed and on a scale the world has not seen before. According to the International Monetary Fund&apos;s forecasts it will overtake the United States as the world&apos;s largest economy in 2016. Others argue it has already done so. There are a few nations with a sense of cultural continuity and exceptionalism that rival China&apos;s, but none rival its scale. China sees itself as a 3,000-year culture, for almost all modern history the world&apos;s largest and strongest country. Resource security (energy, minerals and food) is a growing preoccupation of Beijing. Its rush to acquire access to natural resources, including in Australia, is entirely understandable. And the financial crisis offers great opportunities for a cash-rich China to acquire as many premium resource assets as it can, so that it emerges with a global portfolio of sufficient scale and diversity to secure long-term, low-cost access to all the resources it needs. So China represents a challenge to the US that is utterly unique. Americans, have assumed that they will always be the strongest, richest and cleverest nation on earth. Tom Friedman and Michael Mandelbaum&apos;s book, That Used to Be Us, is eloquent testimony to a growing sense of inadequacy. This sense of being outclassed by China is not limited to Americans. Nobody who has visited Shanghai could be unimpressed. To many in the west, as worrying as the shift of manufacturing and economic output to Asia are the transfers of political, institutional and military influence that will surely follow. And international institutions are changing to reflect that \u2013 the G20 is one example. Shifts in economic weight and military potential are a legitimate cause for anxiety, as the world&apos;s grim 20th-century history reminds us. Previous threats to more than a century of American economic primacy were not credible: the USSR of the late 50s and the Japan of the late 80s, the two alleged challengers, had economies only 40% as large. So the stakes are high, and this time the challenger is real. And there is also strategic anxiety in the US over China, reflecting a concern that China has a very different understanding of the way in which world affairs should be ordered than the west. While ever alert, we should not be alarmed, says Henry Kissinger, who argues that China&apos;s well-developed and historic sense of its central place will make it a less outwardly assertive leading power than the US. China&apos;s growth has indeed not been matched by any expansionist tendencies beyond reuniting Taiwan. The central role of trade in China&apos;s prosperity also argues for its rise to remain peaceful. At 55% of its GDP in 2010, it has more to lose than most from any conflict that disrupts global economic flows. The best and most realistic strategic outcome for east Asia must be one in which the powers are in balance, with each side effectively able to deny the domination of the other. With its energy and resource security depending on long global sea lanes, it is hardly surprising that China would seek to enhance its naval capacity, so suggestions that China&apos;s recent launch of one aircraft carrier and plans to build another are signs of a new belligerence are wide of the mark. It makes no sense for the US or its allies to base long-term strategic policy on the proposition that they are on an inevitable collision course with a militarily aggressive China. I disagree with the underlying premise of a 2009 Australian white paper that we should base our defence planning on the contingency of a naval war with China in the South China Sea. Prejudice is not a substitute for coolly rational analysis. China needs to be more transparent about its goals in the region and build confidence with its neighbours so that misunderstandings can be avoided. We in Australia have to adopt a clear-eyed appraisal of the strategic balance in east Asia. America is our closest ally. However, as China rises to become the world&apos;s largest economy and in time a military rival to the US we are presented with a nation whose institutions and culture are very different to ours. Yet China is our largest trading partner and in large measure responsible for our current and prospective prosperity. We have every reason, and indeed every prospect, of remaining close and becoming closer friends of both these giants."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/07/reamde-neal-stephenson-miller-review", "publicationDate": "2011-10-07T21:55:06Z", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "Thrillers"], "sentences": ["From there, the book&apos;s formidably energetic narrative fans out across the globe, encompassing Seattle&apos;s hi-tech enclave, a Missouri trailer park, Trinity College, Cambridge, a Chinese boomtown, Taiwan, the Philippines and parts of the South China Sea, before contracting back to the flinty territory where it began \u2013 only this time with even more guns."], "title": "Reamde by Neal Stephenson \u2013 review", "article": "Neal Stephenson&apos;s new novel begins with a family reunion in the Idaho panhandle, near the Canadian border, during which the &quot;reserved, even hardbitten&quot; men of the extended Forthrast clan engage in shooting practice with an impressive assortment of firearms.

Along its trajectory, the novel acquires Russian gangsters, a Hungarian hacker, a Chinese video gamer, a British spy and, for its antagonist, a Welsh national of Caribbean descent leading a team of jihadis intent on committing acts of spectacular terrorism in the US. That&apos;s not all; while the preceding description just about covers the real-world action in Reamde, portions of the book take place in an imaginary but immensely complex world called T&apos;Rain, the creation of Richard Forthrast, wilderness guide turned pot smuggler turned online video game billionaire. It&apos;s in T&apos;rain that all the trouble starts, with a virus called Reamde. Like Stephenson&apos;s most critically acclaimed novel, Cryptonomicon, Reamde combines meticulous observation of the stranger socioeconomic effects wrought by technology with rousing fusillades of adventure. In any given chapter, you might learn how Richard designed the massively multiplayer T&apos;Rain from the ground up as a money-laundering system in which real cash can be converted to virtual gold and back again. Or how rich, impatient westerners who can&apos;t be bothered to build up their game characters&apos; experience points from scratch buy pre-empowered avatars from Chinese teenagers camped out in vast wangbas (internet bars) filled with computers rented by the hour. After that, you might race through a breathless account of how Richard&apos;s niece, Zula (adopted from an Eritrean orphanage), nearly escapes from the Russian mobsters who have kidnapped her and her boyfriend by removing a drainpipe and climbing up through the ceiling tiles of the skyscraper where she&apos;s being held captive. Zula, like just about every character in Reamde, is remarkably resourceful, levelheaded and competent; most of these people make MacGyver look like the guy who calls IT because he can&apos;t figure out how to power up his external hard drive. Although Stephenson is careful to explain how each character acquired this or that bit of acutely relevant expertise, strictly speaking, the sum of their exploits cannot be called realistic. As the novel careens from pontoon boat to stolen private jet to teeming urban warren to abandoned mine shaft, with the protagonists jerry-rigging sails, deploying DVDs as lethal weapons, slipping in and out of the People&apos;s Republic of China without visas, luring mountain lions into attacking their enemies and identifying the users of specific IP addresses (trust me, it&apos;s difficult), you just have to go with it. Many readers will do exactly that; despite its nearly 1,000-page length, this symphony of logistics is outrageously entertaining (especially if you&apos;ve always wanted to know how to convert the back half of a motorhome into a roving prison cell). Reamde doesn&apos;t boast the mind-blowing quantum metaphysics of Stephenson&apos;s last novel, Anathem, or the historical breadth and penetration of his gargantuan trilogy, The Baroque Cycle, but it doesn&apos;t aspire to, either. A liberal sprinkling of social satire gives the novel a bit of edge: T&apos;Rain is riven by a user-generated civil war between the Earthtone Coalition and the Forces of Brightness, which can be read as a gloss on Facebook v MySpace and the way that class friction in America manifests itself as quarrels over taste. One of the Russians shrewdly pegs a homestead of off-the-grid Idahoan evangelicals as &quot;the American Taliban&quot;. Walmart \u2013 particularly its well-stocked guns and ammo department \u2013 proves essential to the plans of both the jihadis and their opponents. (It&apos;s impossible to accomplish anything in America without at least one trip to Walmart.) Flourishes such as these reassure the reader that she&apos;s not merely zipping through an ultraclever espionage page-turner, but by the time everyone ends up shooting it out in the Idaho wilderness, Reamde has become just that. Scooping out most of the T&apos;Rain passages, amusing as they are, would leave the essential plot undisturbed. If the novel is meant to reflect the increasing entanglement of the virtual and the real, it doesn&apos;t succeed; at heart, only a couple of outrageous coincidences link the Reamde virus and T&apos;Rain to matters of life and death. Adding gangsters and terrorists and spies may once have seemed like a great way to spice up the subject of virtual, video game-based economies, but eventually the seasoning takes over the dish. On the other hand, Reamde is awfully exciting, and perhaps for the manically productive Stephenson, it amounts to a lark, a palate cleanser, the form R&apos;n&apos;R takes when cranking out dense historical sagas and elaborate alternate universe epics at the rate of 500 pages a year has become your daily grind.

American voters would be remiss if they don&apos;t look to the far east when thinking about whom they will support in the upcoming presidential campaign. That is why I&apos;m supporting Governor Jon Huntsman for president. For those concerned about the economy, China is one of the America&apos;s largest trading partners and also owns a large portion of its national debt. With every passing year, the Chinese use more and more of the world&apos;s limited supply of energy, which in turn drives prices up here at home. For those concerned about national security, China holds the key to disassembling the North Korean nuclear program and imposing further sanction on Iran for its attempts to build the bomb. It shares a border with Afghanistan, where US armed forces continue to fight. The Chinese also have one of five seats on the United Nations security council; so important for any multilateral action. For those concerned about the prospects of climate change, China is one of the largest and fastest growing emitters of carbon dioxide \u2013 among many other harmful chemicals \u2013 into the air. Any comprehensive solution to this problem here in America will also require full cooperation from their government and industry. And for those concerned about the basic issue of increasing global freedom and human rights, China is one of the worst offenders. China&apos;s massive state-run oil company is, in many ways, responsible for the horrifying human rights violations in Sudan and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 as well as the UN&apos;s sluggish response. The communist regime has more prisoners of conscience than any other nation. Despite the Chinese constitution&apos;s guarantee of religious freedom, Catholic bishops, people who start churches in their homes, and monks in Tibet are incarcerated with nothing more than show trials. Despite having a fundamental right to some due process before their property is expropriated, farmers are told to give up their homes or go to prison. Despite claims of a free press from the state-run media, journalists and bloggers who aren&apos;t afraid to write and publish stories unfavorable to the government end up &quot;re-educated&quot; by force. And despite basic rights to free speech and to petition the government, academics who use the &quot;D word&quot; \u2013 democracy \u2013 are maimed, tortured and sometimes even killed. I should know. I grew up in China, attended a top university there, and came to the US to pursue degrees at some of America&apos;s best universities. I witnessed \u2013 some say, survived \u2013 the massacre in Tiananmen Square. When I visited in 2002 to help the growing labor movement in northern China, I was arrested and sentenced to time in prison for &quot;spying&quot;. I served five years \u2013 and I owe my release to the outpouring of public support and the strong and tireless efforts of American officials who believed that the freedoms we take for granted here are both fundamental and universal. The next president will have to manage America&apos;s relationship with China through a period of global tumult. And the success \u2013 or failure \u2013 of this country relies on managing that relationship as effectively as possible. In the presidential field, there is only one candidate who has demonstrated the kind of leadership experience we need in the White House: Governor Jon Huntsman.  He has lived and worked in Asia several times; first as a missionary in Taiwan, as ambassador to Singapore, and most recently, as America&apos;s ambassador to China. He has sat across the negotiating table from Chinese counterparts: as a deputy trade representative, as an executive at Huntsman Chemical, and as a hard-charging governor determined to push job-creating trade deals for Utah. He has long been a student of Chinese language, society, culture and politics; speaking pitch-perfect Mandarin and Hokkien. All of these factors give him an expertise that is sorely lacking at the US government&apos;s highest levels. While others would start from scratch, Jon Huntsman already commands the respect of the Chinese authorities and the adoration of the Chinese people. Recently, I had the chance to join a call between Governor Huntsman and members of the Asian American community. He has a depth of knowledge and an understanding of the issues \u2013 both large and small \u2013 that I have never seen in any of the many politicians I have met. For the many Americans who see economic stagnation as untenable, the on-again, off-again negotiations with North Korea as unreliable at best, the problem of global emissions as unsustainable, and the lack of basic human rights in many parts of the world as unacceptable; there is a candidate for you. Jon Huntsman is a man who knows how to solve problems and knows how to engage China. The best indicator of a candidate&apos;s ability to get results is their record of results in the past. If there&apos;s anyone who has that record of accomplishment and can get results on these issues of great importance to US national security, it&apos;s Governor Jon Huntsman."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2011/oct/11/fashion-s-night-out-reaches-japan", "publicationDate": "2011-10-11T16:36:00Z", "tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style", "Anna Wintour"], "sentences": ["Appearing alongside host editor, Mitsuko Watanabe, editor of Japanese Vogue, and Wintour are: Franca Sozzani, editor of Italian Vogue; Alexandra Shulman, editor of British Vogue; Emmanuelle Alt, editor of French Vogue; Angelica Cheung, editor of Vogue China; Christiane Arp, editor of German Vogue; Yolanda Sacristan, editor of Spanish Vogue; Viktoria Davydova, editor of Vogue Russia; Kirstie Clements, editor of Australian Vogue; Eva Hughes, editor of Mexican and Latin American Vogue; Paula Mateus, editor of Portuguese Vogue; Myung Hee Lee, editor of Vogue Korea; Seda Domanic, editor of Vogue Turkey; Rosalie Huang, editor at Large of Vogue Taiwan: Anaita Adajania, acting editor of Indian Vogue, and Anna Harvey, Vice President and editorial director of Conde Nast New Markets, who will represent Vogue Brazil and Greek Vogue."], "title": "Fashion's Night Out reaches Japan", "article": "Details of Japan&apos;s Fashion&apos;s Night Out were announced today.

While we agree there is a crisis in some areas of language learning in England, and are all in favour of measures that address this crisis effectively, we cannot endorse Gove&apos;s comments that there is a &quot;slam-dunk case for extending foreign language teaching to children aged five&quot;. On many levels there are problems with this policy. First, the jury is still out on what is the best age to start learning languages at school; there is no consensus that earlier is better. Much of the research claiming success in early language-learning has been carried out in immersion contexts. This is a far cry from the one to two hours a week that a primary school might be able to dedicate to languages. Second, as our report for the British Council shows (Investigating Global Practices in Teaching English to Young Learners, available online from 18 October, huge challenges facing teachers of languages to young children, not least in terms of motivation, class size, appropriate materials and meeting individual needs. What is more, most primary schoolteachers are not trained to teach languages \u2013 nor are many language teachers trained to teach young children. Gove, however, believes that, by &quot;pull[ing] all the levers&quot;, these challenges can be addressed. The experiences of other countries suggest that vast resources should be in place before any levers are pulled. Gove is also reported as saying almost every other advanced country teaches children a foreign language from the age of five. As the starting age for compulsory state education in many countries is above five, this cannot be true. Furthermore, although it is sometimes difficult to establish the age at which a foreign language (usually English) is introduced, current information suggests it is generally at a later age. In Japan, for example, foreign languages are introduced at ages 10 to 11, in Taiwan at ages nine to 10, in Denmark at age nine and in Germany at age six. The unfortunate decline in the number of young people who are choosing to study a language may eventually affect Britain&apos;s ability to compete economically. However, Gove makes an educational case for learning languages rather than an economic one when he states that learning a foreign language broadens &quot;the empathy and imaginative sympathy and cultural outlook of children&quot;. We totally agree with this claim but suggest that many British children already enjoy this advantage. Children from heritage groups other than English often speak a language different from the one used in class. However, it is rare that the cultural outlook of these children is fully valued in an educational system that often views being bilingual as a problem. If Gove is so concerned with this aspect of language learning, why does he not celebrate the achievements of these children?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/oct/16/chelidonura-mandroroa-marine-gastropod-nature", "publicationDate": "2011-10-15T23:05:33Z", "tags": ["Zoology", "Animals", "Wildlife", "Science", "World news", "Environment"], "sentences": ["C mandroroa has been found off the coasts of Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Madagascar and Kenya, an impressively broad distribution for a newly recognised species."], "title": "New to Nature no 56: Chelidonura mandroroa", "article": "Opisthobranchs are marine gastropods with diverse eating habits including carnivory, herbivory, and detritivory.

Thus a challenge remains to precisely reconstruct the evolution of these and related groups, while at the same time exploring their species diversity. Dr Terrence Gosliner of the California Academy of Sciences and colleagues reviewed Indo-Pacific species of the opisthobranch family Aglajidae in 2008, recognising 23 species from the region and pointing to what were probably 16 additional undescribed species. Ten more have been described in the past three years including six new tropical species by Gosliner.

With nearly US$250bn invested worldwide last year in renewable energy, and more still needed, we&apos;re seeing a global race for capital, with a large number of jurisdictions around the world competing for green collar jobs, strategic positions in technology types and more generally, economic diversification. Over the last couple of years, divergent policy approaches have emerged in the rapidly growing renewable energy markets of the east \u2014 mainland China, Taiwan and South Korea \u2014 and the mature western markets, such as the US and Europe. Policy-setters in the east are very much focused on driving economic growth to seize advantage from this increasingly important sector \u2014 providing an energy policy framework designed to stimulate substantial levels of investment, together with a closely aligned economic and industrial policy geared towards generating jobs in manufacturing, and capturing intellectual property or cost reductions as a source of long-term competitive advantage. In the west, government policy has included this same strategic focus but with the realisation that manufacturing jobs might not be sustainable in the longer run. What we see now in some of the more mature renewable energy markets are policies focusing on security of energy supply and delivering de-carbonised energy at the lowest possible cost. This has implications for technology and capital flows. Much of the intellectual property driven technology developed in Europe or the US is likely to be transferred, over the longer term, to the developing markets for commercial deployment or industrial-scale manufacturing. At the same time, capital flows will become truly global, with donor organisations and multilaterals helping deploy funds from the developed to the developing world. From a European or US perspective, the issue for policy makers is how to stimulate investment in areas where value is protected for that local market. Intellectual property-based technology companies, energy efficiency, support services and data management services are probably going to be more of a focus for the western markets than the manufacturing of equipment such as solar panels or wind turbines, for example. Despite the recent growth in investment, capital scarcity remains the single biggest inhibitor to growth in renewable energy infrastructure investments. As a result of the recession, corporations and utility companies no longer have the deep balance sheets that they can bring to bear. And with the minimum capital requirements and liquidity ratios of Basel III coming into play, banks are also busily rebuilding their balance sheets. At the same time, government policy support in the US and Europe is likely to become less generous as the focus shifts from stimulus to austerity and debt reduction. With these traditional sources of capital for renewable energy infrastructure likely to remain constrained for the foreseeable future, the sector needs new investors and new conduits for their capital. While the gap between needed and available capital remains large, there are some encouraging signs that new sources and conduits will emerge. Given the very long-term and low-risk nature of renewable energy infrastructure investments, along with the benefit they receive from transparent long-term feed-in tariffs or other forms of government backing, the asset class appears well suited to attract annuity funds, such as defined benefit pension schemes and the like. In the UK, for example, there has been a lot of debate about the proposal to create a green investment bank with the role of consolidating and repackaging existing project finance debt. This would free up banks&apos; balance sheets, and if such an institution had the ability to issue bonds, it could enable pension funds, life and insurance funds and fixed income to invest in the sector. Spurred by government policy objectives, state-owned banks and multilateral financial institutions are becoming more active players in clean technology. Chinese state-owned banks have stepped up lending to renewable energy companies. Both the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are focused on stimulating clean energy markets and are actively lending to the sector. Outside the asset-financing realm, venture and growth capital has a significant role to play. Here, the rather patchy historic performance of listed renewable energy or clean technology company stock can undermine certainty of exit for such investors.

The Caf\u00e9 des 2 Moulins, the film&apos;s key location, was flooded with sightseers, and sold on. Someone put a banner over Rue Lepic reading &quot;Welcome to the quartier of Am\u00e9lie Poulain&quot;. Megaphones pumped out accordion music in the street, turning the area into some kind of Marcel Marceau wet dream. Am\u00e9lie has that kind of effect. Watching it for the second time on the eve of its 10th-anniversary re-release, I still find Audrey Tautou&apos;s boulevard busybody simpering to the point of psychosis. (As our own Peter Bradshaw said of her flat-rearranging antics: &quot;Does the director know that this is precisely what Charles Manson claimed to love doing?&quot;). But lots of people like that kind of thing. Am\u00e9lie had its fair share of raves when it came out, and eventually clawed up $173.9m worldwide, with a hefty $33m of that in the US (on an initially limited release, too). Opening there in November 2001, it might have benefited from a kind of post-9/11 need for syrupy escapism, but its success can&apos;t be dismissed as mere circumstance. It made happy faces at the box office in Germany, Italy, the UK, Australia, Taiwan and Argentina in particular, on top of its $44m French haul. It became the third highest grossing foreign-language film worldwide, behind Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Life Is Beautiful (though Spirited Away, Hero, The Passion of the Christ, Bienvenue Chez Les Ch&apos;tis and Ponyo have since pushed it further down the list). Resistance to the idea, like the girl, is futile: Am\u00e9lie was a significant film. It was one of the clearest signs of the expansion in non-English-language mainstream cinema in the noughties. If even the notoriously subtitle-phobic American market was increasingly paying out the jackpot to foreign-language films (Ang Lee&apos;s Crouching Tiger had done $128m there the year before), then they wouldn&apos;t go short of opportunities in the rest of the world \u2013 if they were accessibly plotted and glossily directed. They were no longer dependent on the once-a-decade hit (the last French-language hit on a similar scale had been La Cage aux Folles in 1979) in the US market, or the best foreign film Oscar connection, to make a name. The new breed of slick foreign film had the booming international box office scene to milk, and the range and frequency of non-Hollywood-originated mainstream hits that followed Am\u00e9lie was a revelation: Kung Fu Hustle, The Motorcycle Diaries, The Lives of Others, Oldboy, Downfall, District 9, Slumdog Millionaire, to name just a few. It was out of the arthouse, and into the multiplex. Am\u00e9lie&apos;s American jaunt confirmed this broadening appeal. But, in 2001, it lingered on a kind of threshold. While Jean-Pierre Jeunet&apos;s funky directorial style, as Andrew Pulver noted in his reappraisal, was forward-looking, Am\u00e9lie was at heart an old-school export picture \u2013 packaging up iconic French culture (the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, Renoir, bistros, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e) as dutifully as an open-top bus tour. It relied on the tried-and-tested pull of beautifully photographed exotica that made The Last Emperor and Cinema Paradiso crossover darlings in the 80s. Many of the global non-English-language brigade that followed Am\u00e9lie binned this tourist&apos;s take and opted for grittier routes into their cultures. City of God began with the chicken&apos;s-eye view of the favelas, and didn&apos;t get much more elevated than that. Directors from Danny Boyle to Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n chose to take the back-alley route through their milieus, shooting in the shaky, handheld idiom that seemed more appropriate for capturing the on-the-fly dynamism of globalisation. Something shifted during the decade, with export cinema getting down&apos;n&apos;dirty and closer to the local point of view. Not everyone adjusted quickly: even Miramax, while they were giving Am\u00e9lie the marketing spritz in 2001, pulled out of financing City of God up front because, says its director, &quot;they didn&apos;t believe in it&quot;. Am\u00e9lie didn&apos;t bother to adjust to the 21st century at all. It revelled in its Eurodisneyfication of Montmartre, as Lib\u00e9ration&apos;s Philippe Lan\u00e7on put it. At the start of a decade of strife and realpolitik, it was already a film out of time, for the dreamers only. There is a pivotal scene where Audrey Tautou realises there is a banal explanation for the man who appears repeatedly in the album of discarded photobooth headshots: he is a photobooth repairman. This peek-behind-the-curtain feels like a Wizard of Oz homage, but unlike Dorothy, it doesn&apos;t liberate Am\u00e9lie. She still needs someone else to shove her out of clotted fantasia, even when it threatens her happiness. She probably didn&apos;t even notice when the film was beaten to the foreign-language Oscar in 2002. And yet it&apos;s Am\u00e9lie, not the victor, Danis Tanovic&apos;s tough No Man&apos;s Land, that&apos;s back in 2011, when strife and realpolitik seem to be all we have. Those squirrely eyes are clamouring from cinema billboards once again. Perhaps nostalgia and dreams always win."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/19/apple-microsoft-iphone-steve-jobs", "publicationDate": "2011-10-19T00:32:37Z", "tags": ["Apple", "Computing", "Tablet computers", "Technology", "Tim Cook", "Steve Jobs", "iPhone", "Smartphones", "Samsung", "Business", "Apps", "Microsoft", "UK news", "World news"], "sentences": ["Apple gives hardware contract to companies in China and Taiwan."], "title": "How Apple eclipsed Microsoft", "article": "Apple is now bigger than Microsoft, its old rival. Not just in market capitalisation but also in quarterly revenue and profits. Its enormous, ruthlessly efficient and capitalises on its strengths - its brand and marketing, and uses them to promote top class hardware and software packaged as brilliantly designed and easy to use products. And now it is looking to China: &quot;I&apos;ve never seen a country with so many people rising into the middle class who aspire to own products that we make,&quot; Apple&apos;s chief executive Tim Cook said. He has his eyes on the fresh possibilities of the hundreds of millions of people there in a way that no other western company has: he doesn&apos;t just want to sell them phones, he wants to sell them iPads and Macs too. If China clicks\u2013 and the fact that some Chinese cities had fake Apple stores which were so good they were indistinguishable from the real thing \u2013 then Apple has space for years of growth. iPod: revolutionising digital music Apple began its comeback with the iPod, released on 23 October 2001. It wasn&apos;t the first digital music player but was easily the best in class (due to a clever choice of the hard drive \u2013 a first from Toshiba, for which Apple secured an exclusive contract) and the fact that it had previously developed a superfast connection system for video, called FireWire, which it adapted to transfer songs. The iPod&apos;s ease of use easily won over consumers. Apple revolutionised the music player and digital music download market. Then came the iPhone, where Apple wasn&apos;t first with a touchscreen, yet did it far better than previous efforts by companies such as Nokia and LG, which sniffed at Steve Jobs&apos;s presentation but have since sunk into loss. Apple hasn&apos;t been able to dominate the smartphone market, but it&apos;s noticeable that Google&apos;s Android mimics the iPhone system (but didn&apos;t before its launch: it used a keyboard-based system that looked more like a BlackBerry). Given that Android dominates the smartphone market, running on over 40% of handsets now being sold, compared to Apple&apos;s 18% or so, one could say that the &quot;Apple interface&quot; dominates. iPad: tablets of success Then of course there is the iPad. Apple spent nearly ten years, on and off, developing it; Steve Jobs thought that Bill Gates&apos;s announcement in 2001 of a Windows tablet was intriguing, but the design team led by Jonathan Ive couldn&apos;t make something with a touch screen that was a real pleasure to use. So it was shelved but the experience of touchscreens was then put to use to develop the iPhone. The iPad was the next step, and while Apple is again - just as with the iPod - not the first in the market, it has completely dominated it. It holds the Guinness world record for being the fastest-selling gadget ever. The iPad&apos;s market share is 75% and will retain its lead till 2014. &quot;I still believe that the tablet market will be bigger than the PC market,&quot; Cook said after the results. Apple has a tiny share of the PC market \u2013 it just edged past 5% this quarter compared to the 95% of Windows. Is Apple ever going to reverse that? No, never. Its share is growing minutely and has done so for over five years. Apple&apos;s increase, though small, has affected PC sales. Selling Apples  Apple&apos;s strength is the diversity of its range of products: phones, computers, tablets and it sells music, TV shows and films. It also sells huge numbers of mobile apps and simple hardware like mice and trackpads and keyboards. The company has colossal amounts of cash - about $70bn (\u00a344.5bn), of which about half is outside the US (and would be subject to heavy taxes if it were repatriated). So it uses that cash to buy favourable terms and equip factories for its suppliers; in return it gets special treatment. It&apos;s the same method it used with the iPod, but now done with hundreds of millions of dollars unlike what it could offer a decade ago. The iPod sales are falling year-on-year. Apple is mainly focussing now on its iPod Touch, in effect an iPhone without the phone. About 100 million have been sold. Many of these will be able to use the new iMessage service, which can send messages to other iPhone or iPad users over the internet. It&apos;s like an entry-level version of the iPhone (and a challenge to RIM&apos;s BlackBerry Messenger. The company needs its rivals The only thing Apple doesn&apos;t do is manufacture hardware. But Cook, who was hired by Jobs in 1997 has gradually changed that. Apple gives hardware contract to companies in China and Taiwan. Its most serious rival in hardware is Samsung, the South Korean conglomerate with whom it is fighting a series of court battles over patents on mobiles, smartphones and tablets. Samsung also has a new flagship Android phone, just released, but without the immediate UK availability of the iPhone 4S. And yet ironically, Apple is also Samsung&apos;s biggest customer. They need each other. The other key rival is Amazon, which sells more content than Apple, but also does hardware through its Kindle, and especially the low-cost Fire tablet. Where Apple profits on the hardware, Amazon profits on the content, siting them at opposite ends of the same market. Apple in the cloud And then there is iCloud. Both Google and Microsoft have been pushing to take cloud computing to the next level. But Apple&apos;s iCloud service already has 20 million users, making it one of the biggest players in the sector. However, unlike Microsoft and Google, its aim is to use it to sell hardware, rather than software or services. But for a really clear example of Apple&apos;s efficiency, consider a figure that&apos;s normally ignored: its inventory (the hardware that&apos;s sitting around in warehouses). At the end of the quarter, Apple, despite its colossal turnover, had just under three days&apos; worth of stock under its ownership. Far less than Nokia(35 days) or BlackBerry-maker RIM (45 days). Short inventories are generally a good sign in a hardware company: they indicate good supply chain management and product planning. Steve Jobs hired Tim Cook to tighten up Apple&apos;s then-sloppy inventory management. He has got it down from weeks to days. Ideally, he wants it to be hours. But Apple&apos;s growth has defeated that ambition. It&apos;s not a bad one to miss, though."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/oct/21/3", "publicationDate": "2011-10-21T15:30:00Z", "tags": ["Science", "Zoology", "Birds", "Wildlife", "Animals"], "sentences": ["  Mystery Bird photographed near Taichung, central Taiwan, China.", "This striking Taiwanese mystery bird is a popular avicultural subject in both the United States and Europe -- a good thing since this bird is listed as CITES Appendix I (endangered), although IUCN red-lists this species as being &quot;near threatened&quot;."], "title": "Today's mystery bird for you to identify | @GrrlScientist | Punctuated Equilibrium", "article": "  Mystery Bird photographed near Taichung, central Taiwan, China.

Can you tell me a little about this bird&apos;s colouration and what that may suggest about this species&apos; evolutionary origin? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species?  About the Daily Mystery Bird:  The Rules: 1. Keep in mind that people live in zillions of different time zones around the globe, and some people are following on their mobile phones. So let everyone play the game. Wait to identify the bird until 24 to 36 hours after it&apos;s been published.2. If you know the bird&apos;s identity, provide subtle hints to let others know that you know. Your hints may be helpful as small clues to less experienced players. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones.4. Comments that spoil others&apos; enjoyment may be deleted. The Game: 1. This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too).2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone&apos;s enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all.4. Each bird species will be demystified approximately 48 hours after publication.  You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page.  If you have bird images, video or mp3 files that you&apos;d like to share with a large and (mostly) appreciative international audience here at The Guardian, feel free to contact me to learn more.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  twitter: @GrrlScientist facebook: grrlscientistemail: grrlscientist@gmail.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/oct/22/football-myopics-blind-olympic-spirit", "publicationDate": "2011-10-22T21:55:03Z", "tags": ["Team GB Olympic football", "Olympics 2012: football", "Olympic Games 2012", "Team GB", "Football", "Arsenal", "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "sentences": ["More than half a century ago they beat Taiwan 3-2, drew 1-1 with Italy and lost 4-3 to Brazil."], "title": "Football's self-serving myopics are blind to the Olympic spirit | Paul Hayward", "article": "It was the &quot;basically&quot; that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will come to regret when the Games commence. &quot;For me, the Olympics is for track and field, basically,&quot; said the Arsenal manager, thus breaking the awful news to sailors, rowers and cyclists that they are mere extras at an athletics meet. This lapse into myopia by one of football&apos;s smartest thinkers will disappoint Gunners-supporting Olympians, who might have expected their leader to respect their efforts the way he asks them to support his work at London Colney and the Emirates. One morning next summer Wenger will wake in his north-London home to find the metropolis throbbing with some of the 26 sports and 39 disciplines that make up the Games. Not everyone will be sporting running spikes or carting a javelin. A fellow resident of his adopted city may point out to him that football joined the modern Olympics in 1908 \u2013 in London, mark you \u2013 and is not an impostor sport dropped on the carnival by lobbyists or sponsors. Frankly, football is leaving a terrible stink at the biggest sporting event in this country&apos;s history, about which many of us harbour political reservations without wishing to trash the whole fiesta. From the minute football killed off the idea that Wembley should be a national stadium and not just a palace for England and the cup competitions, the round-ball religion has done nothing but violate the Olympic vision. Top of the list of curmudgeons are the Scottish Football Association, who within minutes of Stuart Pearce and Hope Powell being appointed to the men&apos;s and women&apos;s teams rushed out another self-important statement warning of the dangers to their &quot;independent membership of Fifa&quot; and their &quot;representation on the International Football Association Board&quot;. If anyone seriously thinks Fifa would expel Scotland for not stopping Aston Villa&apos;s Barry Bannan from wearing a GB shirt in an Olympics in his own country, they are in serious need of\u00a0Valium. The Scots have concealed their loathing for the Team GB concept behind this constant fretting about their place at the international table. Worse, by leaning on Scottish players to not take part, they have displayed contempt for the ambitions of individuals who may just like to tell their grandchildren they played in the Olympics. It was painful to see Pearce having to tip-toe round the sensibilities of people who value their own role on committees more highly than the right of young players to pursue this one\u2011off\u00a0opportunity. We know where this comes from. To some in administration, the world&apos;s favourite game is so damned important that the brain itself becomes a ball, with valve and stitches. The sport becomes so closed off that people cannot conceive of the Olympics as a life\u2011enriching experience for the participants. Imagine Britain&apos;s players in the Olympic village, mixing with canoeists and rifle shooters. Maybe not such a good idea for Ashley Cole. This is a chance for British football to come down from its mansion and reclaim kinship with the wider world of sport. Not since 1960 have a GB team booted a ball around under the rings. More than half a century ago they beat Taiwan 3-2, drew 1-1 with Italy and lost 4-3 to Brazil. But they were gold medallists three times from 1900 to 1912. There is a history, a tradition. Seeing a GB women&apos;s team contest the medals for the first time will raise the nation&apos;s spirits in less complicated fashion. But the men&apos;s side will have to traverse a minefield to take on Brazil or Argentina, who view Olympic competition as an important developmental step. A British trait is to never stop to ask how we appear to the rest of the world. When the thousands of Olympic athletes look this way, they see a monumental legal battle to determine which football club will occupy a \u00a3547m Olympic Stadium built partly with public money. They see a breakdown in that process and a further \u00a3100m bill for the taxpayer so the arena can be shrunk and then rented to West Ham (probably). They see, in short, the all-conquering power of football, which they know anyway from their weekly diet of Premier League hype. Wenger&apos;s objections are consistent with his policy of resisting anything that might stop him beating Wigan 3-0 (and that includes international fixtures). Managers are entitled to defend their patch. But there is no justification for disparaging the Games as a track and field event with a load of nonsense wrapped around. Lots of us would like to see Gareth Bale and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in Olympic action. Jack Wilshere would like that honour, too. England&apos;s best young midfielder, remember, was driven into the &quot;red zone&quot; by overplaying, and missed the European Under-21 Championship as a consequence. An ankle injury has wiped him off the chart this season. You see where this is heading. Wenger is in no position to overexpose a 19-year-old in Premier and Champions League action and then tell him that to play in the Olympics would be a physical test too far. If British football wants to look down on the London Games, then fine, but it could at least not stand in their way."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/oct/23/7", "publicationDate": "2011-10-23T16:30:00Z", "tags": ["Science", "Zoology", "Birds", "Wildlife", "Animals"], "sentences": ["    Mikado pheasant, Syrmaticus mikado Ogilvie-Grant, 1906 (protonym, Calophasis mikado), also known as the Taiwan long-tailed pheasant, photographed near Taichung, central Taiwan, China.", "Question: This striking Taiwanese mystery bird is a popular avicultural subject in both the United States and Europe -- a good thing since this bird is listed as CITES Appendix I (endangered), although IUCN red-lists this species as being &quot;near threatened&quot;.", "DNA and other evidence suggests that the ancestors of the Mikado pheasant invaded the mountains of central Taiwan roughly 2.8 million years ago, when changing sea levels alternately transformed Taiwan from an island into a peninsula and back again.", "The Mikado pheasant has a very small range and is endemic to Taiwan, where it is revered as the national bird."], "title": "Mystery bird: Mikado pheasant, Syrmaticus mikado | @GrrlScientist | Punctuated Equilibrium", "article": "    Mikado pheasant, Syrmaticus mikado Ogilvie-Grant, 1906 (protonym, Calophasis mikado), also known as the Taiwan long-tailed pheasant, photographed near Taichung, central Taiwan, China.

Question: This striking Taiwanese mystery bird is a popular avicultural subject in both the United States and Europe -- a good thing since this bird is listed as CITES Appendix I (endangered), although IUCN red-lists this species as being &quot;near threatened&quot;. Can you tell me a little about this bird&apos;s colouration and what that may suggest about this species&apos; evolutionary origin? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species?  Response: This is an adult male Mikado pheasant, Syrmaticus mikado, a member of the pheasants and partridges family, Phasianidae. The pheasants and partridges are primarily terrestrial birds that are capable of sudden, explosive bursts of flights to escape predators. They are generally strongly dimorphic, with males having very showy plumage whilst the smaller and shyer females of the species are often clad in plainer colours.  The Mikado pheasant is one of five species that are placed into the genus Syrmaticus. These five species have dramatically different plumage colours but are united by having long tails, facial wattles and short spurs on their legs. Three of the five Syrmaticus species share plumage patterns, despite their different plumage colours. This species, as you can see, is black -- melanistic -- which suggests that it arose from a small founder population. DNA and other evidence suggests that the ancestors of the Mikado pheasant invaded the mountains of central Taiwan roughly 2.8 million years ago, when changing sea levels alternately transformed Taiwan from an island into a peninsula and back again. The Mikado pheasant has a very small range and is endemic to Taiwan, where it is revered as the national bird.  The global population is estimated to be between 10,000-19,999 individuals. The species is declining owing to hunting and habitat degradation. However, the species is protected in Yushan National Park, where half of the world&apos;s population resides.

One effect will be that the world output of magnetic hard drives could fall as much as 30% in the final three months of 2011 \u2013 and manufacturers who need them are now scrambling to snap up existing inventories, market research firm IHS iSuppli says. For Asia&apos;s PC makers, already grappling with the prospect of subdued year-end holiday season consumer demand, that could mean a further slowdown in the lunar new year sales season, and lead to weak sales in the first quarter of 2012, hurting the one regional growth area of an industry already facing a challenge from smartphones and tablets, and from slowing corporate spending on technology hardware. Alternatively, it might briefly push up prices on those which are available. &quot;From the Asia context, of course the impact will be on the Taiwanese PC manufacturers - companies like Acer and Asustek Computer,&quot; said Satish Lele, vice president, consulting, Asia Pacific at Frost &amp; Sullivan in Singapore. Thailand is the world&apos;s second largest maker of hard disk drives (HDD) after China, and makes about half of global output taking place there. The damage caused by flooding could keep factories closed or hobbled for months, analysts and executives reckon. Analysts have highlighted Japan&apos;s Nidec Corp, which controls about 80% of the world&apos;s output of a key HDD component - the motor - as the major potential bottleneck for supplies of drives, used to store data in computers. Nidec has closed some plants in Thailand, as has disk parts maker Minebea. The total demand for HDDs is presently around 660m units annually, with Western Digital and Seagate having just over 30% share. Hitachi makes about 16% of world supply, followed by Toshiba (11%) and Samsung (10%). Lele said PC makers will have four to six weeks on average of inventory, but will feel the effects after that is gone. &quot;From that context, the issue will start hitting these companies sometimes towards end of November and December, which for them are also key months because of the holiday season.&quot; Acer declined to comment and Lenovo Group, the Chinese company that is the world&apos;s No.2 PC maker in the third quarter, had no immediate comment. Pegatron, the Taiwanese company that is the main contract manufacturer for Asustek Computer , doesn&apos;t see a problem for six to eight weeks as makers have inventory, but after that it would depend on how fast things return to normal in Thailand. Pegatron Chief Financial Officer Charles Lin said there was one big difference between the Thailand situation and the aftermath of Japan&apos;s earthquake in March, which also disrupted supplies of components across a number of technology industries, including smartphones. &quot;The concentration of some component manufacturing [in Japan] was very high, but Thailand only makes up about a quarter of global hard disk production, so if plants elsewhere can ramp up, the effect this time may be less than that after the Japan quake,&quot; he said. Nick Wu, head of investor relations at Asustek, said the company&apos;s inventory and supply chain was enough to last until the end of the fourth quarter. But after that if the situation continued then there could be an impact. Asked about the effects on Apple, chief executive Tim Cook said in the company&apos;s recent earnings call that &quot;we source many components from Thailand, from many factories. The recovery timeline for these factories isn&apos;t known. The weather really hasn&apos;t allowed an assessment... It is something that I&apos;m concerned about.&quot; He added that &quot;our hearts go out to all the people in Thailand who have experienced these devastating losses of life and property as a result of the monsoons and the flooding.&quot; Apple sold its largest-ever number of PCs in the third quarter, but future sales could be affected by the slowdown in supplies. Western Digital and Seagate both have factories in Thailand. Western Digital&apos;s factories are closed, and Seagate warned it could face parts shortages even though its plants are running. &quot;With such a tight supply chain, it&apos;s very unlikely that people have a lot of stock to cover themselves,&quot; said Lillian Tay, analyst at Gartner in Singapore. &quot;But from what we see, the major impact will come in Q1 because it&apos;s a 50-50 (situation). Some of them may not get what they want in Q4 [2011], but I think Q1 [of 2012] is really going to be the quarter that the most impact will be felt.&quot; Nanya Technology, Taiwan&apos;s second-biggest DRAM memory chip maker, expects some impact from a shortage of hard disks. &quot;Because notebooks all need hard disks, there will be an impact on the whole IT industry in November, December and into January, and this is a negative factor for DRAMs,&quot; Nanya Vice President Pei Lin Pai told reporters when the firm reported earnings last week. Taiwan&apos;s Quanta Computer Inc , the world&apos;s top contract laptop PC maker, and the next biggest, Compal Electronics, said hard disks are &quot;confined components&quot;, meaning clients and not the contract makers procure them themselves. Both said they had not received any updates from clients. South Korea&apos;s Hynix Semiconductor Inc, the world&apos;s second largest computer memory chip maker, said the flood had not had a major impact on it, given the current inventory levels at HDD makers and PC vendors. Other products have already been affected by the flooding, with Sony delaying the launches of several new cameras, lens kits and headphones after production was halted. Frost &amp; Sullivan&apos;s Lele said PC makers will also take a hit as they will have to bear the costs of the shortage. &quot;It will be more for the PC makers to absorb the costs, because it is highly unlikely that they can pass it on to the customer. They will be under tremendous pressure to absorb the additional costs.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/26/nokia-launches-windows-phones-to-combat-apple-and-android", "publicationDate": "2011-10-26T16:47:57Z", "tags": ["Nokia", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Android", "Google", "Software", "Technology", "Technology sector", "Business"], "sentences": ["Hong Kong, India, Russia, Singapore and Taiwan will get the handset before the end of the year, with further markets early in 2012."], "title": "Nokia takes on Android with launch of Windows phones", "article": "Nokia is taking the smartphone battle to Android with the launch of a new handset in a collaboration with Microsoft that represents a last-ditch bid to shape computing&apos;s new frontier. With Apple and Google&apos;s Android now dominating the smartphone market, the world&apos;s largest phone maker is pinning its hopes of a business turnaround on the success of two models unveiled by chief executive Stephen Elop at the annual Nokia World event in London. The first Nokia handsets to run on Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone interface, the Lumia 800, priced \u20ac420 (\u00a3365), and the Lumia 710, at \u20ac270, are aimed squarely at the mid-market, which is dominated by the Android operating system. The phones were produced in a frantic eight-month period after Elop decided to abandon the &quot;burning platform&quot; of Nokia&apos;s own operating software in favour of Windows Phone. The Lumia phones run on its latest iteration, 7.5 Mango, which has had a limited distribution so far on handsets by HTC, LG and Samsung. In competition with Google&apos;s free Android software, Microsoft has struggled to get Windows Phone onto a wide range of handsets, with just 2% market share in mid-2011, according to analyst IDC. Microsoft will be hoping that Lumia, which Elop described provocatively as &quot;the first real Windows phone made by anyone&quot;, will deliver its software to a much wider audience. With sales of PCs declining in favour of mobile connected devices, Microsoft&apos;s influence over consumer technology will fade unless it can make its presence felt on smartphones and tablets. The US behemoth is understood to be lavishly bankrolling the Lumia launch, paying unspecified billions to Nokia as a thank-you for using its software, and the new advertising campaign will have a budget three times higher than for any previous Nokia range. The Lumia 800 will be released in November in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, with customers able to pre-order immediately from nokia.com, and 31 networks and independent retailers committed to marketing the product. Its case is a slimmer version of the colourful N9 released by Nokia earlier this year. Hong Kong, India, Russia, Singapore and Taiwan will get the handset before the end of the year, with further markets early in 2012. The United States is not on the list, because Nokia has no Lumia models yet that will work on 4G superfast mobile internet, which is already in use in across the Atlantic. The cheaper Lumia 710, which echoes the iPhone with its curved edges and white or black casing, will be available first in Russia and the far east, before heading west in 2012. Proclaiming a &quot;new dawn&quot; for Nokia, Elop said: &quot;Eight months ago, we shared our new strategy and today we are demonstrating clear progress of this strategy in action.&quot; He added: &quot;We&apos;re driving innovation throughout our entire portfolio.&quot; Elop is keeping one eye firmly on developing markets, unveiling four &quot;Asha&quot; handsets named after the Hindi word for hope, aimed at the &quot;next 1 billion&quot; users in those parts of the world where most people&apos;s first experience of the internet will be via a mobile phone. Having decided not to adopt Android as an operating system, Nokia has seemed frozen in the headlights of its progress. Since the beginning of 2010, the Finnish firm&apos;s market capitalisation has halved from $52bn to $25bn, and over the same period its share of the smartphone market has declined from 39% to 16%. Revenues have slumped, and operating profits of over \u20ac1bn for its phones division were as low as \u20ac132m in September. A former Nokia executive, Anssi Vanjoki, once said that by adopting Android, rivals like HTC were just like Finnish boys who &quot;pee in their pants&quot; in winter for temporary warmth. That decision allowed rivals HTC and Samsung to race ahead, but some experts believe that Windows Phone Mango is distinctive enough to have been worth waiting for. Its interface has been welcomed as an improvement on the design of Apple and Android. Benedict Evans at Enders Analysis said: &quot;Next year, Nokia and Apple will be the only people selling smartphones that aren&apos;t generic slabs of black plastic.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/27/shark-conservation-gaining-momentum", "publicationDate": "2011-10-27T12:18:51Z", "tags": ["Endangered species", "US news", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Fishing", "Food", "Marine life", "Environment", "Animals", "World news"], "sentences": ["Taiwan has said it will ban shark finning \u2013 the practice of slicing off fins at sea, then returning the animal to the water to drown.", "Tens of millions of sharks are killed each year for the shark fin trade, with Indonesia, India, Taiwan, Spain, Argentina, Pakistan and Mexico leading the way in 2010."], "title": "Shark conservation is gaining momentum - but are we doing enough?", "article": "     The shark that lands on the deck of the Coral Princess boat is 6.5ft of thrashing grey muscle and teeth, and the crew can&apos;t wait to get their hands on him. They slip a plastic breathing tube through rows of sharp, serrated teeth to pump water over its gills, and get to work: measuring, taking blood and tissue samples, and drilling a small hole in its dorsal fin to attach a satellite transmitter. The device looks a bit like a bath toy. Seven minutes later, the bull shark is back in the water. He&apos;s got a new name (Ben), a corporate sponsor, and a website that tracks his location every time his fin breaks the surface of the water. Neil Hammerschlag, who heads the RJ Dunlap marine conservation programme at the University of Miami, is beaming. &quot;He looked amazing,&quot; he says. It&apos;s not the typical human-shark encounter, but then the human relationship with sharks is at a tipping point \u2013 and just in time. Shark populations around the world are heading towards extinction. A creature once seen as a source of dread is now seen as a top priority for conservation. &quot;It&apos;s starting to feel like the tide for sharks is turning. There is some really good momentum,&quot; said Elizabeth Griffin Wilson, a marine scientist at conservation organisation Oceana. Even so, 2011 has been a particularly deadly year on both sides of the human-shark equation. This month alone, poachers killed 2,000 sharks at a marine sanctuary off Colombia. It may seem an implausible statistic but tens of millions of sharks are killed each year for their fins, which are used as a thickener in shark fin soup. On the human side, there have been 13 fatal shark attacks on humans this year, the latest victim being an American diver who was killed off the coast of Australia last weekend. So far, the spike in shark attacks has not affected the campaign to save sharks. This month alone, California and the city of Toronto banned the sale of shark fins. Maryland said it was considering its own ban. Taiwan has said it will ban shark finning \u2013 the practice of slicing off fins at sea, then returning the animal to the water to drown. Florida is expected to ban the catch of tiger and hammerhead sharks. There are moves to protect sharks in their own habitat: for example last July the Bahamas put 250,000 square miles of its waters off-limits to fishing. But the driving force has been an international campaign against shark finning. &quot;People have reached the point where it is so clear you have one obvious driver of shark mortality so people feel compelled to do something,&quot; said Julliet Eilperin, author of Demon Fish: Travels Through the Hidden World of Sharks. One study estimated that the demand for shark fin \u2013 seen as a delicacy in China \u2013 killed between 26 million and 75 million sharks a year. The global trade is estimated at $800m (\u00a3498m) a year. &quot;To be honest, sharks are being slaughtered out here,&quot; says Hammerschlag. Conservation groups say existing anti-finning measures still do not go far enough. US law still allows sharks to be killed for their fins \u2013 just so long as the carcass is brought back to land intact. It merely stops the practice of cutting the fins off at sea. &quot;The amount of shark catch hasn&apos;t decreased and populations are still declining. With the new rules, they are just bringing in the fins with the body,&quot; said Matt Rand, director of shark conservation at the Pew Environment Group. The protections are even flimsier in international waters. &quot;It&apos;s a free-for-all. You can catch as many as you want,&quot; says Rand. Hammerschlag argues that animals as in peril as some shark species need total protection. Shark populations have fallen by 85%, he says. &quot;A species in that kind of decline can&apos;t be harvested sustainably,&quot; he says. &quot;You can&apos;t have industrial fishing.&quot; And without healthy sharks, there can be no healthy oceans. As top predator, sharks are the master of the underwater universe. Take them out of the equation and the entire system falters, marine biologists say. Sharks were not built for procreation, at least compared with other fish. Tuna reach maturity at age two and produce millions of eggs every year. A shark reaches maturity only in its late teens, and will then produce only a handful of pups at intervals of a few years. And despite the Jaws lore, the majority of the 400 shark species pose no real threat to humans. Most are barely as long as an adult&apos;s arm. Hammerschlag and his team spend 80 days a year out on the water looking for sharks, cruising the Florida Keys with a cooler full of bloody chunks of barracuda. On this trip, he took a group from the Society of Environmental Journalists who pitched in on Ben&apos;s &quot;fitting&quot;. The scientists are trying to determine which sharks are most vulnerable \u2013 the finicky eaters, the ones most susceptible to stress \u2013 and, through the transmitters, to discover the mating grounds and other gathering points of the extremely migratory animal. The information they gather, they hope, will help frame conservation policy. They have tagged about 70 sharks to date, gradually building up a profile of their research subjects. Hammerhead sharks, it seems, will fight for their life. &quot;When it&apos;s on the hook, it&apos;s thrashing around,&quot; says Austin Gallagher, who is doing his PhD on shark responses to stress. &quot;The hammerhead is by far the most sensitive species of shark.&quot; Tiger sharks, though there numbers are also severely depleted, exhibit a different response. &quot;Tiger sharks are super chilled. They are super relaxed,&quot; says Gallagher. &quot;The tiger shark can be on the hook for three hours and be looking at you when you get it into the boat and it&apos;s like he&apos;s saying, &apos;Hi, how&apos;s it going?&apos; &quot; As a bull shark, Ben seems to fall into the second category \u2013 despite his species&apos; fearsome reputation. Bull sharks tend to swim closer to shore \u2013 and even upriver into fresh water \u2013 which brings them into more frequent contact with humans. Gallagher&apos;s blood readings show low levels of chemicals indicating stress. Ben, it seems, has not had a lot to worry about on deck. But it won&apos;t be the same now he is back in the water. Man versus sharks Three fatal shark attacks off the coast of western Australia since September have revived fears of great white sharks, which tend to favour shallow waters as they hunt for seala. There have been 13 fatal shark attacks worldwide this year, much higher than in previous years. But the chances of being attacked by a shark on a US beach are still about 1 in 11 million, according to the International Shark Attack File. The odds for sharks are much worse. Tens of millions of sharks are killed each year for the shark fin trade, with Indonesia, India, Taiwan, Spain, Argentina, Pakistan and Mexico leading the way in 2010. The US alone hauled in some 30,000 tonnes of shark catch last year. Half of the 400 known shark species are considered at threat of extinction. These include great white sharks, lemon sharks, tiger sharks, some hammerhead sharks and bull sharks like Ben."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/30/britain-talent-deficit-asia-education", "publicationDate": "2011-10-30T22:30:01Z", "tags": ["China", "Education", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Entrepreneurs", "Technology", "Finland", "US news", "Asia Pacific", "UK news", "World news"], "sentences": ["China-Shanghai by miles, with Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan clustered behind."], "title": "Britain's got a talent deficit | Peter Preston", "article": "What do you think of when China is beseeched to bail out the eurozone \u2013 and America, and pretty well any western country fallen on grotesquely indebted times?

Japan joins Finland in the top five, but China-Shanghai is far and away top, with the UK at 16th and America in 21st spot. So let&apos;s be clear. This is our future, our Anglo-American future, our European future \u2013 and we&apos;re blowing it. We trot out the old Blair mantra from memory. Education, education, education. We demand that entrepreneurs start new businesses to ease the crushing weight of unemployment. But when it comes to turning out entrepreneurs and technical wizards, the job creators of tomorrow, we are way off the pace. A facile parody of Chinese achievement sees workers toiling for 12 or 14 hours a day for pitiful reward. A more accurate version would see us being outgunned, year after year, in quality and in numbers. Tom Friedman of the New York Times broods over this in his latest book (That Used to Be Us, co-authored with Michael Mandelbaum) and finds naught for either Washington or Westminster comfort. Are the samples representative? Yes they are. Does Finland do so well because it&apos;s a small, homogenous nation that puts teacher standards and teacher pay high on its agenda? Yes again. So perhaps we can&apos;t expect the US or the UK, with its wide spread of immigrants, languages and backgrounds, to do anything close to as well \u2026 Except that Canada \u2013 huge, very mixed, multilingual Canada \u2013 is in Pisa&apos;s top 10 under all three categories. There are no excuses. Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Switzerland are consistently above OECD average. The powerhouses of Obama and Cameron are severely underpowered. Not everything is identical. American primary education is good enough; the problems set in at high school. British primary schooling, in contrast, turns out thousands upon thousands without elementary reading or numerical skills, kids condemned to failure at an obscenely early age. Part of our difficulty lies in bringing deprived inner-city schools up to snuff, of course; but the difficulty beyond that \u2013 the one that ought to be haunting us just as much \u2013 is that the schools we deem adequate, OK to middling, are falling far, far off the world pace as well. Don&apos;t forget the riots, the poverty traps, society&apos;s chronic instabilities, to be sure. But look outwards, towards competitor countries where high levels of education and application keep growth rolling along. Of course all the familiar principles of fairness and equal opportunity still matter. But if Singapore can turn out 10,000 brilliant computer programmers and we can only manage 1,000, then equality won&apos;t give us the critical mass of talent we need. OK isn&apos;t OK any longer. Revoltingly fat pay packets for OK business managers from Baltimore to Bradford aren&apos;t OK either. China isn&apos;t bailing out the euro or the dollar by chance this time round. It&apos;s putting so much more in to get so much more out of us in a jam."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/31/world-at-5-billion", "publicationDate": "2011-10-31T11:14:53Z", "tags": ["Population", "World news", "Environment"], "sentences": ["But it would be by no means impossible, as witness the startling declines on the part of certain communities in Taiwan, South Korea, Java, Thailand, Kerala State in India, Sri Lanka, Cuba, Mexico, Costa Rica and Colombia, during the recent past \u2013 these being countries that represent a broad range of political and economic systems, as well as of social and cultural backgrounds."], "title": "How we covered the world at 5 billion: 'We shall need to do an enormous lot of things right, and all at once'", "article": "Ronald Reagan was coming to the end of his second term in the White House, and though embroiled in the Iran-Contra affair, had just challenged the Russian president Mikhail Gorbchev to tear down the Berlin Wall. Margaret Thatcher had won a landslide victory at the polls and returned triumphant to Downing Street for a third term. It was the year the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke through 2,000 points for the first time (it is now over 11,000), while the UK music charts bopped along to the sounds of Whitney Houston, Duran Duran and Samantha Fox. 1987 was a different and less crowded world. On 11 July, the UN named Matej Mitja Ga\u0161par, born in Zagreb, Croatia, the 5 billionth human being alive on the planet. To make sense of the milestone, the Guardian invited the Norman Myers, the celebrated British environmentalist, to make sense of the moment in our global family&apos;s history. In the 24 years since his words below were published an extra 2 billion souls have been added to the planet. Myers speculated about returning the global average fertility rate to replacement levels \u2013 around two children per couple \u2013 by 2000 and keeping the planet&apos;s population peak to 8 billion \u2013 something he acknowledged would be a &quot;mammoth task&quot;. Nearly a quarter of a century hence it is clear we have failed to get close. Global population will add at least another 2 billion before dropping back. But the issues he raises for humanity to tackle - agricultural capacity, resource scarcity and the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; \u2013 have only become more pressing. As Myers puts it: &quot;We shall need to do an enormous lot of things right, and all at once.&quot; World without end? Amen \u2013 by Norman Myers, 4 Jul 1987 On 11 July, the United Nations has determined that the human population will reach 5 billion people. The UN won&apos;t designate the hour of that momentous day, nor the gender of the infant. But while the arrival of the baby in question will be a cause for celebration for the parents, it is a matter for commiseration for the rest of us. Every day there is more evidence that the planet is groaning under its efforts to support its present burden of humankind. The problem is not the intrinsic capacity of the Earth to support 5 billion. There are sound calculations to the effect that it could eventually support four times as many, perhaps many more still as we harness technology to make the deserts bloom, and all that. But this depends on our doing things right, and not just in expanding our agriculture. Twice as many people are expected to need three times as much fibre as well as food, and four times as much energy. In fact, we shall need to do an enormous lot of things right, and all at once. Yet we show a continuing capacity for doing things less than perfectly. The essential problem is that the Earth is taking on board additional people at a rate that far exceeds the capacity of societies to plan for them. Even the most advanced and well organised community would find it taxing in the extreme to accommodate more people at a rate of 2% per rear for decade after overloading decade. Britain never had to attempt it. When we were a developing country in the last century, we had to handle a population growth rate that rarely approached 1% and when things got a bit tight economically, we simply despatched the surplus to our dominions and colonies overseas. When the Americans had a growth rate of more than 1%, they could indulge the cry of &quot;Go west&quot;. Today the developing countries average growth rate of around 2.5% a year, and for the most part they have run out of wests to expand into. It is the exponential impact of population growth that causes trouble. Not everybody appreciates the in-built dynamics of &quot;demographic momentum&quot;: a growth rate of 3% sustained for 100 years produces an ultimate population that is 19 times greater than the initial size. Thus the main population explosion \u2013 or to give it its proper name, the population implosion \u2013 is still to come. It has taken 13 years for us to climb from four to 5 billion. The next one billion will take us only 12 years, and to reach 7 billion 10 more years. Only then will there be a slow-down, until we reach a projected final total of over 10 billion more than a century hence. Yet despite many efforts at birth control campaigns, the annual growth rate is still increasing a little. China&apos;s reproductive-age population is bulging as a result of the post-Great Leap Forward baby boom of the 1960s, plus a relaxation of its &quot;one couple, one child&quot; strategy. Well might the Chinese slacken off a little, even though the long-term consequences will be dire, according to the country&apos;s leaders. The one-child goal clashes with the desire of Chinese with the desire of Chinese parents to have a son \u2013 a preference they share with human communities in most places at most stages of history. Result: when the first born turns out to be female, it sometimes ends up in the local stream \u2013 a penalty of the delay by China&apos;s earlier leaders to get to grips with population growth soon enough and vigorously enough. This might give pause to Bangladesh, Pakistan, and other countries, many of them Muslim, which let parents decide to do as best they see it at the time. Some observers assert that rather than seeking to contain the number of people at the banquet of life, we should enlarge the table and place more food upon it. They might consider the prospect of Kenya, with 20 million people today. Kenya&apos;s population features a &quot;youthful profile&quot;, meaning there are many prospective parents coming up through the ranks. Even were Kenya to come down to a two-child family forthwith (instead of eight), it would still reach 53 million people before growth peters out. Yet even were it to institute high-tech agriculture of the sort practised by the Dutch and Japanese, Kenya could not support more than 51 million people off its limited land. The projected total for Kenya&apos;s zero-growth population is 111 million. The July 11 infant is likely to be born to developing world parents. But suppose it were to be an American baby? If it follows the prodigal habits of its parents, it would waste more energy in its lifetime than 20 Kenyans would carefully consume. If it were a British baby, its demand for peanut products and cotton would stimulate the growing of export crops in the Sahel, which tends to drive landless peasants into arid lands where they foster the spread of desert. Each time we (well, you) climb on to our weekend yacht, we might speculate that much of the high quality timber has come from tropical forests. The price paid for the timber does not reflect all costs that go into its production in those forests especially over-cutting and other environmental damages. Our fossil fuel binge is the main source of the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; that promises to disrupt climates for communities throughout the world. All too unwittingly but effectively and increasingly, developed world citizens contribute to the rundown of the planet&apos;s natural resources that sustain everyone&apos;s welfare. It is the super-rich 1 billion that do as much damage to our Only One Earth as the super-poor 1 billion. Yet there is good news too. There are splendid opportunities to reduce birth rates with massive advantages. If the global community were to achieve a replacement level of fertility \u2013 namely a two-children family on average \u2013 by the year 2005, or 21 years earlier than the United Nations assumes in its medium projection to be a realistic target, the ultimate global population would stabilise at around 8 billion persons, or more than 2 billion fewer than the projection. If replacement levels of fertility were not reached until 20 years later than anticipated, 2.8 billion people will be added to the projected global total. The difference of 4.8 billion is almost as many people as there are on Earth right now. To reduce the fertility rate to replacement level by the year 2000 would be a mammoth task. But it would be by no means impossible, as witness the startling declines on the part of certain communities in Taiwan, South Korea, Java, Thailand, Kerala State in India, Sri Lanka, Cuba, Mexico, Costa Rica and Colombia, during the recent past \u2013 these being countries that represent a broad range of political and economic systems, as well as of social and cultural backgrounds. If Nigeria, for instance, were to achieve that goal, its ultimate population size would not be 532 millions but 227 millions \u2013 with a host of expanded options for the nation&apos;s sustainable development. The Indian sub-continent&apos;s total, now projected to reach 2.4 billion, would be reduced to 1.8 billion. To reduce the fertility rate, most couples have to be provided with motivation as well as &quot;contraceptive hardware&quot; which is why the overall task is daunting. But we could make a solid dent in the problem by merely taking care of the needs of women who want fewer or no more children, but who lack family planning facilities. According to various surveys, the proportion of women with such unmet needs ranges in different countries from 11% to 29%. Suppose we accept a rough average, for the sake of a working approximation, of 20% of the 400 million women &quot;at risk&quot; in developing countries, or 80 million in all: even this relatively small number would be enough to reduce the ultimate population by many hundreds of millions. To supply contraceptive services to these women would add, at an average cost of $12 per head, only another $1bn or so on top of the present annual family planning expenditures (China excepted) of about $1 billion. That sum is equivalent to one third of one day&apos;s military spending worldwide. Which would buy us the more all-round security?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/31/half-uk-population-owns-smartphone", "publicationDate": "2011-10-31T14:30:42Z", "tags": ["Smartphones", "Apple", "Mobile phones", "Technology", "Google", "Android", "Software", "BlackBerry", "iPhone", "Telecoms", "BlackBerry corporation"], "sentences": ["Among Android handset makers, Taiwan&apos;s HTC took the lead in the UK, with 45% of the sales for Google&apos;s software in the past 12 weeks."], "title": "Half of UK population owns a smartphone", "article": "Just under half of the UK population now owns a smartphone, and Google&apos;s mobile operating system Android is powering half of those those being sold \u2013 followed by RIM&apos;s BlackBerry models with 22.5% and Apple&apos;s iPhone at 18.5%. The pace of smartphone sales is accelerating rapidly, too. In the 12 weeks to 2 October, they comprised just under 70% of mobile phones, according to new research from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. The findings mark a key shift in the availability of mobile phones and internet connectivity in the UK, as millions more people become connected through handheld devices with access to data services on the move. But for Finland&apos;s Nokia, the past three months have seen its smartphone sales drift even further downwards, so that its Symbian OS \u2013 which is being phased out \u2013 made up only 6% of sales, compared to nearly 20% a year ago. Apple also saw its share of sales fall dramatically, from 33% to 18.5%. However both have cause to look ahead to the next set of data. Nokia has just relaunched its smartphone offering, introducing phones which go on sale from mid-November using Microsoft&apos;s new Windows Phone software. For Apple, Kantar&apos;s data measurements ended two days before it launched its newest iPhone 4S handset, which has since seen record demand. Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in October that the company had seen a rapid slowdown in sales ahead of the launch as people waited for the new device. Carolina Milanesi, smartphones analyst at the research company Gartner, said though that many of the smartphones now in peoples&apos; hands are just being used as &quot;glorified feature phones&quot; \u2013 the previous generation of phones, which could not run apps or connect to the internet. &quot;People are still pretty much using them for calls and texts,&quot; she said. &quot;What&apos;s needed is for people to be educated more by the handset companies about what they can do with the device. &quot;Apple is good at showing people how they can use apps, but other companies need to move away from saying they&apos;ve got five-megapixel cameras or whatever. But I think next year we will see people using these devices more effectively as more apps become available on low-end devices, especially as those become more powerful.&quot; Android&apos;s share of the UK market has roughly doubled since the same period in 2010, when it had 29% of the market. Among Android handset makers, Taiwan&apos;s HTC took the lead in the UK, with 45% of the sales for Google&apos;s software in the past 12 weeks. But Samsung, which recently claimed the crown as the world&apos;s largest maker of smartphones, is catching up, reports Kantar, with 38% of Android sales, boosted by its Galaxy SII and Ace handsets. Sony Ericsson saw its share drop from 20.5% of Android sales a year ago to just 8.5% over the three months to October \u2013 which will give Sir Howard Stringer, who last week announced a full buyout of joint venture partner Ericsson, extra impetus to restore the phone company&apos;s fortunes. Nokia and Microsoft now see their future as co-dependent in the mobile space \u2013 and the challenge for Microsoft was emphasised by the latest figures, which show that a year after it launched its Windows Phone OS with a number of handset makers, it only had 1.4% of sales. A number of mobile carriers have ceased selling the previous generation of handsets, and Nokia now stands as the principal driver for Microsoft&apos;s efforts in mobile. Dominic Sunnebo, Kantar&apos;s global consumer insight director, warned that the next year could see a lot of jockeying for customers. &quot;&quot;Over the next six to 12 months, the current group of Android owners will be coming to the end of their contracts and looking for an upgrade,&quot; he said. &quot;Our data shows that when these consumers upgrade they tend to remain fairly loyal to Android itself \u2013 62% buy another Android mobile \u2013 but considerably less so to the handset manufacturer.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/oct/31/curse-halloween-baby-women-birth", "publicationDate": "2011-10-31T14:47:18Z", "tags": ["Reproduction", "Biology", "Science", "Halloween", "Childbirth", "Health & wellbeing", "Life and style", "Health", "Society", "UK news", "US news"], "sentences": ["A 2003 study carried out in Taiwan showed increases in Caesarean births on auspicious days and decreases on inauspicious days of the Chinese lunar calendar."], "title": "The curse of the Halloween baby: women avoid giving birth on 'evil day'", "article": "Pregnant women are capable of influencing the timing of their babies&apos; births, according to a study that shows fewer children are born on Halloween. The results of an analysis of almost 2.5 million births in the US over 11 years contradicts the current medical orthodoxy that expectant mothers have no control over the timing of the delivery of their babies. Dr Rebecca Levy of Yale School of Public Health, who led the study, said Halloween&apos;s associations with death, evil and skeletons might subconsciously put women off giving birth. &quot;The study raises the possibility that the assumption underlying the term &apos;spontaneous birth&apos;, namely, that births are outside the control of pregnant women, is erroneous,&quot; Dr Levy told New Scientist magazine. She added that a connection between the state of mind of pregnant women and hormone levels could explain the link. &quot;We know that hormones control birth timing, and mothers do often express a desire to give birth on a certain day,&quot; she says. &quot;But the process that allows those thoughts to potentially impact the timing, we don&apos;t know.&quot; Dr Levy and colleagues analysed data from birth certificates for all births in the US that took place within one week on either side of Valentine&apos;s Day and Halloween between 1996 and 2006. They found the likelihood of women giving birth on Valentine&apos;s Day was on average 5% higher than on other days during the week before or the week after. It was 3.6% higher for natural, non-induced births and 12.1% higher for Caesarean section births. The chance of deliveries occurring on Halloween was on average 11.3% lower than during the days in the week before and after. This broke down to 5.3% lower for natural, non-induced births, and 16.9% lower for Caesareans. The results are published in the journal Social Science &amp; Medicine. Dr Levy said more research was needed to characterise precisely how particular states of mind affected physiology to speed up or delay birth. There has been anecdotal evidence from partners of members of the military suggesting that when fathers are due to return from postings away from home close to the date of birth, their babies sometimes &quot;wait&quot; until their return before being born. A 2003 study carried out in Taiwan showed increases in Caesarean births on auspicious days and decreases on inauspicious days of the Chinese lunar calendar."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/nov/01/china-hacking-chemical-military-companies", "publicationDate": "2011-11-01T08:11:26Z", "tags": ["Hacking", "Cybercrime", "Data and computer security", "Technology"], "sentences": ["In February, McAfee said hackers operating from China stole information from oil companies in the US, Taiwan, Greece and Kazakhstan about operations, financing and bidding for oil fields."], "title": "China 'targeted 48 chemical and military companies in hacking attack'", "article": "Cyber-attacks traced to China targeted at least 48 chemical and military-related companies over the summer in an effort to steal technical secrets, an American computer security company has said, raising the temperature of complaints about pervasive internet crime emanating from the new superpower.. The targets included 29 chemical companies and 19 others which make advanced materials used by the military, said security firm Symantec in a report. It said the group included multiple Fortune 100 companies but did not identify them or say where they were located. &quot;The purpose of the attacks appears to be industrial espionage, collecting intellectual property for competitive advantage,&quot; said the report. The claim comes as a conference meets in London to discuss cybercrime and internet attacks, led by the defence secretary William Hague, and after the chief of the GCHQ listening agency warned that threats against government infrastructure from foreign hackers were at &quot;disturbing&quot; levels. Security experts say China is a centre for internet crime, whether government-sanctioned or not. Multiple attacks against governments, companies and human rights groups have been traced to this country, though finding the precise source is nearly impossible. China&apos;s military is a leader in cyberwarfare research but the government has rejected allegations of cyber-spying, and says it also is a target. The latest attacks occurred between late July and September and used emails sent to companies to plant software dubbed &quot;PoisonIvy&quot; in their computers, Symantec said. It said the same hackers also were involved in attacks earlier this year on human rights groups and auto companies. Symantec said it traced the attacks to a computer system owned by a Chinese man in his 20s in the central province of Hebei. It said that when contacted, the man provided a contact who would perform &quot;hacking for hire.&quot; The company said it could not determine whether the Chinese man was a lone attacker, whether he had a direct or indirect role or whether he hacked the targets for someone else. It called him &quot;Covert Grove&quot; based on a translation of his Chinese name. Security consultants say the high skill level of earlier attacks traced to China suggests its military or other government agencies might be stealing technology and trade secrets to help state companies. The chairman of the US House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, Mike Rogers, said last month that Chinese efforts to steal American technology over the internet had reached an &quot;intolerable level.&quot; He called on the US and other governments to pressure Beijing to stop. The claims by Symantec add to the drumbeat of intensifying use of the internet for industrial and military espionage between nations. China was suspected of being behind the &quot;Titan Rain&quot; attacks which in 2006 targeted the US military and UK parliament, and earlier this year of an attack on the International Monetary Fund, which apparently was hacked to uncover secrets about money flows.  Equally, western intelligence agencies are suspected of having created the &quot;Stuxnet&quot; computer worm to target nuclear centrifuges in Iran and delay that country&apos;s efforts to acquire a nuclear capability. In August another security firm, McAfee, said it had found a five-year-long hacking campaign that it called Operation Shady Rat against more than 70 governments, international institutions, corporations and thinktanks. In February, McAfee said hackers operating from China stole information from oil companies in the US, Taiwan, Greece and Kazakhstan about operations, financing and bidding for oil fields. Thousands of Chinese computer enthusiasts belong to hacker clubs, and experts say some are supported by the military to develop a pool of possible recruits. Experts say military-trained civilians also might work as contractors for companies that want to steal technology or business secrets from rivals. China has the world&apos;s biggest population of internet users, with more than 450 million people online, and the government promotes web use for business and education. But experts say security for many computers in China is so poor that they are vulnerable to being taken over and used to hide the source of attacks which might originate elsewhere. Last year, Google closed its China-based search engine after complaining of cyber-attacks from China against its Gmail email service in which Chinese dissidents were targeted. That case highlighted the difficulty of tracking hackers. Experts said that even if the Google attacks were traced to a computer in China, it would have to be examined in person to be sure it wasn&apos;t hijacked by an attacker abroad."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/nov/01/letters", "publicationDate": "2011-11-01T13:09:01Z", "tags": [], "sentences": ["The manufacture of electronic goods is largely outsourced; as China chokes on our industrial effluent, cancer rates and birth defects soar; in the Philippines, computer assemblers are going blind; working conditions in Apple factories in Taiwan and China are driving employees to suicide."], "title": "Guardian Weekly Letters, 4 November 2011", "article": "Occupying our attention Your account, Local action with a global message (21 October), registered outrage at corporate greed and social inequality in 900 cities.

It is impressive that protests against financial excess are flashdriven worldwide. However, in many countries the campaigners get tagged with criminality; in some cases they are photographed by the police. There is a significant disconnect between the legitimate protester and the corporate speculator-fraudster. The latter are also electronically hooked up, but in discreetly secure ways that protect the privacy of their link to the fiscal merry-go-round: see the Fat Cats in Steve Bell&apos;s No visible means of support cartoon. While the protests go on, the perpetrators of fraud carry on with tax evasion, opaque accountancy, shadow banking, insider trading, money laundering and the like. Take One: Modern capitalism has ruptured economic order, wrought social havoc and fuelled consumer excess; it is a failed experiment. The time has come to halt self-enrichment scamming. Speculators who have gone wrong must not expect such mistakes will again be corrected from the public purse. Governments of whatever persuasion must learn to control corrupt financial speculation, and establish stable and resilient economic systems. Take Two: We should never again tolerate rotten financial advice, fiscal alchemy or speculative theft. Financial advisers must be obliged to uphold socially worthy, economically stable and environmentally sustainable values. Take Three: Two recent studies of lifestyle quality, based on empirical research, are reassuring. Wilkinson and Pickett in The Spirit Level establish that misery features conspicuously in societies of notable unequalness, and Derek Bok&apos;s Politics of Happiness demonstrates that high-end wealth and personal contentment do not correlate. In support of the Occupy Wall Street cause, we have these authoritative assertions that evenly balanced societies are happier societies. Robert Riddell Helensville, New Zealand \u2022 For all of those Occupy-protester bashers who praise multibillionaire employers for creating many jobs, be clear that they do not create jobs out of the plain goodness of their hearts; they create jobs for their own monetary gain. Capitalism dictates that when an employer invests in (pays a wage to) an employee \u2013 a living, breathing and often vulnerable human being \u2013 the employer expects a return from that investment. And, obviously, most of these job creators probably would be willing to eliminate any investment (paid wages) if their labourers would only allow it and the employer could still attain the equivalent return on the hypothetical non-wages.

R M Fransson Lakewood, Colorado, US Sending mixed messages Thank you, David Roman, for nailing a radical incongruence (Reply, 21 October). On the one hand the Guardian Weekly robustly documents the eco-crisis. On the other, its financial reporters laud economic growth that is funding eco-crisis all the way to planetary suicide. How Jobs changed capitalism (14 October) is a classic example. Your reporter unequivocally celebrates Steve Jobs for his innovative brilliance in designing and marketing tools such as iPads. Isn&apos;t it truer to say that Jobs manipulated us into craving toys that didn&apos;t even exist five years ago, regardless of their dire consequences for the health of the biosphere? Jung said that what is not made conscious is encountered as destiny; we ignore the shadow aspects of Jobs&apos;s wizardry at our moral and global peril. The manufacture of electronic goods is largely outsourced; as China chokes on our industrial effluent, cancer rates and birth defects soar; in the Philippines, computer assemblers are going blind; working conditions in Apple factories in Taiwan and China are driving employees to suicide. In a brutal feedback loop, an essential e-component and rare mineral \u2013 coltan \u2013 fuels civil war in Congo, where the crippled victims of mass rape are forced to work as slaves in the coltan mines. E-goods are made of plastic, which is oil-based and therefore a lynchpin of oil wars. E-waste is lucratively traded by criminal gangs and dumped on the poor. A speaker on ABC radio recently described mobile phones as the asbestos and tobacco of the 21st\u00a0century. Did Jobs change capitalism, or did he just pervert it into an even more ecocidal artform? It seems that he was clever but not wise. He exemplified the self-serving tunnel-vision of anthropocene economics as it devastates its own biospheric capital. I too am compromised; I don&apos;t know how not to collude. I have an elderly second-hand laptop sparingly used for final drafts, and I outsource emailing and the web to the conviviality of internet cafes. It&apos;s not enough. How do you live with integrity in the 21st century? Liberation from the schizoid space we&apos;re all trapped in can only come from a radically re-imagined culture. Ecozoic economics would internalise all costs, ban all hazardous substances, make ecological accounting a keystone of human activity, and redefine wealth as rampant biodiversity and healthy air, water and soil. True sustainability is almost as impossible as evolving from stardust. Let us begin. Annie March  West Hobart, Tasmania, Australia Libya is for the Libyans It is depressing to see the west operating on such a low moral plane in achieving its objectives in north Africa and the Middle East. Even allowing for the Machiavellian expediency that has always characterised international affairs, the methods we are using seem dubious, to say the least (Murky drama of the last hours of Gaddafi, 28 October). First Osama bin Laden was killed in what looked very much like a summary execution. And now Colonel Gaddafi has met a similar fate. Where is due process \u2013 the rule of local and international law \u2013 in all this? What are we supposed to tell our schoolchildren about our adherence to civilised values? It&apos;s time we starting getting it right. Libya will be seeking western help to carve out a new destiny now that Gaddafi has gone. In rendering any such assistance we must be mindful that Gaddafi&apos;s Libya was in large measure a product of past western colonial influence in that part of the world. This time around we must resist the temptation to re-create Libya in our own image and instead help Libyans come up with a society that most of them want and that genuinely serves their interests. Terry Hewton Adelaide, South Australia \u2022 The UN human rights officials, as well as US officials, called for an investigation into the circumstances of Gaddafi&apos;s death.

Alan Williams-Key Madrid, Spain It&apos;s good for nobody Surely anyone with a shred of humanity could only see the prospect of thousands of members of either sex missing out on the greatest joy in life \u2013 having a partner to fall in love and share one&apos;s life with \u2013 as an unqualified tragedy (Nation of desperate bachelors, 16 September). Yet Therese Hesketh&apos;s response to the plight of men facing such a fate due to China&apos;s unnaturally skewed sex ratio is, &quot;the situation is good for women&quot;. The situation for any branch of humanity can only be &quot;good&quot; if the entire tree is able to thrive, and any notion that one group&apos;s misery is to another group&apos;s advantage is an offensive and dangerous delusion.

The move came as security companies warned the virus seemed to have been altered since its first version appeared. They added that Duqu uses a formerly valid digital certificate that appeared to have been generated by a Taiwanese company. The computer giant responded swiftly to reports from security experts who warned the Duqu virus had already infected machines in the UK, France, Iraq and Iran. According to security researchers, the virus was sent to targeted victims in the form of a Microsoft Word document attached to an email. Microsoft on Thursday urged Windows customers using Windows 7, Windows XP Service Pack 3 and Windows Vista Service Pack 2 to install its temporary security fix. The company said it had seen &quot;low customer impact&quot; but would continue to investigate the vulnerability. The security fix can be used on any Windows machine. &quot;Microsoft is investigating a vulnerability in a Microsoft Windows component, the Win32k TrueType font parsing engine,&quot; Microsoft said in a message on its website. &quot;An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. The attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. We are aware of targeted attacks that try to use the reported vulnerability; overall, we see low customer impact at this time. This vulnerability is related to the Duqu malware. &quot;Upon completion of this investigation, Microsoft will take the appropriate action to help protect our customers. This may include providing a security update through our monthly release process or providing an out-of-cycle security update, depending on customer needs.&quot; The new virus, called Duqu because it creates files with the prefix &quot;DQ&quot;, is said by researchers to be similar to the Stuxnet virus that targeted SCADA control systems in Iran&apos;s uranium enrichment plant last year. &quot;Duqu is essentially the precursor to a future Stuxnet-like attack,&quot; the security firm Symantec wrote on its official blog. &quot;The threat was written by the same authors (or those that have access to the Stuxnet source code) and appears to have been created since the last Stuxnet file was recovered. The attackers are looking for information such as design documents that could help them mount a future attack on an industrial control facility.&quot; The first version of the virus connected with a server in India, but a more recent version tried to log on to a server in Belgium which has now been taken offline. Duqu consists of a driver file, a dynamic linked library (DLL) containing many embedded files, and a configuration file. Those are then installed by an installer built into the code. Duqu uses a valid digital certificate from a company based in Taiwan&apos;s capital Taipei whose private &quot;keys&quot; for generating the certificate were stolen earlier this year. It revoked the certificate on 14 October. The certificate allowed Duqu to bypass security checks on unknown drivers which Windows would apply.

He&apos;s explored it in the plays The Shape Of Things and Fat Pig, and now it surfaces again in the third of the trilogy, Reasons To Be Pretty, which is staged at the Almeida, the venue which introduced LaBute&apos;s work to British audiences. As usual, men are to blame for the physical fixation, and here the fallout begins when one man is heard by his girlfriend to admit that she&apos;s no great shakes in the beauty stakes. Meanwhile, his best friend has a gorgeous wife but still can&apos;t stop chasing after other women. LaBute directs his own work and a cast with Kieran Bew, Si\u00e2n Brooke, Tom Burke and Billie Piper.

There&apos;s a different approach in Stratford, looking at the men who translated the Bible, and the effect it had on them, as David Edgar&apos;s new play finds that it sometimes cost them old ideals and in some instances even their lives. Looking at the story of the King James&apos;s translator Lancelot Andrewes, who was prepared to betray his own younger self for the sake of peace in his time, this play brings the Reformation alive, one of the most momentous events in British history. Director Gregory Doran has assembled a terrific cast including Oliver Ford Davies, Stephen Boxer, Jamie Ballard and Jodie McNee .

For the second year, three of its alumni each direct a show as part of a 12-week season at the Trafalgar Studios, which starts with a new play by Tim Price. Hamish Pirie takes the director&apos;s seat for Salt, Root And Roe, in which elderly twin sisters \u2013 played by Anna Calder-Marshall and Anna Carteret \u2013 come to a decision that brings a daughter (Imogen Stubbs) rushing back to her childhood home.

Starting as a project in doctors&apos; waiting rooms, Donna Rutherford&apos;s Kin is now a full-scale theatre piece in which six middle-aged performers talk honestly about their relationships with their parents, intercut with video clips of the two generations spending time together.

The New7Wonders of Nature poll, its organisers claim, has attracted millions of voters choosing the final seven from a shortlist of 28 natural landscapes which include the Great Barrier Reef, the Amazonian rainforest and the Maldives. Launched in 2007, the project, is the brainchild of Bernard Weber, a Canadian-Swiss marketing expert. From 220 countries 440 images of natural wonders were submitted; these were shortlisted by a panel led by Prof Federico Zaragoza, the former head of Unesco. But after initially paying a registration fee of $199 (\u00a3125) to enter, each country was then asked to take part in a high-profile global marketing campaign that included a world tour. In May, the Maldives government moved to withdraw from the competition after receiving a &quot;surprise&quot; demand for half a million dollars. They were followed in August by the Indonesian government, representing Komodo Island national park, who said the organisers wanted $10m dollars in licensing fees and $47m dollars to host the closing ceremony. Todung Mulya Lubis, a lawyer representing the Indonesian tourism ministry, said it was still considering legal action against the foundation. &quot;We want to give them a lesson that as a foundation that attracts worldwide attention, they need to be fair with participants of the competition.&quot; However, despite refusing to pay, both countries remained in the competition at the behest of the organisers. Gordon Oliver, a former mayor of Cape Town, whose Table Mountain is on the shortlist, told the Cape Times: &quot;What authority does this organisation have to determine a natural wonder as a finalist? It&apos;s important that our authorities get the credentials of such organisations who set themselves up as the authority to decide the prominence of natural features.&quot; The New7Wonders Foundation denied it charged exorbitant fees to use its optional branding. Its spokesman, Eamonn Fitzgerald, said the allegations were baseless, and quoted an article he wrote in Minivan News, a Maldives newspaper. He also said: &quot;We hope that we can generate a surplus after this campaign, but all the money from votes goes into running the campaign and maintaining a voting platform for a global competition. We do not disclose how many votes have been cast. In our last campaign there were 100m votes and the target for this campaign is one billion votes.&quot; Fitzgerald said there were varying fees for using the foundation&apos;s branding, but he would not disclose figures. &quot;The figures vary by country. As a rule we do not comment on business and commercial aspects, which is standard practice in the business world.&quot; The environmental campaigner Tony Juniper said the idea was good in theory but charging fees was a bad idea: &quot;The idea of a global participatory process to engage millions of people in thinking through a list of top seven natural wonders of the world, strikes me as a good idea. Charging countries fees to promote marketing is not, especially when they are developing countries and this was not part of the original offer put to them.&quot; &quot;If the organisers were serious about the potential value of such an exercise for raising awareness and inspiring people, I think they should have secured funding upfront, not stage what to some has evidently seemed like a financial ambush.&quot; The winners will be announced at 11.11am on Friday, the 11th day of the 11th month in 2011. the Top 10 candidates not subbed and for print only - will appear in gallery form online Nicholas Milton Great Barrier Reef The Aussies are justifiably proud of the largest coral reef on earth. It can be seen from space and is supposedly the world&apos;s biggest single structure made from living organisms. Composed of some 3,000 individual reefs and 900 islands it stretches for 2,600 km and is strung out over 344,400 square kilometres of the Coral Sea in Queensland, north east Australia. Already a World Heritage site, it generates one billion dollars a year in tourism revenue. A definite in the top seven. Amazon Superlatives overflow when it comes to the Amazon Rainforest. Despite being cut down at an alarming rate, it still covers seven million square kilometres. Growing across nine different countries, it represents over half of the planet&apos;s remaining rainforests making it the largest and most biodiverse tropical rainforest in the world. The forest is fed by the Amazon River, the largest river in the world by volume which also has the biggest drainage basin on the planet. Like the Great Barrier Reef a must in the top seven. Table Mountain The only natural site on the planet to have a constellation of stars named after - Mensa, meaning &quot;the table.&quot; \u2013 Table Mountain is a South African icon. The flat-topped mountain has withstood six million years of erosion and hosts the richest, yet smallest floral kingdom on earth with over 1,470 plant species. It is the most recognized site in Cape Town and is known as the gateway to Africa, owing to its unique flat-topped peaks which reach 1,086 m above sea level. A definite top ten. Galapagos Islands Famed as being the inspiration for Darwin&apos;s theory of evolution by natural selection, the Galapagos Islands are an archipelago of volcanic islands distributed around the equator, 965 kilometres west of Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean. They are famed for their vast number of endemic species and are already a World Heritage Site. Tourism is today strictly controlled on the islands having risen from just over 41,000 in 1991 to over 180,000 today. A favourite haunt of the BBCs Andrew Marr when not hosting his AM programme, Darwin would turn in his grave if the islands didn&apos;t make the top seven. Grand Canyon The playground of Theodore &quot;Teddy&quot; Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States, who liked to hunt there, the Grand Canyon was created by the Colorado River over a period of 6 million years. It is 446 km long, ranges in width from 6 to 29 km and attains a depth of more than 1.6 km. During prehistory, the area was inhabited by Native Americans who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves. A top ten contender if for no other reason than if the United States does have a contender, then many Americans will ignore the competition. . Mount Vesuvius With a temperament like Italy&apos;s soon to be former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Mount Vesuvius is a volcano east of Naples. It is the only volcano on the European mainland to have erupted within the last hundred years but is best known for its eruption in AD 79 that led to the destruction of the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. It has erupted many times since and is today regarded as one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world. Likely to be the only European wonder in the top seven. Sundarbans The largest mangrove forest in the world, the Sundarbans meaning &quot;beautiful forest&quot; has never got the recognition it deserves. A delta at the mouth of the river Ganges, the Sundarbans spread across parts of Bangladesh and West Bengal, India. They feature a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests. The area supports a wide range of fauna, the most famous of which is the Royal Bengal tiger. Should be in the top ten if for no other reason than to put in on the map. Dead Sea The lowest point on the surface of the Earth, tourists come from around the world to float in the Dead Sea, a lake lying between the countries of Israel and Jordan. At 418 m (1,371 ft) below sea level, it is almost nine times as salty as the ocean which makes it impossible for most life to exist in it. However, it is not completely dead, as some types of bacteria are able to live in the water. A dead cert for the top seven. Maldives The Maldives deserve to be in the top seven because they are among some of the most beautiful but low lying islands in the world. With the sea level rise associated with climate change, they could well not be here in a couple of generation&apos;s time. The Maldives are composed of 1,192 small islands with stunning coral reefs strung out like pearls across the Indian Ocean, 700 kilometers south-west of Sri Lanka. Two hundred of the islands are inhabited and over 90% of the islands GDP is reliant on tourism. Yushan Yushan meaning &quot;Jade Mountain&quot; is a central mountain range in Chinese Taipei or Taiwan. It is also the name of the highest point of the range at 3,952 m above sea level and is part of Yushan National Park, known for its diverse wildlife and ecology. The environment around Yushan spans from sub-tropical forests at its base to alpine conditions at its peak. Despite the enmity between Taiwan and the Peoples Republic of China, the Chinese have been encouraging their residents to vote for it so expect people power to easily place it in the top seven. A list of the new seven wonders of nature will be officially announced todayon Friday following a global online and phone poll. The competition from a short list of 28 natural wonders of the world is expected to attract votes from millions of people around the world. The poll, organised by the New7Wonders Foundation and its corporate arm, the New Open World Corporation, was launched in 2007 following a similar exercise to find the new seven wonders of the world which the organisers claimed was voted on by over 100 million people. The poll is the brainchild of Bernard Weber, a Canadian-Swiss marketing expert and businessman, who wants to create &quot;seven symbols of heritage and nature, to become part of the Global Memory forever&quot;. Over 440 natural wonders were submitted from 220 countries in 2007 which was whittled down to 28 finalists in 2009 by a panel of experts led by Professor Federico Zaragoza, the former head of the xUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. To ensure that the poll is fairer to smaller nations only 10% of the votes from the host country will be counted, the other 90% will be global. The vote has been organised to close at exactly 11 minutes past 11 am on the eleventh day of November 2011Greewich Mean Time to maximise the vote and the organisers hope, publicity. The New7Wonders Foundation claims the accolade offers major global promotional and marketing opportunities for the winners. However, the competition has been highly controversial because of the hidden marketing costs which each of the finalists has been asked to pay. After initially paying a registration fee of just 199 dollars to enter, each country was then asked to take part in a high profile global marketing campaign included a world tour. As a result in May the Maldives government withdrew from the competition after receiving a &apos;surprise&apos; demand for half a million dollars. They were followed in August by the Indonesian government, representing Komodo Island National Park, who said the organisers wanted 10 million dollars in licensing fees and 47 million dollars to host the closing ceremony.

As the wedding parties scoop pieces of the slippery, glutinous flesh from bowls of broth, they will not just be respecting tradition; they will also be defying a growing campaign to ban the trade in shark fin that has now spread to its most lucrative market, Hong Kong. It is easy to see during a short walk through Sheung Wan, a Hong Kong neighbourhood specialising in dried seafood, why the campaign to ban the trade worldwide has set its sights on the city. Shark fins fill shop windows, ready to be hydrated and boiled before being added to a rich broth, a gastronomic preserve of wealthy Chinese since the Song Dynasty in the 10th century. Rising prosperity since the 1970s has made the delicacy affordable to the middle classes, first in Hong Kong and now on the mainland. Eating it is so closely associated with new wealth that to say someone is &quot;eating shark fin with rice&quot; is to refer to their prosperity. Hong Kong handles as much as 80% of the global trade in shark fins, bringing in catches from more than 100 countries, with Spain by far its biggest supplier. In 2006 it took delivery of more than 10,000 tonnes worth $276m (\u00a3173m), according to the UN food and agricultural organisation. Most is consumed in Hong Kong and Taiwan, but also in mainland provinces such as Guangdong. Campaigners say it is next to impossible to verify the fins&apos; provenance, as they are dried and bleached, and often treated with ammonia, before reaching Hong Kong. &quot;The catches are not tracked at all, and there is no species monitoring or labelling,&quot; says Stanley Shea, a campaigner with the marine environment group Bloom Association, which last year conducted the most comprehensive survey to date of shark fin consumption in Hong Kong. &quot;We don&apos;t even know how much of it is eaten here or ends up in mainland China.&quot; Many shark populations have plummeted by 90% in recent decades, according to campaigners, who warn that if over-fishing continues at the current rate, the most commonly targeted species will be extinct in a few years. DNA analysis showed that 40% of shark fin auctioned in Hong Kong comes from 14 species, all of which appear on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature&apos;s &quot;red list&quot; of endangered species. After years of fierce opposition from traders and retailers, campaigners in Hong Kong say the local population is finally waking up to the ecological catastrophe. Several hotels offer discounts, cheaper room rates and other incentives for couples that choose not to serve shark fin at their wedding celebrations. One online campaign calls on wedding guests to reduce cash gifts by about a third for couples who select the dish. Last year campaigners persuaded Citibank Hong Kong to withdraw a promotion offering new credit card holders discount on a shark fin dinner. On the mainland Yao Ming, the Chinese NBA star, has appeared in a well-received campaign to end finning, the practice of removing a shark&apos;s highly valued fins and dumping what is left into the sea. But there are pockets of resistance, particularly among older people, who still regard eating shark fin as a means of expressing their Chinese identity. &quot;At weddings you have different people sitting around the same table,&quot; says Shea. &quot;Young people understand the problem and want to do something about it, but at some point their parents stop them.&quot; The manager of one Sheung Wan wholesaler, who asked not to be named, said traders were beginning to feel the impact of the environmental campaign. &quot;Sales are dropping and I think that is down to the campaign,&quot; he said. The manager&apos;s firm sells between three and four tonnes of shark fin a month. &quot;The wholesale price has dropped by about 20% over the past two months, although there are always fluctuations so it&apos;s too early to tell if this is a lasting trend.&quot; Charlie Lim, a shark fin trader, is receptive to the message on sustainable fishing but accuses some campaigners of hypocrisy. &quot;The Chinese tradition of eating shark fin will be maintained, but will increasingly come from sustainable fisheries,&quot; says Lim, a prominent member of Hong Kong&apos;s marine products association. &quot;Chinese people and traditions do make an easy and readily identifiable target for largely western campaigners. &quot;But many western campaigners who are seriously interested in promoting the sustainable use of sharks should look more closely at their home fisheries and the &apos;boneless&apos; fish products that their children may be eating from the supermarket.&quot; Despite its early successes, the campaign has yet to challenge shark fin&apos;s place at the heart of Cantonese cuisine. Bloom&apos;s 2010 survey revealed that 89% of the territory&apos;s 7 million people had eaten the dish at least once in the past year, with more than half saying they did so to observe tradition. Another poll found that only 5% of couples had opted for shark-free wedding banquets. But 66% said they were uncomfortable with the idea of eating an endangered species, and more than three-quarters said they would not mind if it was removed from banquet menus. Shea believes Hong Kong will be viewed as a pariah as long as it fails to introduce measures to protect shark populations similar to those introduced elsewhere. &quot;Hong Kong has always been a role model for the rest of China, and this issue should be no different,&quot; he says. &quot;Our message is that eating shark fin is unsustainable. At some point, the market is going to crash.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/10/sanjoy-roy-review", "publicationDate": "2011-11-10T18:15:00Z", "tags": ["Cloud Gate Dance Theatre", "Dance", "Stage", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Lin Hwai-Min&apos;s White, for his company Cloud Gate Dance Theatre of Taiwan, is a work in three parts made at two different times: the first section in 1998, the rest in 2006."], "title": "Cloud Gate Dance Theatre \u2013 review", "article": "Lin Hwai-Min&apos;s White, for his company Cloud Gate Dance Theatre of Taiwan, is a work in three parts made at two different times: the first section in 1998, the rest in 2006.

Three women flex and stretch like carved goddesses brought to life, moving restlessly among white banners that unfurl from the ceiling to form backdrops, screens or blockades.

The scene&apos;s mythic quality is rendered uncanny, even creepy, by the microtone dissonances and irregular rumbles of Stephen Scott&apos;s\u00a0electronic score. White II returns to the here and now: the stage&apos;s own mechanics dominate this episode, during which low-hanging lighting rigs are raised, a black floorcloth lifted to form a lowering ceiling, and the dancers pull up cables to allow strips of flooring to be dragged off. The eight white-clad dancers wheel and swerve among the shifting scenery like ghostly moths.

This fact above all others as been widely reported in the press, perhaps with the expectation that the nation, like a 19th-century dame, would collectively primp its petticoats at the\u00a0sight of &quot;a coloured gentleman&quot;. Arnold&apos;s decision to augment Emily Bront\u00eb&apos;s text with lines such as, &quot;He&apos;s not my brother, he&apos;s a nigger!&quot; only exacerbates the racial provocation. But the new Wuthering Heights has also drawn attention to the fact that up to now, Heathcliff has been played exclusively by Caucasian actors \u2013 Laurence Olivier, Ralph Fiennes, Tom Hardy, Timothy Dalton, the only notable exception being Anglo-Indian Cliff Richard with his disastrous stage musical, Heathcliff (an exclamation mark on the end might have swung it). In her novel, Bront\u00eb leaves Heathcliff&apos;s precise ethnicity open to debate, variously describing him as &quot;a Lascar&quot; and a &quot;dark-skinned gipsy in aspect&quot;, which only adds to the confusion. Should he be black? White? Roma? Indian? Couldn&apos;t they have just cast Colin Firth? The relationship between the ethnicity of a movie character and that of the actor playing them has never been a straightforward matter, but right now it seems to be particularly complicated, if not downright contradictory. For some, it is a sign that we are moving towards a &quot;colour-blind&quot; entertainment environment of equal opportunities; for others it is a threat to racial boundaries and identities. Now, at least, we have a\u00a0name for it: &quot;race-lifting&quot;. The term was apparently coined by a\u00a0rather brilliant wiki called TV Tropes \u2013 an online compendium of fiction-writing cliches \u2013 and is defined as the changing of a fictional character&apos;s race for a derivative work. Race-lifting can take many forms. TV Tropes lists eight variations, the earliest and most notorious of which would be &quot;blackface&quot;: passing off white actors in dark makeup as African-descended characters. Al Jolson in The\u00a0Jazz Singer is the most notorious example, but the practice went on far longer than we would like to think. Laurence Olivier blacked up for his film of Othello in 1965, and The Black and White Minstrel Show stayed on British television until 1978. It did not stop with African characters either: Breakfast At Tiffany&apos;s is permanently scarred by Mickey Rooney&apos;s excruciating &quot;Japanese&quot; Mr Yunioshi, just as Alec Guinness&apos;s &quot;Indian&quot; in A\u00a0Passage To India now looks like an embarrassing anomaly. And let&apos;s not get into John Wayne&apos;s Genghis Khan. The movie industry has supposedly cleaned up this particularly shameful act, but it has been replaced by a subtler form of race-lifting: rather than hiring actors of the same ethnicity to play non-Caucasian characters, Hollywood often simply changes the ethnicity of the characters themselves. Instead of hiring a black actor to play Othello, you\u00a0just make Othello white. This new, insidious form of race-lifting has been particularly applied to &quot;based on a true story&quot; movies, which, being true stories, often feature an inconvenient proportion of roles not suitable for white actors. Recent examples would include last year&apos;s Extraordinary Measures, based on the true story of a couple who enlisted a doctor to find a cure for their children&apos;s rare genetic disease. In the movie, that heroic doctor is Robert Stonehill, played by Harrison Ford (think Han Solo in a labcoat); in real life, he&apos;s Chen Yuan-tsong, from Taiwan. Or there was the 2008 teen thriller 21, based on the true story of MIT students who used their maths expertise to beat the Las Vegas blackjack tables. Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth led the movie&apos;s predominantly white posse of brainiacs, but in real life the students consisted of five Asian-Americans and one white woman. Or there was A Beautiful Mind in which Russell Crowe portrayed mathematician John Nash. Jennifer Connelly won an Oscar playing Nash&apos;s wife, Alicia, despite the fact the real Alicia was from\u00a0El Salvador. The list goes on. It was only when the movies started messing with works of pure fiction, however, that the public really got upset. The highest-profile case was in\u00a02010&apos;s fantasy action flop The Last Airbender, directed by M Night Shyamalan. It was based on a popular TV cartoon series blending Asian, Inuit\u00a0and Native American philosophy, history and martial arts and predominantly featuring dark-skinned characters. When it came to the film version, however, the four principal characters were all cast as light-skinned, blue-eyed American actors. This was too much for the fans. Their rage on internet forums coalesced into a dedicated pressure group, calling themselves Racebending. &quot;We grew to an organised website, a Facebook page, we got volunteers, and we spent time reaching out to press and TV, we got a lot of coverage. It became a national and international issue,&quot; says Michael Le, one of Racebending&apos;s team of volunteers. M Night Shyamalan, who is\u00a0of Indian descent and has regularly cast Asian actors in his previous films, defended the casting in the name of &quot;diversity&quot; (the creators of the cartoon series, by the way, were two white Americans). In response to the negative publicity, though, the film-makers replaced one of the white actors with an Asian one \u2013 Dev Patel, of Slumdog Millionaire fame. But the move did little to defuse the situation, especially since Patel&apos;s character was the story&apos;s villain, and a\u00a0&quot;Boycott The Last Airbender&quot; campaign was launched. &quot;We don&apos;t take credit for The Last Airbender&apos;s failure,&quot; says Le. &quot;The movie being terrible was the main factor in that. But what we were successful at was changing the context of the conversations about the movie. It was very difficult to write a review or an article about the movie that did not mention the casting controversy, and M Night himself was forced to respond to the question several times, much to his frustration. So maybe they&apos;ll think twice next time.&quot; Or maybe not. Racebending, whose adopted term is synonymous with &quot;race-lifting&quot;, still has its work cut out. Asian-generated fantasy and science-fiction stories are particularly susceptible to race-lifting/bending. It also happened with 2009&apos;s Dragonball Evolution, the live-action Hollywood adaptation of one of Japan&apos;s most popular anime series. Again, the lead actors were played by Caucasian actors. And it is about to happen again with a new version of legendary manga Akira. The cast announced so far is led by Garret Hedlund, hero of the recent Tron Legacy, and includes Gary Oldman and Helena Bonham Carter. The entire story of Akira has been race-lifted from the original&apos;s Neo-Tokyo, to &quot;Neo-Manhattan&quot;. &quot;Whitewashing&quot; or &quot;race-bending&quot; is problematic specifically because of the tiny number of roles that actors of colour are allowed to try out for,&quot; says Latoya Peterson, owner and editor of Racialicious, an online blog exploring &quot;the intersection of race and culture. &quot;This is the idea of under-representation that all minorities struggle against \u2013 that while competition for parts is stiff for everyone, many are written explicitly for white actors and actresses. Hollywood, and the film industry at large, seem to think that brown faces aren&apos;t sellable. This despite Will Smith currently being the most bankable star in Hollywood. That&apos;s why it&apos;s a problem.&quot; Race-lifting is starting to work the other way round, however. If you are a\u00a0big enough non-white actor, like Will\u00a0Smith, you can play characters originally written as white \u2013 as he did in Men in Black, Wild, Wild West and I Am Legend. Morgan Freeman has done the same. His roles in The Shawshank Redemption and Gone Baby Gone were both originally written as Irish. Samuel L Jackson is another. He has played a recurring character, Nick Fury, in Marvel&apos;s recent run of comic-book films \u2013 Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and next year&apos;s The Avengers. In the 60s comics, Nick Fury was originally white, but when Marvel revamped its superhero line in 2000, he was redrawn as an African-American, deliberately based on Jackson. Marvel&apos;s progressive race-lifting has not been without its controversies either, though. In what could be seen as the flipside to Racebending&apos;s Last Airbender protest, this year&apos;s Thor movie started another racial-casting row by having Idris Elba as the Norse god Heimdall. Never mind that this was a minor character in a special-effects fantasy, the prospect of Elba, a British actor of Ghanaian and Sierra Leonian descent, playing the &quot;whitest of the gods&quot; was simply unacceptable to some. &quot;It&apos;s not enough that Marvel attacks conservative values, now mythological Gods must be re-invented with black skin,&quot; railed the Council of Conservative Citizens, an extreme rightwing American pressure group which described Elba as a &quot;hip-hop DJ&quot;. &quot;It seems that Marvel Studios\u00a0believes that white people should have nothing that is unique to\u00a0themselves.&quot; The bemused Elba defended himself by pointing out\u00a0the obvious: &quot;Thor has a\u00a0hammer that flies to him when he clicks his fingers. That&apos;s OK, but the colour of my skin is wrong?&quot; The CoCC indignantly organised its own &quot;Boycott Thor&quot; campaign, although the threat of America&apos;s racist contingent not showing up did little to deter the rest of the populace; Thor has been one of the year&apos;s biggest box office hits. It is telling that Thor&apos;s director was our very own Kenneth Branagh, whose background in British theatre no doubt familiarised him with these issues. Similar race-lifting battles were fought, won and altogether overcome on the stage at least a decade ago. In 2000, Adrian Lester played the first black Hamlet on the British stage, and David Oyewolo the first black Shakespearean monarch (Henry VI), and race-lifting is now commonplace \u2013 as with Debbie Allen&apos;s recent all-black Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Branagh had already cast Lester in his film of Love&apos;s Labour&apos;s Lost in 2000, and both Lester and Oyewolo were in his big-screen As You Like It in 2006. Even back in 1993, Branagh&apos;s casting of Denzel Washington as Don Pedro in Much Ado About Nothing caused nowhere near as much controversy his decision to put Keanu Reeves in it. Does this counter-race-lifting even the odds? Does it suggest we are actually approaching some post-racial future where the idea of inequality is as quaint as blackface? You could say Hollywood itself is keen to promote this narrative, looking at the success of\u00a0racial feelgood hits such as The Help and The Blind Side, whose message seems to be &quot;isn&apos;t it great how we&apos;re not as racist as we used\u00a0to\u00a0be?&quot; Peterson is not so optimistic. &quot;Historically, white roles being played by actors of colour is a very small way of trying to rectify a very large problem,&quot; she says. &quot;Ideally, roles would be written and distributed more equally, so that changing the race of an actor wouldn&apos;t be as big of a deal as it is. As a solution to the systemic exclusion of actors of colour, race-lifting is imperfect. But in terms of rethinking how we view art, it\u00a0is amazing. When people stage productions like an all-black Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, it helps to reframe the stories told about blackness and whiteness. It&apos;s one of the contradictions of art; since there is so much room to\u00a0play with convention, completely unintended things happen. Art, in many ways, is a\u00a0constant conversation. Race-lifting is\u00a0one way to invite more people to\u00a0participate.&quot; Which brings us back to Wuthering Heights. Part of Heathcliff&apos;s enduring appeal is arguably his ethnic indeterminacy, both in terms of his own conflicted identity and the way he is perceived by others. People do not know what to make of him, a fact that Arnold has recognised in her film. &quot;I\u00a0think the only reason people are surprised is that they&apos;ve just seen white Heathcliffs all the time and I don&apos;t think anyone&apos;s really concentrated on the text,&quot; she recently said, noting Bront\u00eb&apos;s ambiguous descriptions of the character. &quot;I decided that&apos;s really where the truth was. What really mattered was his difference, his exoticness. That was mainly what I thought was really important.&quot; Through Heathcliff, Wuthering Heights unsettled formerly stable boundaries of 19th-century Britain, including racial ones, and it is apparently still doing it today. You could see Heathcliff as the first post-racial hero \u2013 coping with a world that wasn&apos;t yet ready for him, and still isn&apos;t."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/14/technocrats-europe-bad-politics-economics", "publicationDate": "2011-11-14T21:00:00Z", "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Europe", "Greece", "Italy", "Lucas Papademos", "Mario Monti", "Politics", "Science", "Psychology"], "sentences": ["In his book 23 Things They Don&apos;t Tell You About Capitalism, the Cambridge economist Ha-Joon Chang points out that in recent history economic policy in Japan, Taiwan, China and South Korea has largely been set by lawyers or engineers."], "title": "Letting technocrats run Europe is bad politics and bad economics | Aditya Chakrabortty", "article": "Consider for a moment the injured feelings of the plutocrat. He&apos;s the target of round-the-clock protests stretching from Oakland to Norwich. He&apos;s denounced by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Goodness, even those carefully-placed &quot;news&quot; stories about how George Osborne must scrap his tax on the super-rich, which once commanded at least a respectful audience, now meet with the puzzled mirth of a country that suspects a wind-up. At this point the penny loafer drops: they&apos;re called the 1% because they&apos;re lonely. But through every cold weather front a little sunshine must peep. Which is why the gym-buffed corporate financiers, the chauffeured captains of industry and all the others whose membership subs are simply too big to qualify for the 99% club must have managed a brave little smile at the past week&apos;s changes of regime in Italy and Greece. Because that swap of Silvio with Mario, Papandreou with Papademos, shows that however much fashionable opprobrium is now being dumped on the results of free-market fundamentalism, the arguments used to justify it remain powerful. Over the past few days, the debate over the usurpation of democratic leaders in southern Europe by unelected technocrats has run thus: general rejoicing at the deposal of Berlusconi; a little light brow-furrowing over what this says about the eurozone&apos;s respect for the will of its people, and much use of phrases such as &quot;safe pair of hands&quot;. The consensus has been that this is politically bad (subtext: then again, those wobbly southern European democracies do need their stabiliser wheels); but probably for the best economically. Which is the sort of argument to cheer up neoliberals everywhere, implicitly accepting as it does that they have the best tools to run an economy. Even the term technocrat is extraordinary: it pretends to divorce economics from politics, when all that happens is that vulgar material interests are disguised under a luxurious tablecloth. So let me sketch out why these assumptions are wrong: why the imposition of unelected officials at the head of two European governments is both bad politics and bad economics. None of this is intended to defend Berlusconi, whose only justification on the world stage was as a long-running experiment into what happens when you crossbreed Benny Hill with Vladimir Putin. Nor am I especially bothered about the loss of George Papandreou, who is the sort of weak-chinned social democrat that any observer of New Labour will be heartily tired of. But nor can their successors Mario Monti and Lucas Papademos be passed off as ideologically neutral technicians. Until this weekend, Monti served as an adviser to the world&apos;s number one investment bank, Goldman Sachs. As for Papademos, his biggest political intervention before becoming prime minister was to argue against the recent eurozone deal to write off half of Greece&apos;s debts \u2013 it should, he claimed, be a far smaller discount, so as not to hurt banks. One man was a banker, the other defended their interests, and yet the claim is that they have shed those prejudices in the past few hours. This is about as likely as Bob Diamond being made chancellor, and declaring war on the wealth gap. And it matters because one big question that will dominate Greek and Italian politics for years to come is who foots the bill for their country&apos;s financial troubles: the bankers or the pensioners, students and public servants? Another big issue is how far either country will stand up to the demands of northern Europe \u2013 and both newly-minted leaders already have form here: Monti was an EU commissioner; Papademos worked at the European Central Bank. You may say, at least these are fully-trained economists, able to spot the right policies for their countries. Except that the Greeks are already doing pretty much what they were told by the eurozone&apos;s economic officialdom \u2013 and it isn&apos;t working. Under the tutelage of the rest of the EU and the IMF, Papandreou pulled off one of the biggest fiscal consolidations in postwar history \u2013 with the result that Greece sank into a depression and its borrowing rose further. And there&apos;s plenty of evidence that having an economist run your country&apos;s economic policy is no help whatsoever. Last week, Joachim Wehner of the LSE and Mark Hallerberg of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin published some research that looked at educational backgrounds of political leaders across Europe. Since 1973, 69% of Greek finance ministers and 55% of those in Portugal have had a PhD in economics; a qualification unknown to any British chancellor. In his book 23 Things They Don&apos;t Tell You About Capitalism, the Cambridge economist Ha-Joon Chang points out that in recent history economic policy in Japan, Taiwan, China and South Korea has largely been set by lawyers or engineers. In India and Pakistan on the other hand, many world-class economists have been in charge of the treasury \u2013 yet their record have been no match for the Asian tiger economies. The euro is perhaps the high point of doing economics without any ostensible politics. Until its crisis, the euro was a technocrats&apos; triumph, a prime example of doing economics without any ostensible politics. As is now widely pointed out, the single currency was launched without significant political institutions behind it, let alone a common treasury. The result we now know about; and yet the governments of Europe seem keen to run the experiment in Greece and Italy all over again."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/17/obama-pacific-tour-south-china-sea", "publicationDate": "2011-11-17T21:52:21Z", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "US foreign policy", "Japan", "Barack Obama", "South China Sea"], "sentences": ["He began as a president who put his first visit to China ahead of meeting the Dalai Lama, who delayed military sales to Taiwan, and who soft-pedalled on human rights."], "title": "Obama's Pacific tour: South China Sea change | editorial", "article": "He began as a president who put his first visit to China ahead of meeting the Dalai Lama, who delayed military sales to Taiwan, and who soft-pedalled on human rights. This week a sea change occurred in Barack&apos;s Obama&apos;s rhetoric on China. Each stopover on a nine-day tour through the Pacific ended with a fresh dig at China. In Honolulu, Mr Obama demanded that China &quot;play by the rules&quot; in international trade and &quot;act like a grownup&quot;. In Canberra, he said the US was &quot;here to stay as a Pacific power&quot;, a day after announcing he would send military aircraft and 2,500 marines to train at Darwin, in Australia&apos;s Northern Territory. While each statement was tempered with caveats \u2013 he praised China&apos;s role in reining in North Korea and preventing proliferation \u2013 the message was clear: don&apos;t write us off after Iraq and Afghanistan; the US is pushing back as a Pacific power. This is not so much a sea change as a South China Sea change. This is a maritime region, rich in energy and fisheries resources, which China claims as its own. In recent years Chinese vessels have locked horns with Japanese coastguards, and Vietnamese and Philippine trawlers. These are not casual encounters. China says it has a right to secure its sea lanes. Japanese analysts say the strategic aim of these probes, territorial disputes over uninhabited islands, and China&apos;s decision to build up to four aircraft carrier battle groups, is to gain the power of interdiction up to the &quot;second island chain&quot; of the Pacific (which includes the US territory of Guam). These are busy waters. Half the world&apos;s tonnage flows through these navigation lanes. They are also potential sources of major energy reserves. Before Mr Obama&apos;s salvo this week, China was considering resuming talks with Japan on a treaty which would see a joint gas drilling project in the East China Sea. The talks had stalled after Japanese coastguards arrested a Chinese trawler captain near the disputed Senkaku islands. China is hoping to stabilise relations with Japan ahead of a leadership change in next year&apos;s Chinese Communist party congress but, like Mr Obama, they are vulnerable to hawks in the runup to an election year. The US&apos;s plans for a Trans-Pacific Partnership will do nothing to calm Chinese nerves. This is a free trade pact of 12 Pacific nations from which China is de facto excluded over the very issues \u2013 the value of its currency, protection of foreign property rights and subsidies to state-owned companies \u2013 which have become bones of bilateral contention. Hillary Clinton wrote this week that a thriving China and a thriving America were good for each other. It is harder to see how that will be achieved, as competition stokes nationalism on both sides of the ocean."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/nov/23/nokia-lumia-800-iphone-4s", "publicationDate": "2011-11-23T09:36:59Z", "tags": ["Nokia", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Apple", "Telecoms", "Technology", "Telecommunications industry", "Business"], "sentences": ["Lee Simpson at Jefferies bank is suggesting a 1m estimate based on orders from component-makers and the Lumia&apos;s Taiwan manufacturer, Compal.", "The Lumia will be rolled out to Hong Kong, India, Russia, Singapore and Taiwan before the end of the year, but will not reach further markets, such as the US and China, until 2012."], "title": "Nokia Lumia 800 'set to trail iPhone 4S'", "article": "Nokia&apos;s Lumia 800 handset, billed as the Finnish manufacturer&apos;s make-or-break return to the smartphone race, is set to sell fewer units by Christmas than Apple took in pre-orders in a single day for its latest iPhone.

Pacific Crest, the US technology investment bank, suggested on Tuesday that Nokia&apos;s future is not yet secure. &quot;We believe that shipments of Nokia&apos;s new Windsows Phone 7 have been lower than we had previously anticipated,&quot; said Pacific Crest analyst James Faucette. &quot;We had expected that the company could ship as many as 2m units into the six targeted markets for the holidays; however, we now believe that those shipments are likely to be less than 1m for the quarter.&quot; Faucette said checks with retailers indicated &quot;disappointing&quot; sales so far and that the total number of phones sold to customers, as opposed to shipped to retailers, could total no more than 500,000 by the end of December. Lee Simpson at Jefferies bank is suggesting a 1m estimate based on orders from component-makers and the Lumia&apos;s Taiwan manufacturer, Compal. Simpson said: &quot;My impression is the first weekend wasn&apos;t terrific but it wasn&apos;t an outright disaster. The pre-ordering was a good bit lower than 500,000; my estimate by Christmas is that 1m sales would be achievable. It&apos;s too early to write this off right now, although the temptation is there.&quot; The Lumia is only on sale in six markets, while the N8 was available across Europe and in selected Asian markets during its first months.

Peninsula, one of Asia&apos;s most prestigious hotel chains, said on Monday it would no longer sell the dishes, considered a delicacy in Hong Kong and other parts of the region, &quot;in recognition of the threat facing the global shark population and in line with the company&apos;s sustainability vision&quot;. The move will affect the group&apos;s nine hotels, including those in China and Hong Kong, the center of the global shark fin market. Hong Kong handles between 50% and 80% of the global trade in shark fins, bringing in catches from more than 100 countries, with Spain its biggest supplier. In 2006 it took delivery of more than 10,000 tonnes worth US$276m, according to the UN food and agricultural organisation. Most is consumed in Hong Kong and Taiwan, but also in mainland provinces such as Guangdong, where its consumption has become a status symbol among China&apos;s nouveau riche. Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels, which owns the Peninsula group, said it would honour requests for shark fin soup made before 21 November, for consumption after 1 January. The dish, which comprises pieces of rehydrated shark fin in a rich broth, is a popular staple at wedding parties and formal banquets, with a serving for 12 people costing around US$138. In Hong Kong districts such as Sheung Wan, which specialises in dried seafood, premium shark fin can fetch up to US$1,280 per kilo. One Sheung Wan wholesaler recently told the Guardian, however, that the market price had dropped by about 20% in the past two months, partly as a result of the campaign. About 73 million sharks are killed every year, and the appetite for their fins in places such as Hong Kong has taken one in three shark species to the brink of extinction. &quot;By removing shark fin from our menus, we hope that our decision can contribute to preserving the marine ecosystem for the world&apos;s future generations,&quot; the Peninsula group&apos;s chief executive, Clement Kwok, said in a statement. &quot;As Asia&apos;s oldest hotel company, we also hope that our decision will inspire other hospitality companies to do the same.&quot; Other luxury hotel chains have attempted to reduce shark fin consumption by offering alternative menus for wedding banquets, sometimes with inducements such as a free night&apos;s accommodation for the newlyweds. The push to remove the delicacy \u2013 prized more for its glutinous texture than for its taste \u2013 has gathered momentum after a slow start, according to World Wildlife Fund, which has seen 97 caterers and hotels sign up to its alternative shark-free menu in the past year. A 2010 survey of eating habits by Bloom Association, a marine conservation group, found that despite the dish&apos;s central place in Cantonese cuisine, attitudes were shifting, particularly among younger people. According to Bloom, 66% of Hong Kong diners said they were uncomfortable with the idea of eating an endangered species, and more than three-quarters said they would not mind if it was removed from banquet menus. The Peninsula announcement came as the European commission called for a global ban on shark finning \u2013 the practice of cutting off a shark&apos;s fin and throwing its body back into the sea \u2013 by EU fishermen. EU countries are responsible for about 14% \u2013 the second-largest share \u2013 of the global shark catch."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/nov/28/htc-smartphone-sales-halt-germany", "publicationDate": "2011-11-28T07:46:49Z", "tags": ["Smartphones", "Intellectual property", "Samsung", "Apple", "iPhone", "Technology", "Nokia", "Mobile phones", "Telecommunications industry", "Telecoms", "Business", "Technology sector", "HTC"], "sentences": ["The Taiwanese technology company HTC faces the bleak prospect of seeing sales of all its smartphones blocked from sale in Germany during the crucial Christmas period, after it withdrew its objections to a patent claim won by the German firm IPCom in February 2009 in a Mannheim court.", "Nokia missed out on the smartphone market from the very beginning, and didn&apos;t develop applications as well as Apple.&quot; For a decade, Taiwan&apos;s HTC quietly made phones for others to sell, but then decided to push its own brand in late 2006."], "title": "HTC phone sales face halt in Germany", "article": "The Taiwanese technology company HTC faces the bleak prospect of seeing sales of all its smartphones blocked from sale in Germany during the crucial Christmas period, after it withdrew its objections to a patent claim won by the German firm IPCom in February 2009 in a Mannheim court. HTC&apos;s appeal against the 2009 decision was due to be decided on this week. Its withdrawal means that the fourth-largest smartphone maker in the world could see its sales halted in the country. IPCom said in a statement that it &quot;now intends to execute this injunction in the shortest possible time&quot; and that: &quot;We will use the right awarded by the courts, likely resulting in HTC devices disappearing from shops during the crucial Christmas season.&quot; The announcement comes just weeks after HTC warned that its revenues could fall by much more the 8% in this quarter compared to the third quarter due to intensifying competition in the smartphone market from Samsung and Apple at the high end, and Chinese mainland companies at the low end. To some, it indicates that the company faces a serious challenge to its future growth. HTC claimed that its appeal would have been redundant, as a German patent court has questioned the validity of the patent in the 2009 decision. IPCom acquired Bosch&apos;s mobile telephony patent portfolio, created between the mid-1980s and 2000, which includes about 160 patent families worldwide, including some of the key patents in the wireless industry \u2013 such as &quot;patent 100&quot;, which standardises a mobile phone&apos;s first connection to a network. IPCom has battled for years against HTC and the giant Finnish mobile company Nokia in European courts. Analysts and lawyers said HTC&apos;s withdrawal gives it time to battle against two other patents which could have been decided upon next week, while it can still try to delay the original injunction. However, the German patent expert and blogger Florian M\u00fcller said that &quot;while HTC can try to oppose the enforcement of the injunction, my research shows that the odds are very long against HTC on this one&quot;.  The sales disruption in Germany, one of Europe&apos;s largest smartphone markets \u2013 but where penetration is still only around 30%, indicating huge potential for growth \u2013 comes at a time when HTC is struggling to hold on to its position on the smartphone market. &quot;This represents an unwelcome distraction during an already difficult quarter for HTC,&quot; said CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber. Late last month, HTC warned that revenue would fall by up to 8% in October-December from the third quarter, and this week it flagged a much bigger drop, citing tougher competition and the global downturn. HTC&apos;s stock has fallen 30% in eight straight trading days. With Nokia&apos;s fall from market dominance still fresh in the memory, and BlackBerry maker Research in Motion losing ground, HTC needs to recapture its innovative drive to make sure it maintains its position, say analysts. &quot;It won&apos;t be easy for HTC to get out of the mess it&apos;s in right now,&quot; said Simon Liu, deputy investment officer at Polaris Group&apos;s fund unit. &quot;Still, it&apos;s not the end of HTC. It&apos;s certainly not another Nokia. Nokia missed out on the smartphone market from the very beginning, and didn&apos;t develop applications as well as Apple.&quot; For a decade, Taiwan&apos;s HTC quietly made phones for others to sell, but then decided to push its own brand in late 2006. In the year to April, its shares more than tripled after its innovative designs played well with shoppers. Sales of phone models including Desire, Sensation, Wildfire, Rhyme and ChaCha grew fourfold in just 18 months, and in the third quarter of this year it sold more smartphones in the US than any of its rivals. But its cracking performance is sputtering as it fails to bring out new products to rival the iPhone and Samsung&apos;s Galaxy in the high-end smartphone market. Closer to home, China&apos;s ZTE and Huawei Technologies Co are turning out smartphones that sell for as little as $100 (\u00a365) to target the low end of the business, a fast-growth market that HTC so far has largely avoided. &quot;It lacks a star smartphone,&quot; said CK Lu, an analyst with research firm Gartner in Taipei. &quot;If you put HTC phones all in a line, you won&apos;t be able to differentiate the products too clearly, unlike Samsung&apos;s Galaxy 2 or the iPhone. In China, for example, consumers won&apos;t be able to differentiate HTC phones from a slew of others, such as the China-made ones, and that&apos;s where HTC is facing some problems.&quot; HTC, valued at around $14bn, saw a bigger buildup of unsold inventory than rivals in the third quarter, a portent of weak sales in the crucial year-end holiday season. &quot;Aside from rising competition from Apple and Samsung in the high-end market, aggressive price competition from Huawei and ZTE at the lower-end could put further pressure on HTC&apos;s margin,&quot; said Laura Chen, analyst at BNP Paribas. &quot;We believe HTC is reviewing its product roadmap to regain market share in 2012. However, most of its new products are to be launched only late in the first quarter.&quot; HTC is also re-evaluating its $300m acquisition of S3 Graphics after the graphics technology firm lost a legal battle in the US against Apple, which raises the spectre that HTC products could be banned from the US \u2013 where it earns half its revenue. HTC had planned to buy S3 to beef up its defences in its own separate lawsuit battle with Apple. &quot;Winning the lawsuit has made it possible for Apple to squeeze HTC by the neck in future,&quot; said Liu at Polaris. HTC was the company that infuriated Steve Jobs, Apple&apos;s late co-founder and chief executive, when in January 2010 it introduced an Android phone that he alleged assimilated a number of iPhone features. On seeing it he told Eric Schmidt, then chief executive of Google, that he would try to wipe out Android. However the iPCom lawsuit has been running since long before that, and there is no indication that Apple was involved in its inception. HTC&apos;s shares are down more than 60% in six months, making it the worst performer among major handset firms, along with RIM. Shares in LG Electronics are down 36% and Nokia 29%. Samsung and Apple both rose around 9% in that period. Five analysts now have &quot;sell&quot; ratings on HTC, up from two just a month ago. The number of &quot;buy&quot; recommendations has dropped to nine from 13, Thomson Reuters StarMine data showed. HTC shares fell by the most allowed in one day last Friday, dropping nearly 7% for a second consecutive session. The company, which had 10.8% global market share in the third quarter, sold only 1m more phones than RIM, and its market share gap with bigger rivals is expected to widen as Nokia fights back with its first Windows Phone-based models. &quot;HTC hasn&apos;t offered enough new models, and hasn&apos;t been aggressive in its pricing strategy,&quot; Barclays analyst Dale Gai wrote in a client note. &quot;We believe Samsung leads HTC in most high-end models, including LTE phones, where HTC has failed to compete on form factor.&quot; Gartner&apos;s Lu, however, sees little risk of HTC going the way of Nokia. &quot;Basically, HTC is on the right track, but it will take time for its brand- and retail-building. It&apos;s in way better shape than LG, RIM and Motorola. But it&apos;s true it&apos;s not as competitive as Apple or Samsung.&quot; Annie Lu, a spokeswoman for HTC, said the company remained confident about driving new technologies. &quot;HTC has a strong and complete portfolio in both high-end/premium and mass market high quality products,&quot; she told Reuters. &quot;With our US operator partners, we have launched premium products such as HTC Rezound (with Verizon Wireless) and HTC Vivid (with AT&amp;T), with high customer satisfaction ratings. In the mass market sector, HTC Wildfire has been a big hit this year, and we expect strong sales with the HTC Explorer launch.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/nov/28/south-korea-development-model", "publicationDate": "2011-11-28T12:27:13Z", "tags": ["Aid effectiveness", "Global development", "Aid", "South Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["Located at the southernmost tip of the Korean peninsula, Busan not only boasts a mammoth department store, the world&apos;s biggest \u2013 overtaking Macy&apos;s in New York two years ago \u2013 it also plans on having the world&apos;s third-tallest building in 2013, after Burj Khalifa in Dubai and Taipei 101 in Taipei, Taiwan."], "title": "South Korea: a model of development? | Mark Tran", "article": "It may not be the prettiest seaside resort, with its drab tower blocks looming over the beach, but South Korea&apos;s second-largest city does not lack civic ambition.

On Tuesday, Busan hosts the fourth high-level forum on aid effectiveness, when more than 2,000 delegates, with star turns from Hillary Clinton and Tony Blair, descend on the vast Bexco conference centre, where workers were still putting the finishing touches to its layout at the weekend. Busan and South Korea rightly take great pride in hosting this conference, and the South Korean government believes others can learn from its development experience. Echoes here of Turkey, host of this year&apos;s least-developed countries conference in Istanbul, when it banged on about the importance of the private sector in its own development. After the Korean war, South Korea was one of the world&apos;s poorest countries with only $64 per capita income. Economically, in the 1960s it lagged behind the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) \u2013 currently holding elections marred by violence . Since then the country&apos;s fortunes have diverged spectacularly. South Korea now belongs to the rich man&apos;s club, the OECD development assistance committee (DAC). The DRC has gone backwards since independence and, out of 187 countries, ranked bottom in the 2011 Human Development Index. South Korea, however, benefited from big injections of foreign aid, first from the US, then Japan. A briefing paper from KoFID, a South Korean network of civil society organisations, and ReDI, a South Korean thinktank, points out that the US offered about $60bn in grants and loans to South Korea between 1946 and 1978. In the same period, the total amount of aid provided by the US to the entire African continent was $68.9bn. Korea \u2013 considered by the US an important ally during the cold war \u2013 indisputedly used the aid well. Seoul was not afraid to stand up to the US when they differed on development strategy as well. In a foretaste of the current debate on &quot;ownership&quot;, South Korea was not prepared to play second fiddle to the US and insisted on pursuing its own course. Aid was linked to South Korea&apos;s planning and budget process, one of the principles set out in the Paris declaration on aid effectiveness in 2005 and expected to be reaffirmed in Busan. South Korea, under strongman Park Chung-Hee, focused on building up large economic champions, or chaebols (business conglomerates), against American advice to focus on small- and medium-sized companies. That policy laid the foundation for successful South Korean brands in the world market, such as Samsung and LG, although it came at a price in terms of political corruption in the close ties between business and political elites. KoFID and ReDI argue that the focus on conglomerates led to the chaebols exploiting their monopoly status, fostering increasing economic inequality. Park took a pragmatic approach to corruption. Instead of cracking down on corrupt businessmen as urged by the US, he expropriated their bank shares and assigned them to invest in import-substitution industries, such as fertilisers, a point made in Catalysing Development, a book on aid edited by Homi Kharas, Koji Makino and Woojin Jung. Whatever its faults, the South Korean regime did not squander the aid it received, unlike Mobutu in the DRC&apos;s previous incarnation, Zaire. As the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank looked the other way, Mobutu looted the country, building himself palatial follies in his mother&apos;s home village in the remote bush in Gbadolite, complete with an airport that could accommodate Concorde for shopping trips the Mobutu clan would make to Paris or New York. While the DRC stands out as a model of development to be shunned, South Korea, as well as Vietnam provide pointers on how development should be done. Once again, Vietnam underlines the importance of ownership. The government, rather than donors, set out the poverty reduction agenda and at times has rejected the advice of international institutions. Vietnam allowed its programme with the IMF to lapse over disagreements with the pace of financial sector reform and audits of the central bank. Ownership cuts both ways, however. Vietnam, like a number of developing countries that have overseen considerable progress, has a strong authoritarian streak, recently jailing a French-Vietnamese blogger. Rwanda, Ethiopia and Cambodia also spring to mind in this context. A primary concern of civil society groups in Busan is the increasing use of legislation to crack down on NGO activity. Cambodia is discussing an NGO law that civil society groups fear could further stifle dissent in a society with minimal political opposition, although there are signs the regime is backtracking under international pressure. Meanwhile, some Ethiopians say civil society has been virtually strangled since the introduction of an NGO law in Ethiopia in 2009. Campaigners are hoping to hear a strong message of support from Clinton for civil society when she speaks on Wednesday. As for South Korea, KoFID and ReDI say the government has not given enough importance to the role of civil society in the country&apos;s successful path to development. &quot;Decades of suffering and sacrifice were endured by most of the population: the small business people, labourers and farmers,&quot; KoFID and ReDI argue. &quot;It was their push for a democratic civil society in Korea that lay behind the stable development of the country.&quot; It is an assertion open to debate, but Tunisia, Egypt and the Arab spring show the dangers of not spreading the benefits of economic growth evenly."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/nov/29/htc-stop-smartphone-sales-germany", "publicationDate": "2011-11-29T08:31:03Z", "tags": ["Smartphones", "Android", "Google", "Samsung", "Germany", "Technology", "Intellectual property", "Mobile phones", "Telecommunications industry", "Business", "Telecoms", "HTC"], "sentences": ["German patent firm IPCom has ordered HTC to stop sales and distribution of all its smartphones in Germany, saying the Taiwanese firm faces fines if it does not comply.", "We&apos;re confident in them.&quot; But investors are concerned that HTC, one of few Taiwanese firms with a global brand, is not changing radically enough.", "That paid off earlier, making HTC a market darling and sending its shares to a record high in April, helping founder Cher Wang top the Forbes rich-list for Taiwan this year.", "&quot;Actually, if it wasn&apos;t because of national pride, Samsung would have outsold HTC in Taiwan by now.&quot; Yung gave no details about the models HTC is banking on to wow buyers next year, but noted the company would focus on China \u2013 a market HTC has been slow to push into as it has traditionally focused on high-end users, while Chinese sales are driven by low-cost phones."], "title": "HTC told to stop selling its smartphones in Germany", "article": "German patent firm IPCom has ordered HTC to stop sales and distribution of all its smartphones in Germany, saying the Taiwanese firm faces fines if it does not comply. &quot;If HTC fails to comply, and continues to sell UMTS-capable devices, IPCom will initiate a so-called &apos;Zwangsgeldverfahren&apos; under German law, which will result in fines being levied until it complies,&quot; IPCom said in a statement. HTC sells around 2m smartphones a year in Germany, according to the research firm IDC. That compares to an expected world total for the company of around 45m this year. IPCom said last week it would enforce an injunction based on a Mannheim court decision from February 2009 after HTC, the fourth largest smartphone vendor globally, withdrew its appeal, which was due to be decided this week. HTC said the legal battle would have no impact on its business in Germany because the injunction covered only one HTC handset \u2013 which is no longer sold in that country \u2013 and it has also modified its implementation of the UMTS standards. But IPCom hit back: &quot;HTC&apos;s claim that it is business as usual in Germany is utterly misleading,&quot; Bernhard Frohwitter, managing director of IPCom, said in a statement. &quot;Fact is: the patent in question is valid, and the Mannheim ruling of February 2009 covers all HTC 3G devices, since the patent covers a mandatory 3G standard, valid for all devices and networks.&quot; The legal challenges, allied to warnings from HTC that it will not grow its revenues this quarter compared to those of a year ago \u2013 and so see a quarter-on-quarter fall \u2013 have led some investors to lose faith in the company. Its shares have fallen more than 30% in less than two weeks. Its Desire, Sensation and Wildfire models have lost ground to Apple&apos;s iPhones and Samsung&apos;s Galaxy line-up, prompting calls for a change of tack in a fast-moving and fickle market.  In his first response to the battering from stock markets, HTC chief financial officer Winston Yung told Reuters on Monday that the company is not another Nokia. The Finnish mobile firm experienced a rapid fall from market dominance as nimbler rivals overtook its stolid product lineups. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s so serious,&quot; Yung said, noting that even the most conservative guidance is for shipments to increase to 45m units this year, from 25m last year. &quot;We will focus on the product next year, better and more competitive. Other than new LTE phones for the US market, we have phones for the global market. We will launch some worldwide flagship products. We&apos;re confident in them.&quot; But investors are concerned that HTC, one of few Taiwanese firms with a global brand, is not changing radically enough. &quot;Its industrial design hasn&apos;t changed for almost two years. Unless it launches a really different phone, it&apos;s hard to sell the product at a premium price,&quot; said Roxy Wong, analyst at Mirae Asset Management in Hong Kong. &quot;HTC lacks an edge in branding against Apple and Samsung. It has stronger hardware specs against Apple, but not Samsung. It takes time for a company to enhance branding, so the room left for HTC to improve sales is not much unless it starts cutting prices.&quot; Apart from BlackBerry maker Research in Motion, HTC shares are the worst performers among smartphone peers this year, down 62% from a lifetime high in late April, as sales growth has slowed and investors have been spooked by two profit warnings. RIM&apos;s shares are down 70% this year. &quot;Smartphone market growth is expected to slow down with each passing year, and HTC has to face a resurgent Motorola, Nokia and Sony,&quot; said Abhishek Chauhan, principal consultant at ICT Practice of Frost &amp; Sullivan. &quot;So they have a real risk of becoming another RIM or LG, if they don&apos;t refresh their product line-up quickly.&quot; Concerns heightened last week when HTC cut its revenue forecast for the fourth quarter to no growth, shocking a market used to double- and even triple-digit growth rates. About four times the normal number of HTC shares changed hands on Friday in what was the stock&apos;s busiest day for 27 months. Yung said investors have &quot;questions&quot; for the company, but HTC is explaining its strategy and reiterating its confidence, and sees no change in strategy for now. On Monday, HTC shares fell 3.7% to T$471.50 (\u00a310). CEO Peter Chou explained to Reuters in an interview in July that the thinking behind the strategy was &quot;whatever customers prefer, we make sure we have a product for them&quot;. That paid off earlier, making HTC a market darling and sending its shares to a record high in April, helping founder Cher Wang top the Forbes rich-list for Taiwan this year. In its first 10 years from its founding in 1997, HTC evolved from a contract manufacturer for brands such as Siemens and Vodafone to a brand in its own right. Its corporate slogan, Quietly Brilliant, reflects a culture of avoiding the limelight \u2013 its head office is tucked away at the end of a long driveway in an old industrial suburb of Taipei \u2013 yet fostering innovation and speed. It will need that as rivals, too, pick up speed, and will have to do it without their highly regarded innovation chief Horace Luke, who left in April. &quot;HTC has an ID problem \u2013 customers are struggling to distinguish between their phones,&quot; said Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight in London. Richard Ko, an analyst at KGI Securities in Taipei, said he expects HTC&apos;s quarter-on-quarter shipments to continue declining next quarter, and predicts in the first half of 2012 shipments will fall also from a year ago. A sales assistant at an HTC store in northern Taipei, who asked not to be named, said the brand had won customers as it had been the first to launch an Android phone. &quot;But the trend is shifting and now Samsung is catching up,&quot; she said. &quot;Actually, if it wasn&apos;t because of national pride, Samsung would have outsold HTC in Taiwan by now.&quot; Yung gave no details about the models HTC is banking on to wow buyers next year, but noted the company would focus on China \u2013 a market HTC has been slow to push into as it has traditionally focused on high-end users, while Chinese sales are driven by low-cost phones. Apple has already launched a low-cost version of its iPhone in China and home-grown rivals ZTE and Huawei Technologies are muscling in with cheaper phones. Samsung and Nokia already dominate smartphone sales there. In a recent report, brokerage firm Macquarie said it expected HTC to focus on superphones, with high resolution screens and fast processors, for the high-end, while offering more stylish mid- and low-end models to non-US markets. &quot;We think it&apos;s too early to assume such a strategy will work,&quot; the broker said, noting for example that the screens HTC wants to use are a technology of fierce rival Samsung. ICT&apos;s Chauhan said HTC &quot;has definitely fallen behind the top of the pack&quot;, but the margin isn&apos;t that big. &quot;The key issue is to get the product strategy right,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/29/taiwan-election-candidates", "publicationDate": "2011-11-29T14:02:00Z", "tags": ["World news", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific", "Politics"], "sentences": ["Forget Christmas: if you&apos;re a Taiwanese activist, the best time to open your presents is during a close presidential election race likely to be won on the margins.", "Ahead of January&apos;s polls, nationalist Kuomintang incumbent Ma Ying-jeou and chief rival Democratic Progressive party chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen have ditched the traditional Taiwanese political playbook and gone for support from aboriginal, landowner, gay, women, animal and environmental rights groups.", "&quot;Taiwan has a strong democracy.", "We can protest, when, where, and how we like, and the activism community has taken advantage of that,&quot; says Pan Han-shen, founder of Green party Taiwan.", "Ma, under pressure from an electorate that saw disturbing similarities between Japan&apos;s Fukushima and Taiwan&apos;s nuclear power industry, vowed to shut down three ageing reactors by 2025.", "In April, he announced that a long-planned proposal to build another petrochemical plant, the $21bn Kuokuang complex on Taiwan&apos;s west coast, would not go ahead after environmentalists complained that it would destroy the island&apos;s largest wetlands, home to the critically endangered Taiwanese pink dolphin.", "Both candidates have promised Taiwan&apos;s aboriginal communities economic and land rights benefits for their support.", "But this election&apos;s going down to the wire and the public&apos;s better understanding of social issues has prompted both candidates to reach out,&quot; says Yeh-lih Wang, chair of political science at National Taiwan University.", "&quot;While this is a new phenomenon in Taiwan, if one of them wins on the back of fringe- element support, future campaign managers will be paying much more attention to activist groups.&quot; With all the promises being made, some members of Taiwan&apos;s activist community are concerned that the winner at the ballot box may eventually renege on pledges."], "title": "Taiwan's voters have the upper hand", "article": "Forget Christmas: if you&apos;re a Taiwanese activist, the best time to open your presents is during a close presidential election race likely to be won on the margins.

But Ma is seeing how useful they can be, come election time,&quot; says DPP spokesman Lin Chun-hsien. &quot;But it isn&apos;t just the votes. A stamp of approval from these groups is highly beneficial for the image of either party or candidate.&quot; Ma has already done substantially more for social causes than his KMT predecessors, who were driven by the need to prop up the economy&apos;s GDP and export growth numbers. In June, he ordered the closure of much of a Formosa Plastics Group petrochemical plant after a series of highly toxic fires broke out. The fires happened after protests against the plant and a report that found that cancer rates in the local community were five times higher than the national average. In April, he announced that a long-planned proposal to build another petrochemical plant, the $21bn Kuokuang complex on Taiwan&apos;s west coast, would not go ahead after environmentalists complained that it would destroy the island&apos;s largest wetlands, home to the critically endangered Taiwanese pink dolphin. &quot;For us, the decision to stop Kuokuang going ahead was one of the biggest in recent years. Before that the DPP was supposedly the environmentalist party. However, President Ma realises that today&apos;s context is very different and we need to strike a balance between social and economic development,&quot; says KMT spokesman Yin Wei. Both candidates have promised Taiwan&apos;s aboriginal communities economic and land rights benefits for their support. Animal protection activists have been told that animal cruelty laws will be strengthened. Women&apos;s groups will have representation quotas raised in political arenas, and gay groups will see anti-discrimination laws improved. Sex workers were acknowledged when a bill was passed legalising the establishment of red-light districts. &quot;Four years ago, Ma came in on a landslide and didn&apos;t need minority or fringe groups to get elected. But this election&apos;s going down to the wire and the public&apos;s better understanding of social issues has prompted both candidates to reach out,&quot; says Yeh-lih Wang, chair of political science at National Taiwan University. &quot;While this is a new phenomenon in Taiwan, if one of them wins on the back of fringe- element support, future campaign managers will be paying much more attention to activist groups.&quot; With all the promises being made, some members of Taiwan&apos;s activist community are concerned that the winner at the ballot box may eventually renege on pledges."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/29/imf-must-heed-g20-decisions", "publicationDate": "2011-11-29T22:59:01Z", "tags": ["Economics", "G20", "World news", "US news", "Nicolas Sarkozy", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)"], "sentences": ["Because of loose monetary policy, low interest rates and a slow recovery in the North Atlantic, accompanied by high interest rates and rapid growth in emerging markets, the world&apos;s investors flocked from north to south \u2013 to Brazil, Chile, South Korea, Taiwan and others."], "title": "The IMF must heed G20 decisions | Kevin Gallagher", "article": "The G20 meeting in Cannes earlier this month was derailed by the pressing eurozone crisis. Actors were disappointed if they were looking for concrete action on global imbalances and the food crisis, let alone the new global monetary system that French President Nicolas Sarkozy boasted would be the goal of the summit when he first took the helm as host. But behind the scenes, the G20 actually delivered on a set of &quot;coherent conclusions&quot; on the management of speculative capital flows in emerging markets that should not be overlooked, especially by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Sarkozy assumed his role as head of the G20 during a period of excessive volatility in global capital markets that continues to this day. Because of loose monetary policy, low interest rates and a slow recovery in the North Atlantic, accompanied by high interest rates and rapid growth in emerging markets, the world&apos;s investors flocked from north to south \u2013 to Brazil, Chile, South Korea, Taiwan and others. More recently, in response to eurozone jitters, capital has retreated from emerging markets to the &quot;safety&quot; of the United States \u2013 showing how dangerous speculative capital flows can be. New work released by the IMF this week suggests they are picking and choosing their direction from the G20. In a significant reversal of past policy, in 2010 the IMF began recommending that nations deploy capital controls to mitigate the effects of speculative capital. Indeed, IMF work in 2010 showed that those countries that deployed capital account regulations were among the least hard-hit during the worst of the global financial crisis. As numerous countries across the globe began using controls in 2010-2011, further IMF work showed that those measures showed signs of working, too. Sarkozy thus called for a code of conduct on capital controls and tasked the IMF to propose a set of guidelines for reform. The IMF delivered a set of guidelines in April of this year that met stiff resistance from the emerging market and developing countries that have been most successful in deploying capital controls. The IMF&apos;s proposed guidelines recommend that countries deploy capital controls only as a last resort \u2013 that is, after such measures as building up reserves, letting currencies appreciate and cutting budget deficits.  Developing countries thought the guidelines missed the point. In the cases where the IMF found controls to be effective, such measures were part of a broader macroeconomic toolkit, and were deployed alongside other measures \u2013 not as a &quot;last resort&quot;. In October, these concerns were echoed by an independent task force of academics and former policy-makers that I co-chaired. We stressed that &quot;consigning such measures to &apos;last resort&apos; status would reduce the available options precisely when countries need as many tools as possible to prevent and mitigate crises.&quot; By the runup to the Cannes meeting, most of the G20&apos;s apparatus was focused on the eurozone. However, a working group was formed to take the capital flows issue to the highest level. Headed by Germany and Brazil, the group forged the &quot;G20 Coherent Conclusions for the Management of Capital Flows Drawing on Country Experiences&quot;. The document was &quot;endorsed by the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in October, then endorsed by the G20 leaders themselves in Cannes. In stark contrast to the IMF guidelines, the G20&apos;s conclusions say that &quot;there is no &apos;one-size fits all&apos; approach or rigid definition of conditions for the use of capital flow management measures&quot;, and that such measures should not be solely seen as a last resort. Instead, the G20 now calls on nations to develop their own country-specific approach to managing capital flows and, as Sarkozy said in his final Cannes speech, &quot;the use of capital controls, and this is very important, is now accepted as a measure of stabilisation.&quot; Throughout the crisis, the IMF has usually been keen to accept new direction from the G20, but there are signs that it may be resisting the new G20 consensus on capital flows. The IMF&apos;s latest report addresses the fact that industrialised country policies trigger unstable capital flows to developing countries and that the rich nations need to design policies that are mindful of such negative &quot;spillovers&quot;. Yet, the IMF merely adds that such principles will be added to their existing guidelines \u2013 seemingly ignoring the fact that those guidelines have now been superseded by the G20&apos;s decisions. The IMF should not ignore the G20&apos;s direction on capital flows. Rather than pushing ahead on a globally enforceable code of conduct that could eventually lead to capital account liberalisation across the globe, the IMF should instead work to reduce the stigma attached to capital controls, protect countries&apos; ability to deploy them, and help nations police investors who evade regulation. G20 finance ministers, central bankers and heads of state have endorsed the use of capital controls by emerging markets, and on their own terms. The IMF should not pick and choose which directions by world leaders it will follow."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/nov/30/inside-guardian-weekly-blogpost", "publicationDate": "2011-11-30T10:39:11Z", "tags": [], "sentences": ["And we also look forward to January&apos;s Taiwanese presidential poll, which looks very tight, and just as  interesting."], "title": "Inside the 2 December edition", "article": "A big week for elections, or a week of big elections?

Tian Tian (&quot;sweetie&quot;) and her male companion Yang Guang (&quot;sunshine&quot;) have just arrived at Edinburgh zoo, thousands of miles from the Wolong panda breeding centre in central China. They are reportedly &quot;jet-lagged but very well&quot;. They&apos;d better be. Soon visitors will flock to the first-class zoo to catch a glimpse of them. The breeding pair, born in 2003, will stay in the Scottish capital for 10 years for research and educational purposes. They will no doubt charm their audience; unlike their cousins in the wild, they are not shy and play in front of people. Pandas&apos; cuddly looks and rarity have won them universal love, which has been well exploited by the Chinese government. In 1972, two pandas were presented to the United States after President Nixon&apos;s historic visit; in 1974, another two were given to Britain in the wake of Edward Heath&apos;s friendly visit. In 2005, as part of the talks with Lien Chan, China gifted two pandas to Taiwan.     'Pandas' cuddly looks have won them universal love.' Photograph: Lijia Zhang    In today&apos;s market economy, however, there are no more freebies. China usually offers 10-year loans with prices close to $1m as the yearly rental. The flocking of would-be panda-huggers will bring fat profits to the zoo and to China. But how will this money be spent? So far, China&apos;s enormous effort in preventing the species from extinction has been focused on its successful breeding programme, primarily through artificial insemination. By the end of 2010, there were some 312 pandas in captivity nationwide. So far, only one captive-born panda, named Xiang Xiang \u2013 &quot;lucky&quot; in Chinese \u2013 has ever been released. I am one of the few people who saw him in the wild before his unlucky ending. In April 2006, Xiang Xiang was set free into a protected mountain region close to Wolong. He had received three years of assertiveness training to equip him with the skills to survive in the wild. Two months later, an ABC TV crew and I walked through dense bamboo forests and examined fresh panda droppings for clues to his whereabouts. Eventually we tracked down the panda, which was fitted with a radio-collar. When Xiang Xiang saw his trainer, he threw himself at him for a bear hug. Mark Horstman, the ABC presenter, questioned Xiang Xiang&apos;s chance of survival if he still craved human contact. Sure enough, in February 2007, Xiang Xiang was found dead, most likely as a result of a fight over territory or over a female panda. So sensitive was the news that the authorities kept quiet about it for more than three months. Which brings us back to Edinburgh zoo, where a group of scientists will research how to introduce captive-born pandas into the wild. Professor Lu Zhi, a panda expert from Beijing University, has said the expensive exercise is as &quot;pointless as taking off the pants in order to fart&quot;, and urged that the money be spent on conservation. She says she doesn&apos;t oppose commercial deals. &quot;Tian Tian and Yang Guang are rather like migrant workers, leaving their village for the city. If the pandas knew how to calculate, they&apos;d agree themselves, to earn lots of money to help to preserve themselves.&quot; But she fears that the profit will go straight to the breeding programmes, which will produce more &quot;un-authentic&quot; pandas. The biggest difference between wild and bred pandas is the very low sex drive of the latter: in the wild, for much longer than human history, the animal has managed to reproduce, without any human assistance, sex videos or any mate-swapping tricks. The long-term solution is to guarantee pandas&apos; natural habitat. While I don&apos;t question our government&apos;s determination to protect the species, it&apos;s worth pointing out that railways and main roads are still being built too close to conservancy areas, or sometimes even through them. There has been little growth of the wild giant panda population, which is now estimated at 2,000. Without a vigorous conservation policy, the pandas will remain an exotic diplomatic tool or money-making tree."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2011/dec/09/android-games-downloads", "publicationDate": "2011-12-09T07:47:18Z", "tags": ["Apps", "Android", "Google", "Eric Schmidt", "Mobile phones", "Smartphones", "Tablet computers", "Technology", "Games", "Culture"], "sentences": ["South Korea tops the list, followed by Hong Kong, Taiwan, the US, Singapore, Sweden, Israel, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway."], "title": "Games take largest share of Android's first 10bn downloads", "article": "Android games have notched up more than 2.5bn downloads since the launch of Google&apos;s Android Market store, taking a 25.6% share of the store&apos;s first 10bn downloads.

Western governments that had hitherto viewed modern networked-communications technology as a useful scourge of authoritarian regimes began to have second thoughts. The U-turn was most painful in the US State Department, where Hillary Clinton had to eat her hat, or at any rate her stirring January 2010 speech about how &quot;information has never been so free&quot; and how &quot;even in authoritarian countries, information networks are helping people discover new facts and making governments more accountable&quot;. Then came the Arab spring and the agreeable discovery that social networking and mobile phones appeared to have politically useful effects. I had a fascinating conversation with a State Department official who related how his colleagues, frustrated by the absence of al-Jazeera on US cable channels, were reduced to streaming it to their laptops. He also told an instructive story about how a senior colleague was baffled when a demonstrator appeared in Tahrir Square holding up a placard that contained only a Twitter hashtag. &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; asked the baffled diplomat. There was delight in the west when the Tunisian regime failed to grasp the significance of Facebook and Twitter, and concern when the Mubarak regime did. There was gleeful exhilaration when some hackers rigged up a &quot;phone to tweet&quot; system that enabled Egyptians to dial an international phone number and record a message that was then broadcast as a tweet. Mubarak shut down Egypt&apos;s internet access for several days, which caused some disquiet. But then the Egyptian generals, who run a lot of businesses, discovered that they were losing millions of dollars in revenue every disconnected day, so the country hastily rejoined the networked world. This lesson \u2013 about the centrality of networked communications to modern industrial life \u2013 did not, however, seem to penetrate the corridors of power in Whitehall. When news of Britain&apos;s outbreak of recreational looting eventually reached the more expensive parts of Tuscany and David Cameron returned to take charge of the government&apos;s response, there was a lot of loose talk about the role that Twitter, Facebook and a particularly sinister technology called BlackBerry Messenger was playing in co-ordinating the mayhem. Men in suits speculated openly about whether these satanic channels should be shut down altogether. Which made one wonder what planet they inhabited. Apart altogether from the irony of seeing a device \u2013 the BlackBerry \u2013 that had once been the ultimate badge of corporate status now apparently metamorphose into a working tool for the scum of the earth, there was the fact that PIN messaging on BlackBerrys is not only an ancient technology, but was one of the reasons why governments across the world wanted BlackBerrys for their officials. The truth is that the heady talk attributing these social and political upheavals to social networking and text messaging was mostly eyewash \u2013 as, for example, the Guardian and LSE&apos;s &quot;Reading the Riots&quot; study of Twitter&apos;s role in the UK looting suggests. Political revolutions are made by people putting themselves in harm&apos;s way \u2013 on the streets. The fact that they use modern communications tools to co-ordinate their activities or to disseminate news is no more remarkable than that the communards of 1871 used cobblestones to build barricades. People use the tools they have to hand. So the prominence of social networking and SMS in political upheaval is simply a measure of the extent to which these technologies have become mundane. THE CLOUD&apos;S THE LIMIT Steve Jobs, its charismatic leader died, yet the iPad maker can do little wrong. How long can it keep it up? I spent a lot of 2011 writing about Apple for the simple reason that it dominated the news. At one stage it even passed Exxon Mobil to become the world&apos;s most valuable corporation. For a company that in 1995 was only months away from collapse this was the culmination of an astonishing comeback. Everywhere one looked, Apple seemed to have the Midas touch. In the mobile phone market, for example, Apple pulled in 40% of smartphone revenues and close to 65% of the sector&apos;s profits. It launched an upgraded version of the iPhone \u2013 the 4S \u2013 that has a voice-control feature that has\u00a0users behaving strangely: instead of talking on their phones, they now talk to them. In the PC market, where it was once a niche player, Apple achieved an all-time record this year \u2013 a 13% share, up 21.5% on the previous year. And then there&apos;s the iPad \u2026 Apple will have sold nearly 50 million before the year is out (up from 14.6 million in 2010). So a device for which there was no obvious need now has a market share of nearly 75%, and in 2015 is predicted it will have a 50% share of a world market that will apparently be 326\u00a0million tablets. In other parts of the Apple forest, the iTunes store sold its 16 billionth song in October sales of apps for the iPhone and iPad grew even more steeply, the company launched a comprehensive cloud service (called \u2013 inevitably \u2013 iCloud) and opened more wildly successful bricks&apos;n&apos;mortar stores. And all of this while the life of its charismatic CEO was ebbing away. This is clearly a company at the top of its game: designing attractive products with high profit margins and bringing them to market with flawless efficiency. Here and there are dark patches that may herald trouble to come: working conditions in the Chinese factories that manufacture the beautiful kit, for example; Apple&apos;s less-than-perfect record at running cloud services; and irritation at the control-freakery that means there&apos;s always a trade-off between users&apos; freedom and Apple&apos;s relentless upgrade policy. Customers who naively upgraded to the latest version of OS X, for example, discovered that their copies of Microsoft Office no longer worked. Apple&apos;s response? Essentially this: tough. Upgrade to the new version of Office. Or use Pages (the Apple word-processing product). BUSINESS CRASH Technology moves at lightning speed. This came as a surprise in 2011 to some tech companies, such as Nokia and Hewlett-Packard  How long can Apple sustain its current dominance? The problem with the technology business is that somewhere else in the jungle there lurks an outfit whose business plan is to eat you for breakfast. And market dominance is no guarantee of safety. Just look at Nokia, which for a generation dominated the mobile phone business and whose flight into the arms of Microsoft marked one of the most humiliating climbdowns in corporate history. The problem was not that Nokia wasn&apos;t selling lots of handsets; it continues to be the world&apos;s biggest manufacturer of phones. It&apos;s just that most of them are low-end, whereas most of the growth (and profit) potential lies in smartphones; ie the market for powerful handheld devices that provide high-quality internet access as well as voice and SMS. This is the market that was comprehensively disrupted by Apple when it launched the iPhone. At the root of Nokia&apos;s decline was the fact that it was, at heart, a hardware company with an engineering culture that didn&apos;t seem to understand software. Smartphones need sophisticated operating systems, and Nokia&apos;s efforts in that direction \u2013 Symbian and MeeGo \u2013 never really measured up. So, in the end, its only option was to team up with Microsoft last February in an &quot;alliance&quot; that would see Windows software running on Nokia hardware. Sales of the first of these devices, the Lumia 800, have been \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 &quot;disappointing&quot; so far. But if Nokia was laid low by its &quot;hard&quot; engineering culture, another technology giant, HP, lost its way by abandoning it. For generations, Hewlett-Packard \u2013 which was named after the two engineers who founded it \u2013 was a byword for wonderfully engineered, highly functional and reliable products, which sold into scientific laboratories, computer centres, offices and retail outlets worldwide. Its LaserJet printers became the de-facto office printer. It was the engineering equivalent of a blue-chip company. But then it embarked on the path of traditional corporate growth by acquiring companies with different cultures, entering the consumer market and in due course becoming dominated at board level by a marketing rather than engineering culture. Since 2006, that board has been enmeshed in one scandal after another \u2013 ranging from allegations of covert surveillance of some board members, cover-ups of technical problems and a legal dispute with Oracle. HP is still a big and important company. But it&apos;s no longer a paragon. And then there was RIM \u2013 the company that makes the BlackBerry smartphone. Once it, too, was a paragon of corporate success as the first company to make a mobile email system that actually worked. As a result it rapidly acquired a stranglehold on corporate and governmental markets. When Apple announced the iPhone it was assumed that, while it might prove disruptive in the consumer market, it would not impact on the BlackBerry franchise in the business world. How wrong can you be? Late last year RIM&apos;s share of the smartphone market was outstripped by the iPhone and soon afterwards RIM was overtaken by Android phones. Since then it&apos;s been downhill all the way, so a company that was worth $84bn (\u00a353bn) in 2008 is now valued at just under $9bn (\u00a35.7bn). Sic transit gloria and all that. FACEBOOK BUBBLE Mark Zuckerberg&apos;s luck (or skill) continued to hold in 2011. Despite the recession, investors clamoured for a chance to invest their dollars There are lies, damn lies and pre-IPO (initial public offering) valuations. Facebook started 2011 with 500 million users and ends it with more than 750 million. If this goes on it&apos;ll have more people than India by this time next year. And its putative value \u2013 ie what it would be worth if it floated on the stock market \u2013 has risen in proportion: from $50bn (\u00a332bn) at the beginning of the year to $100bn (\u00a364bn) now. If anyone doubts that we&apos;re in the middle of a bubble, then this should be a wake-up call. The feeding frenzy to get a share of the Facebook action is driven by many things, but chief among them is the fact that there are a lot of people out there with oodles of cash and nowhere to invest it that will give a decent return now that the banks are bust and even hedge funds have lost their magic. So think of Facebook as a dam behind which a huge tidal wave of cash is building. Of course there are also a lot of people who believe the infant Zuckerberg&apos;s assertions that &quot;everything will be social&quot; one day, and that when that day comes he will be the sole proprietor of the world&apos;s &quot;social graph&quot; (a fancy term for network). So here, in the interests of prudence and common sense, are two cautionary thoughts. The first is that if the eurozone implodes and the world economy nosedives then even ownership of the vaunted social graph might look a tad expensive at $100bn. The second is the salutary fact that of all the recent technology IPOs, only one \u2013 LinkedIn \u2013 is still trading at above its offer price. \u2013 is still trading at above its offer price. START-UP FANTASIES Hopes and investment have been pinned on our silicon economy, but the jobs created may go elsewhere As the UK economy prepared for its next nosedive, the fantasies of coalition ministers about the economic significance of start-ups and &quot;creative industries&quot; became increasingly comical. That&apos;s not to say that start-ups are not wonderful things \u2013 they are \u2013 nor that industries should become uncreative. It&apos;s just that start-ups, especially in the technology sector, create very few jobs in their home countries. They create jobs for the highly skilled people who found and run them, but these are a small elite. Most of the manufacturing jobs go to China or Taiwan. In that sense, while start-ups may have a beneficial impact on exports and GDP, they won&apos;t solve the really scary problem we face \u2013 mass unemployment. Oddly enough, large companies could do something about that. But in order to do so, they&apos;d have to learn to innovate \u2013 and that&apos;s something they have hitherto not been good at. Sigh. BOOKS REWRITTEN A digital version of a classic poem showed the magical potential for ebooks For me, the most exciting product of 2011 was not a gadget or anything Google or Apple did, but an iPad app \u2013 Touch Press&apos;s magical evocation of TS Eliot&apos;s great poem, The Waste Land. By bringing together the text (with scholarly annotations and the marked-up typescript) with a filmed performance by Fiona Shaw, audio recordings of readings by Eliot himself, plus by Alec Guinness, Ted Hughes, Viggo Mortensen and Shaw, and commentaries from Seamus Heaney and others, the app provides an entrancing glimpse of how the book might be reinvented for a digital age.

Gold and silver both lost ground as the dollar became the last remaining safe haven. So Fresnillo fell 187p to \u00a314.94. It was not helped by news that index provider FTSE Group was tightening its rules so that 25% of a company&apos;s shares must be in public hands, up from 15%. The move, which starts for new issues in January, affects Fresnillo as well as Essar Energy, down 13.5p at 193.1p and Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, 36.5p lower at 611p. The companies have 24 months to increase their free float to fit in with the new arrangements. Fresnillo shares were also quoted ex-dividend. Other mining groups were weaker, with Randgold Resources down 410p at \u00a363.60 and African Barrick Gold 37p lower at 443.9p. With continuing doubts about the effectiveness of the measures announced after last week&apos;s EU summit and the planned \u20ac200bn loan to the International Monetary Fund, the FTSE 100 finished 123.35 points lower at 5366.80, a 2.25% decline. Italian bond yields jumped sharply higher and the euro fell to an 11 month low as German chancellor Angela Merkel said there was no quick and easy fix to the problem. Meanwhile, news that the US Federal Reserve planned to keep its powder dry for the moment did not help sentiment, with Wall Street down around 130 points by the time London closed. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said:  Political leaders and central bankers seem to have got stuck in a quagmire of indecision so as a result financial markets gave up on their lack of resolve today. The prospect of the usual Christmas rally has almost completely disappeared as the prospect of a full scale European sovereign debt melt down in the near future became more of a reality.  The FTSE 100 is in the process of recording its fifth ever loss for the month of December since being established as all the festive cheer is being sapped by the continued lack of a lasting [solution] to the European debt crisis.  Only one company in the FTSE 100 was in positive territory. Morrisons edged up 0.8p to 316.9p as the supermarket group announced plans to create 7000 jobs in 2012. Lloyds Banking Group lost 0.65p to 24.065p despite saying Antonio Horta-Osorio, who has been on sick leave, would return as chief executive in January. At the same time Lloyds said it had picked the Co-op as the preferred bidder for the 632 branches it had to put up for sale. Insurer Resolution made some early gains after Barclays said it was an attractive investment. Its founder Clive Cowdery obviously agreed, paying around \u00a3605,000 to buy 240,000 shares at 252.91p each. But with the market under pressure, it closed 1p lower at 250.9p. Among the mid-caps SuperGroup, the retailer behind the Superdry brand, jumped 36p to 538.5p after it unveiled positive trading so far in the weeks leading up to Christmas, but Anglo-Dutch IT services group Logica lost 11.95p to 62.1p. The company warned of tough trading conditions in Europe, and announced 1300 job cuts. Elsewhere Bodycote International dipped 8.6p to 247.3p despite suggestions it could become a bid target. Panmure Gordon analyst Oliver Wynne-James said:  With a diminished following, Bodycote has drifted into deep discount territory and now looks ripe for a transfer to private ownership. The compounded returns for a new owner are sizeable and stand well ahead of those offered by Charter on the eve of its bid approach. With its sector relative hitting a 15 year low, the market chooses not to acknowledge its business model improvements. In our view, the share price already discounts a full double dip and any slowdown in the New Year would be the catalyst for corporate activity. Taking these value propositions on board, we reiterate our buy recommendation with a target price of 440p.  Lower down the market Monitise, which specialises in mobile banking and payment systems, added 2.5p to 29p after saying first half revenues had nearly tripled to \u00a315m. Philip Sparks at Evolution Securities said:  The ramp up in Monitise&apos;s long term contracts with RBS and Visa has pushed up revenue growth. Investment has also increased, with Monitise putting the \u00a324.7m raised from Visa Europe in November to work. Its shares have been weak of late, but as this update shows, that has nothing to do with its operational performance. Today&apos;s statement should bolster confidence that Monitise is turning into a sizeable company.  Aim-listed Acta added 2.75p to 8.625p after it signed a deal with Taiwan&apos;s Asia Pacific Fuel Cell Technologies. The two companies will develop refuelling stations for scooters and light vehicles that run on hydrogen. Finally Real Good Food, one of the Guardian&apos;s share tips of the year, rose 1.5p to 36.25p after an upbeat trading statement. The company, which distributes sugar and makes bakery products for the likes of Waitrose, said trading had continued to improve since July, and its borrowings had been cut. Analyst Phil Carroll at the company&apos;s broker Shore Capital said:  [Real Good Food] looks to be an undemanding valuation and an attractive investment opportunity.

Try K-pop", "article": "The biggest surprise at last month&apos;s MTV European Music awards didn&apos;t come from the outfits chosen Lady Gaga, or that weird naked man roaming around the stage. In fact, the most unexpected moment arrived towards the end of the ceremony, when the winner of best worldwide act award was announced. The\u00a0winners of the fan-driven award were Korean group Bigbang, who won 58m votes to beat Britney Spears. This was the one act that night most viewers wouldn&apos;t have known. Bigbang&apos;s victory shed light on the rise and rise of Korean music across Europe. Korean pop \u2013 K-pop for short \u2013 has become one of South Korea&apos;s most notable exports in recent years. Paul Han, co-founder of the\u00a0South Korean pop culture blog Allkpop.com, defines the style as &quot;fun music, with\u00a0a fusion of many genres&quot; \u2013 it takes in electro-driven bubblegum pop;\u00a0sometimes it&apos;s sprinkled with semi-nonsense English lyrics; sometimes there&apos;s an added R&amp;B sway. Its audience is largely female, from early teens through to late 20s. &quot;K-pop, I think, is personality,&quot; says the Korean-Canadian singer G.Na. &quot;It&apos;s very melodious, very easy to sing along to.&quot; Since Allkpop.com launched in 2007, Han has seen a consistent growth in its European readership, reflecting K-pop&apos;s spread from its homeland. &quot;When we first opened our blog, the Europeans made up maybe 1% of the readers,&quot; he says. &quot;Now it&apos;s close to 25%.&quot; That spread has been noticed by the big corporations: iTunes started selling K-pop to European audiences early in 2010, and Google is planning to set up up a K-pop channel. This past year has already seen several major K-pop events in the west, with the SMTown World Tour \u2013 featuring Super Junior, TVXQ and Girls&apos; Generation \u2013 selling thousands of tickets for shows in Paris, Los Angeles and New York. SHINee played the UK&apos;s first ever K-pop show at the opening of the London Korean film festival earlier this autumn, and at the start of this month the Brixton Academy in London hosted the United Cube Concert, with a bill made up of acts on the Korean label Cube Entertainment, with fans paying up to \u00a365 a ticket. The spread of Korean pop culture \u2013 a phenomenon nicknamed hallyu, or Korean wave \u2013 has been driven by TV, but not by the reality shows that are breeding grounds for UK manufactured pop. Instead, drama has been the vehicle to bring K-pop to new audiences. The process started with What Is Love All About, which was shown on Chinese state TV in 1997, and which sparked a wider interest in Korean TV and music across east Asia. At the same time, the Korean boy band H.O.T. (which stands for High-five of Teenagers) found a big audience across the region with hits We Are the Future, Candy and Warrior&apos;s Descent. They had been put together by the SM Entertainment company in 1996, and their success \u2013 they even had their own brand of soft drink at their peak \u2013 provided a template for future K-pop bands. Their international success was followed by BoA \u2013 the female artist Kwan Boa, whose stage name stands for Beat of Angel \u2013 who sold 1m copies of her Listen to My Heart single in Japan in 2001. The big breakthrough, though, came with the show Winter Sonata in 2003, which was shown in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines. With the rise of YouTube, subsequent dramas were able to spread further in a second Korean wave \u2013 Boys Over Flowers, launched in 2008, now has dedicated viewers around the world, both through the web \u2013 with fans uploading and subtitling episodes \u2013 and on TV stations as far afield as Kazakhstan and Peru. As Jae Kim of the Korean TV network MBC explains: &quot;Before\u00a0the internet, many fans had very little access to K-pop. You only would really have access by visiting Korea. The internet created accessibility.&quot; Now countless fan sites draw attention to every piece of\u00a0news, now matter how minute, from Korean TV and music. K-pop has benefited from the rise of these dramas, because music is a key part of these shows. SHINee&apos;s Stand By Me, for example, featured heavily in Boys Over Flowers. Key songs are repeated in Korean dramas, giving them exposure every bit as potent as a video in heavy rotation. When SHINee played in London, for example, though Stand By Me was not included on their setlist, it was repeatedly played through the PA to deafening cheers from fans who&apos;d travelled from across the UK and Europe to see the band. Those fans in Leicester Square testify to the power of the TV dramas in drawing them into the music, and to the fan-driven nature of its spread: &quot;A lot of my friends were watching [the show] You&apos;re Beautiful, and suggested that I watch it and listen to [the group] F.T. Island, and it just started from there,&quot; says 17-year-old Londoner Jessica. The result, according to a survey conducted by the Korean Culture and Information Service, is that there are an estimated 460,000 Korean-wave fans across Europe, concentrated in Britain and France, with 182 hallyu fan clubs worldwide boasting a total of 3.3m members. The Korean Connection, based in Paris, is a hallyu fan club with 4,000 members, established with the backing of the state-run Korean Cultural Centre, which arranges K-pop club nights, dance classes, and trips to Korea, and spreads the word about K-pop through social networking sites. Maxime Paquet, its president, sees K-pop&apos;s strength as being its refusal to stand still. The average K-pop event, he says, is &quot;close to what we can call &apos;total entertainment&apos; \u2026 K-pop is not only music, but a complete show. K-pop groups are managed by smart entertainment companies that invest a lot in artistic innovation. Every month, new groups appear and disappear.&quot; K-pop&apos;s fans use the internet as if they were a campaigning group. When the SMTown tour&apos;s sole Paris date sold out in minutes this summer, fans organised a flash mob in front of the Louvre to demand a second date be added, with Facebook and Tumblr communities adding their voices to the mix. Freya Bigg, who runs the UK-based blog UnitedKpop.com, helped organise similar flashmobs in London&apos;s Trafalgar Square to demand shows from her preferred K-pop acts. &quot;They&apos;re a great way to get the attention of the Korean media \u2013 it shows the dedication of fans here in the UK. They&apos;re also a great way to connect fans and find more \u2013 imagine thinking that you&apos;re the only fan around and then you see a flashmob in town.&quot; The level of hysteria now the K-pop acts are finally coming to London is comparable to any X Factor live show. &quot;United Cube London means so much to me,&quot; exclaims a breathless Li Suhaimi, from east London, who says she&apos;s followed the band Beast \u2013 on the Brixton bill \u2013 &quot;through several time zones. I&apos;ve travelled to Seoul, Thailand and Singapore to see them.&quot; So, how does K-pop grow in the West from here? Can it make the transition from being an internet-based phenomenon, with a self-selecting if hugely active fanbase, to crossing over into the mainstream media? Was BigBang&apos;s win at the European Music awards the shape of things to come, or just an indication of how well-organised those fans are \u2013 in short, was it K-pop&apos;s Belle and Sebastian at the Brits moment? Simon Hong, the CEO of Cube Entertainment, the label whose bands came to London a couple of weeks ago, is optimistic but cautious: &quot;The show in Brixton is a good opportunity for this part of the world to get a glimpse of our high-level artists in Korea. But there&apos;s a lot more work to be done, so K-pop is just on the starting line.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/16/apple-a5-chip-made-by-samsung", "publicationDate": "2011-12-16T08:01:17Z", "tags": ["Apple", "Samsung", "Technology", "iPad", "iPhone", "Computing", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Tablet computers", "Manufacturing sector", "Business", "Technology sector"], "sentences": ["Apple relies on its main contract manufacturer for gadgets, Foxconn, to assemble them, mainly in its factories in China and Taiwan."], "title": "Apple's A5 chip is built by Samsung \u200e", "article": "While Apple and Samsung battle it out in the courts over the design of the iPad compared to the Galaxy Tab, and vie for top spot in the smartphone market, the US company is relying on its rival for the essential processor in its tablet. The A5 processor \u2013 used in the iPhone 4S and iPad 2 \u2013 is now made in a sprawling factory in Austin, Texas, which is owned by Korean electronics giant Samsung, according to people familiar with the operation. One of the few major components to be sourced from within the US, the A5 processor is built by Samsung in a newly constructed $3.6bn non-memory chip production line that reached full production in early December. Nearly all of the output of the non-memory chip production from the factory is dedicated to producing Apple chips, one of the people said. Samsung also produces NAND flash memory chips in Austin. The South Korean giant began supplying the A5 processors to Apple from the Austin plant this year, the people said. Apple declined to comment, saying it does not detail supplier relationships. A Samsung spokeswoman declined to comment on its customers and the specification of the chips made in its Austin plant, but said the company expanded the factory to include a production line to make logic chips. The A5 is one such chip. The powerful A5 processor, which uses technology licensed from Britain&apos;s ARM Holdings, is designed by Apple in California, by a team formerly part of PA Semi \u2013 an American chip design company that Apple bought in April 2008. The A5 chip debuted in Apple&apos;s iPad 2 in March and now also powers the new iPhone 4S. The chip is twice as fast as its predecessor, the A4, which is also made by Samsung, according to reports from teardown firms that have taken Apple&apos;s devices apart. Apart from Austin, Samsung has only one other non-memory logic chip factory, in South Korea. Apple relies on its main contract manufacturer for gadgets, Foxconn, to assemble them, mainly in its factories in China and Taiwan. Semiconductor companies are attracted to Austin because of a steady supply of educated employees from the University of Texas&apos; engineering school. Also based in Austin are Freescale Semiconductor and other chip companies such as ARM, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Samsung has added about 1,100 jobs to support the new non-memory chip production in the factory, which produces 40,000 silicon wafers every month, a Samsung spokeswoman said. The rest of the 2,400 employees in Samsung&apos;s Austin location work in its NAND flash memory factory by the logic chip factory, she said. The Korean company, which began the US plant in 1996 to make its NAND flash memory chips, continues to produce them there alongside the A5. Samsung&apos;s factory is the largest foreign investment in Texas with a total investment of about $9bn, according to the Austin Chamber of Commerce. Austin is also home to an Apple customer call centre that deals with customer complaints in North America, Apple&apos;s biggest market. The Cupertino company employs thousands in that facility, who deal with calls ranging from complaints to support."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/dec/21/ethiopia-boost-farming-agriculture-invest", "publicationDate": "2011-12-21T15:18:09Z", "tags": ["Food security", "Ethiopia", "Global development", "Africa", "World news", "Farming"], "sentences": ["The review looked at other countries, such as Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea and Chile, that had successfully transformed agriculture, and found that a common denominator was an institution that drove change."], "title": "Ethiopia invests in farmers to achieve country's middle-income ambitions | Mark Tran", "article": "Fields of red sorghum in terraced fields that stretch into the distance are a common sight in the scenic mountains of eastern Ethiopia, giving a misleading impression of bountiful harvests despite this year&apos;s drought in the east Africa. Farmers tie five or more tall sorghum stalks together so they support one another, and the red seeds at the top of the plant grow heavier as the plants ripen, giving them a triffid-like appearance. A common plant and an important staple crop for millions of poor Ethiopians, sorghum is ubiquitous in the region around Dire Dawa, 352km north-east of Addis Ababa, the capital. Apple orchards are a more surprising presence. Dadi Yadete, a bearded 72-year-old, took a gamble three years ago and started growing apples, a fruit that he didn&apos;t know. Hesitant and doubtful initially, he planted 12 trees, but the experiment has paid off. Located 2,300 metres above sea level, these Ethiopian highlands enjoy a temperate climate, almost alpine, where apples can thrive. Yadete, who has two wives and nine children, now has 70 flourishing apple trees on his small plot of land \u2013 about 0.5 hectares \u2013 where he also has a large avocado tree. He also grows barley, a few coffee bushes, sweet potato, green pepper and bright red hot chillies. &quot;Life was very difficult when I was trying to grow maize and barley,&quot; said Yadete. &quot;I was producing nothing and I was receiving food aid, now I don&apos;t need food aid.&quot; He gets about $600 a year from the sale of his apples, and he owns four cows and two oxen, which makes him a relatively wealthy man. One cow and one ox count as wealth in Ethiopia, which ranked 174 out of 187 countries in the 2011 human development index. Ethiopia is to receive \u00a3331m ($521m) in British aid a year until 2015, making it one of the biggest beneficiaries of UK development money. Growth has been impressive in recent years, although its human rights record is frequently criticised. Others in Yadete&apos;s village of Thefebanti, which has about 200 households (five people to a household on average) are also prospering through the sale of apples, as well as the production of seedlings. A few steps away from Yadete&apos;s plot, a group of women are packing little pots with soil and compost as the village also has a tree nursery. There are rows of tree seedlings, including prodocarpus \u2013 good for timber \u2013 and hagenia and juniper. The village is doing well, despite initial impressions of extreme poverty. A bumpy unpaved road runs past homes made from mud and wattle with corrugated iron roofs, but a regular market in the village and proximity to the main road give it an advantage over remote villages higher in the mountains. Yadete and his fellow villagers are the beneficiaries of Meret (from the Amharic word for land), a joint venture between the UN&apos;s World Food Programme and the Ethiopian government. A response to the food crises of the 1970s, Meret targets chronically food insecure communities with the WFP providing food for those involved \u2013 3kg of cereal every work day \u2013 to each participant for three months. Meret also provides technical advice for farmers to reforest barren hillsides, and build or refurbish terraces. The key is to win the commitment and trust of the villagers. In contrast to the top-down approach of the notorious Derg \u2013 the Mengistu regime that ruled from 1972 to 1991 \u2013 Meret workers discuss with farmers their problems and the steps they need to take. In the case of Yadete and his fellow farmers, agreement was reached to close off the top of the mountain slopes above the village to farming and grazing for two years. Trees were planted, terraces built or repaired, and the slopes dotted with mini water barriers made of stone and earth in the shape of a v (herrings), or semi-circles (eyebrows) that help to retain water and to heal the land. About 45% of Ethiopia&apos;s land is above 1,500m, with mountainous terrain, plateaux, steep slopes and deep valleys. Despite extensive groundwater resources, 90% of agriculture depends on rainfall rather than irrigation. Rains, which tend to occur in bursts concentrated in three to four months of the year, has grown more erratic in recent years, which has been attributed to climate change. Because of population pressure \u2013 at 79 million, Ethiopia is Africa&apos;s second most populous nation, after Nigeria \u2013 much of the land in the highlands has been overfarmed, and trees have been cut down, allowing rainwater to flow downhill instead of being retained. In parts of this region, the terraces look bone dry and the sorghum stunted. The Dire Dawa sub-office covers 59 Meret sites in 13 districts, a total of 35,500 households, taking in 175,000 people who benefited directly from the programme this year. The sites cover 53,866 hectares but, as Meret officials point out, it is a drop in the ocean, despite a big push on agriculture. Agricultural transformation Ethiopia is devoting 17% of its budget to farming, well above the 10% commitment agreed by African governments. In its ambitious growth and transformation plan, Ethiopia has set an overall target of at least 8.1% growth in agriculture between 2011 and 2015 as part of its goal to reach middle-income status by 2025. It calls for more than doubling the production of key crops from 18.1m to 39.5m tonnes. Agriculture is key for Ethiopia, accounting for 45% of economic output and employing about 80% of the population. Despite its dependence on rainwater, agricultural experts see no reason why the country cannot be Africa&apos;s breadbasket if it realises its agricultural potential. &quot;As long as you can control the water, you can grow whatever you want,&quot; said a private investor, who is leasing land for dairy cows. In 2008, the prime minister, Meles Zenawi, commissioned the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation to write a review of agriculture to see why the country was not getting a bigger bang for its birr. The review concluded that despite significant investment, there was a lack of co-ordination among government agencies and a lack of skilled staff to implement largescale initiatives. The review looked at other countries, such as Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea and Chile, that had successfully transformed agriculture, and found that a common denominator was an institution that drove change. Meles liked the review, and decided to set up the Agricultural Transformation Agency. Unusually, he appointed someone from the Ethiopian diaspora \u2013 Khalid Bomba, 45, a former investment banker at JP Morgan \u2013 to lead it. The ATA office in Addis, which opened in August, fizzes with the energy of a start-up as young, eager staff bustle about in stark contrast to the sleepy atmosphere over at the ministry of agriculture. Bomba explains that the ATA&apos;s job will be to identify bottlenecks in the system and try to come up with solutions, and to co-ordinate the activities of key players from the agriculture ministry to the country&apos;s four biggest regions. Bomba gives an example of the kind of hurdles he faces in the planting of tef, a cereal used to make Ethiopia&apos;s spongy flatbread staple, injera. &quot;We have carried out promising tests that show farmers can grow more by using less seeds and planting in rows instead of a scatter approach,&quot; said Bomba. &quot;It&apos;s counter-intuitive, but the yield is higher by sowing 5kg of tef instead of 25kg-30kg per hectare. The problem is that we don&apos;t have the people to train the agricultural extension workers to spread the message to the farmers.&quot; The jury is out on the ATA, although Bomba has Meles&apos;s ear, which counts for much in what one development official described as the world&apos;s last Albanian-type Marxist state. As long as Meles is around, other ministers will have to pay attention to the ATA, which is overseen by a board chaired by the prime minister himself. Bomba sees himself staying in the job for three to five years to train Ethiopian officials to take over and run the agency themselves. The plan is for the agency to phase itself out in 15 years&apos; time. While Bomba and others in Addis grapple with policy issues, Yadete is doing his bit for Ethiopian agriculture by growing his apples. Despite his successful adoption of a fruit that he had never tasted until three years ago, Yadete and his wife hardly eat their apples, which he describes as tasting like bananas. &quot;I don&apos;t eat the apples,&quot; he says, &quot;Whenever I see them, I see money.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/dec/25/guardian-sport-quiz-of-the-year", "publicationDate": "2011-12-25T13:48:28Z", "tags": ["Sport", "Football"], "sentences": ["Claim to fame: match the name to their fleeting moment of fame in 2011 Those names in the frame: Jace Lankow, Sian Massey, Brandon Kelly, Mr Bai, Kelsi Reach, Husam Wadi, Ben Edwards, Tiziano Crudeli, Conor Niland, Alain Rolland 1 Threw a hot dog at Tiger Woods during the Frys.com Open 2 Was appointed Martin Brundle&apos;s successor as BBC F1 commentator in 2012 3 Sent off Wales&apos;s Sam Warburton in Rugby World Cup semi-final 4 Became the first Irishman to qualify for Wimbledon since 1984 5 Italian football pundit achieved international fame by impersonating Kevin-Prince Boateng&apos;s title-winning Moonwalk \u2013 badly 6 Sparked a brawl at the college football game between UCLA Bruins and Arizona Wildcats by running on to field dressed as an official 7 Became first Palestinian ever to score in a World Cup qualifier on home soil against Afghanistan 8 Achieved huge YouTube fame after dropping his daughter to try to catch a ball during a baseball game in Taiwan 9 Dallas Cowboys cheerleader hugged by her boyfriend, Buffalo Bills receiver David Nelson, live on TV after he scored against her team 10 Official mocked by Andy Gray and Richard Keys \u2013 kicking off the saga that led to the pundits&apos; leaving Sky Picture round Click here to see the picture round gallery Click here for the answers"], "title": "Guardian Sport quiz of the year", "article": "Round one: football 1 Where was Kenny Dalglish when he was asked to take over Liverpool? 2 Which former Manchester United striker won his club&apos;s first-ever league title in his first season in charge? 3 Which team won the inaugural women&apos;s Super League season? 4 The ownership issues of which player threatened QPR&apos;s promotion to the Premier League? 5 Which Premier League manager was robbed on his way to the Madrid derby in January? 6 How many league titles had Gary Neville won with Manchester United when he retired in February? 7 Who won the Europa League? 8 Which League Two manager was sacked after paying for the club&apos;s heating bills out of his own pocket? 9 Who scored Birmingham&apos;s two goals in the Carling Cup final win over Arsenal? 10 Who was banned for two matches after poking Barcelona&apos;s assistant coach Tito Vilanova in the eye?

But while exports from Scotland have broken records in 2011 (the equivalent of 570m bottles waved a tearful farewell at the docks in the first half of the year alone and there&apos;s even been talk of a possible shortage as a result) the industry can&apos;t afford to be complacent.  While there&apos;s plenty of financial motivation for unscrupulous distillers to attempt to pass off substandard spirits as scotch, it&apos;s the whiskies produced around the world in the style of scotch, yet which don&apos;t claim to be scotch, that ought to keep the industry on its toes. Well, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and there&apos;s a whole cadre of carefully crafted drams from the furthest reaches of Asia to Scotland&apos;s very doorstep that are only too happy to trumpet their true origins. The co-writer of the excellent Whisky for Everyone website Matt Chambers kindly agreed to meet me at The Albannach whisky bar on Trafalgar Square for a taste tour of the whisky distilling world to see how these interlopers match up. Japan     Yamazaki distillery Suntory 12 year old whisky from Japan.    The Japanese have a long tradition of enjoying and emulating scotch whisky, and for this reason it was to Osaka that we first ventured. The Yamazaki distillery was founded in 1923 by Shinjiro Torii, following an exhaustive 5 year mission to Scotland to study all facets of whisky-making on the part of his collaborator Masataka Taketsuru. The stills were manufactured in Scotland and shipped out and imported peat lends flavour. The result, in the Suntory 12 year old is a honey-coloured whisky that mimics, even mirrors a fine single malt scotch. I&apos;ve tasted a few whiskies in my time and reckon this would take me in if someone handed me a glass and said it was scotch. India     Amrut distillery Fusion whisky from India.    Next we sampled Amrut&apos;s Fusion single malt, an Indian whisky distilled in Bangalore from a mix of Scottish and Indian barley. The desire to echo scotch in the ingredients is repeated in the both the name of the distillery (as &quot;whisky&quot; comes from the Gaelic &quot;uisge beatha&quot; meaning &quot;water of life&quot;, so &quot;amrut&quot; in Hindi refers to &quot;eternal life&quot;) and its location 3,000 feet above sea level in an area of India held to resemble the Scottish climate. Temperatures as reliably cool as those which grace Scotland are not common here, however, and the speed at which the raw spirit matures (and evaporates through the wooden walls of the barrels) is consequently much greater. This means whiskies are declared finished and bottled after only a few years in the cask and age statements are eschewed. The results don&apos;t appear to suffer unduly for their lack of age - the distillery has been in operation since 1948 and the Fusion doesn&apos;t look or taste like a young spirit. Bottled at 50% abv it&apos;s heady with an attractive amber colour, plenty of grainy flavour and some peat. Taiwan     Kavalan whisky from Taiwan.    Compared with the venerable distilleries of Japan and India the Taiwanese are relative newcomers to whisky production, with a matching youthful zest and enthusiasm. Using equipment made in Scotland the Kavalan distillery was built in just 8 months of 2006 and produces some 6m litres of whisky a year. As in Bangalore the ambient temperature makes for rapid maturation, and given its age bottle we tried had staggering depth of fruity flavours edging towards dark chocolate, and an incredible gem-like amber colour.  This one was really surprising - the thought that only 5 years of distilling and 2 of maturation can produce results like this presents a challenge to the idea that whisky in the scotch style has to be old. Unfortunately for buyers in the UK Kavalan, like many top quality international whiskies, outside its native country it&apos;s only really to be found in airport duty free shops (it&apos;s certainly not yet available duty-paid in the UK).  Netherlands     Zuidam distillery Millstone whisky from the Netherlands.    If the Netherlands doesn&apos;t leap into your mind as a top-flight whisky-producing nation then you&apos;re not alone, but Fred and Patrick van Zuidam started making eau de vie in the late 1970s and have been distilling whisky since 1998. They pride themselves on their small-batch, artisanal approach and only bottle about 20,000 litres each year. The Millstone we tried has a delicate colour and is long on grain flavours followed by herby, slightly medicinal fennel notes. Wales     Penderyn Welsh Gold whisky from Wales.    Closer to the inner sanctum of scotch is Penderyn distillery in the Brecon Beacons to the north of Cardiff. Using an innovative Faraday still (which works like this. What could be more straightforward?) the distillery has been producing whisky since 2000. In the cool Welsh climate these spirits are now coming of age; the single malt Welsh Gold is finished in Madeira casks which add a note of sweetness to the grainy nose and grassy flavour, and there&apos;s a sherry cask finish too which pits the grain against dried fruit. Their peated expression was the pick of the bunch for me; rather than using peated barley the whisky is finished in old Islay casks and has flavours of stinging nettles, capsicum and Greek honey. England     The English Whisky Co.'s Chapter 9 whisky. From England.    The appropriately named English Whisky Company is the first in over a century. Distillation began in 2006 under the eye of Iain Henderson, a former Laphroaig man who was persuaded to help set things in motion. They call each fresh experiment in whisky-making a &quot;chapter&quot;, which makes for extra interest as the history of the project is laid out for all to taste. The Chapter 6 we tried was grassy, grainy and fresh; the peated Chapter 9 much more complex with sausagey, barbecuey notes and a honeyed sweetness in the mouth. What makes an end of year dram for you? Will you go for an old familiar favourite or might you take the opportunity to try something new?"}]}
