The thieves use dynamite and even bulldozers to break into the deepest chambers \u2013 and night vision goggles and oxygen canisters to search them. The artefacts they take are often sold on within days to international dealers. Police have already stepped up their campaign against the criminals and the government is devoting extra resources to protecting sites and tracing offenders. This year it set up a national information centre to tackle such crimes. Tomb theft is a global problem that has gone on for centuries. But the sheer scope of China&apos;s heritage \u2013 with thousands of sites, many of them in remote locations \u2013 poses a particular challenge. &quot;Before, China had a large number of valuable ancient tombs and although it was really depressing to see a tomb raided, it was still possible to run into a similar one in the future,&quot; said Professor Wei Zheng, an archaeologist at Peking University. &quot;Nowadays too many have been destroyed. Once one is raided, it is really difficult to find a similar one.&quot; His colleague, Professor Lei Xingshan, said: &quot;We used to say nine out of 10 tombs were empty because of tomb-raiding, but now it has become 9.5 out of 10.&quot; Their team found more than 900 tombs in one part of Shanxi they researched and almost every one had been raided. They spent two years excavating two high grade tombs from the Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou periods (jointly spanning 1100BC to 221BC) and found both had been completely emptied by thieves. &quot;It really is devastating to see it happening,&quot; Zheng said. &quot;Archaeologists are now simply chasing after tomb raiders.&quot; Experts say the problem became worse as China&apos;s economy opened up, with domestic and international collectors creating a huge market for thieves. Zheng said a phrase emerged in the 1980s: &quot;If you want to be rich, dig up old tombs and become a millionaire overnight.&quot; But he added that a crackdown by authorities was helping to contain the problem to an extent. According to the ministry of public security, police investigated 451 tomb-raiding cases in 2010 and another 387 involving the theft of relics. In the first six months of that year, they smashed 71 gangs, detained 787 suspects and recovered 2,366 artefacts. Those caught face fines and jail terms of three to 10 years, or life in the most serious cases. Officials say tomb thefts have become increasingly professionalised. Gangs from the provinces worst hit \u2013 Shanxi, Shaanxi and Henan, which all have a particularly rich archaeological heritage \u2013 have begun exporting their expertise to other regions. One researcher estimated that 100,000 people were involved in the trade nationally. Wei Yongshun, a senior investigator, told China Daily in 2011 that crime bosses often hired experienced teams of tomb thieves and sold the plunder on to middlemen as quickly as they could. Other officers told how thieves paid farmers to show them the tombs and help them hide from police. Local officials have insufficient resources to prevent the crimes and often do not see the thefts as a priority. Others turn a blind eye after being bribed by gangs. Often, raiders return to a site repeatedly over months. In some cases, thieves have reportedly built small &quot;factories&quot; next to tombs \u2013 allowing them to break in without being noticed. But international collectors bear as much responsibility for the crimes as the actual thieves: the high prices they offer create the incentive for criminals. Wei said: &quot;Stolen cultural artefacts are usually first smuggled out through Hong Kong and Macao and then taken to Taiwan, Canada, America or European countries to be traded.&quot; The sheer size as well as value of the relics demonstrates the audacity of the raiders \u2013 last year, the Chinese authorities recovered a 27-tonne sarcophagus that had been stolen from Xi&apos;an and shipped to the US. It took four years of searching before China identified the collector who had bought the piece \u2013 from the tomb of Tang dynasty concubine Wu Huifei \u2013 for an estimated $1m (\u00a3650,000), and secured its return. Luo Xizhe of the Shaanxi provincial cultural relics bureau told China Daily: &quot;If we don&apos;t take immediate and effective steps to protect these artefacts, there will be none of these things left to protect in 10 years.&quot; He said provincial and national authorities planned to spend more than 100m yuan (\u00a310m) on surveillance equipment for tombs in Shaanxi over the next five years. But video surveillance and infrared imaging devices for night-time monitoring cost 5m yuan for even a small grave, he added. Spending on protecting cultural relics as a whole soared from 765m yuan in 2006 to 9.7bn in 2011. Wei, the archaeologist, said precious evidence such as how and when the tomb was built was often destroyed in raids, even if relics could be recovered. &quot;Quite apart from the valuable objects lost, the site is also damaged and its academic value is diminished,&quot; he said. In a particularly alarming case last year, raiders simply bulldozed their way through 10 newly discovered tombs in eastern Jiangxi province. The Global Times newspaper reported that pieces of coffins and pottery and iron items were scattered across the ravaged site, which was thought to date back 2,000 years. Archaeologists said further excavation was impossible because the destruction was so bad.

But McCourt raised his forecast for the number of iPhones sold from 27m to 29m, and calculates that Apple will report revenues of $37.9bn (\u00a324.2bn), its biggest ever \u2013 although that is a slight reduction on his previous forecast of $38.1bn. Meanwhile, the electronics giant Samsung may have sold as many as 35m smartphones in the quarter, a record for the sector. The company is expected to report its guidance for the quarter on Friday, ahead of its detailed figures later in January. In a new note on Apple issued on Tuesday, McCourt said he was lowering his estimate for iPad sales after seeing data from Amazon which suggested it could have sold between 4m and 5m of its Kindle Fire tablet, &quot;which probably means maybe 1-2m cannibalised iPad sales at most&quot;. While the forecast iPhone figures would make it Apple&apos;s best-ever quarter for its smartphones, they would lag behind Samsung&apos;s by a substantial amount. The smartphone and tablet business is now Samsung&apos;s most profitable. McCourt said that he had also lowered his estimate for the number of Macintosh computers sold slightly, from 4.9m to 4.8m. That would however still represent a 17.7% increase on last year while the rest of the PC market is forecast to have seen near-zero growth as a number of companies struggled with hard disk inventory shortages caused by floods in  Taiwan  Thailand.

We expect iPhone 5 in [autumn] 2012 to be a significant revenue and earnings growth driver, and a potential Apple TV as upside to our model if it comes to fruition this year. &quot;We do expect Y/Y [year-on-year] growth to be somewhat more challenging in March/June for Apple due to tough comparisons from fiscal 2011.&quot; Corrected: the floods affecting hard drive manufacture were in Thailand, not Taiwan."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2012/jan/05/ai-weiwei-yayoi-kusama-inside-out", "publicationDate": "2012-01-05T11:20:00Z", "tags": ["Ai Weiwei", "Art and design", "Art", "Installation", "Yayoi Kusama"], "sentences": ["At the end of November, a huge show called Absent opened in Taiwan."], "title": "Ai Weiwei, Yayoi Kusama, Inside Out: three life-enhancing projects for 2012", "article": "Since I came back to work on Tuesday, reports of three projects have cheered up the dark days of early January. The first is regarding Ai Weiwei, undoubtedly the most significant artist of 2011. At the end of November, a huge show called Absent opened in Taiwan. Forever Bicycles, consisting of 1,200 bicycles, is the most recent installation, which writer James Gaddy puts in the tradition of work with bicycle wheels by Duchamp and Picasso. Is it bad that my first thought was of this Katie Melua song? Sunflower Seeds also opens in New York at the weekend. Sadly, the health and safety issues that made the installation out of bounds at Tate Modern haven&apos;t gone away, so New Yorkers won&apos;t be able to walk over them. I feel quite privileged that I managed to do this on the opening night, when it was still possible. Here&apos;s what it sounded like.

Rarely meriting a mention is the primary hub of Mandarin pop, Taiwan. This island state shares a language with mainland China but is free from the weight of its political control and has a cultural influence vastly disproportionate to its size. Domestic audiences in Taiwan are unafraid to embrace all things &quot;sentimental&quot;, a term of criticism elsewhere in the world, and so Chinese-language chart music is often perceived by outsiders as lacking the dynamism of the best acts from Seoul and Tokyo. Slow jams and gentle serenades rule the airwaves. But a new generation of Taiwanese stars drawing on US R&amp;B is significantly increasing Mandopop&apos;s crossover potential. On paper, a collaboration between a former telemarketer who describes himself as &quot;Christ&apos;s servant first, entertainer second&quot; and Ryan Tedder, lead singer of OneRepublic, may not sound a particularly appealing prospect. However, those able to extend the benefit of the doubt to California-born Van Ness Wu&apos;s Is This All will be rewarded with one of the most effective pop ballads of the year. Tedder, who produces hits for big-name US stars when not serving as America&apos;s least charismatic frontman, has spent a career attempting to combine the intimate and grandiose. With its rousing strings and Wu&apos;s impassioned delivery, the single pulls it off with more aplomb than anything he has been involved in since Beyonc\u00e9&apos;s Halo. Within the Sinosphere, Wu still has some way to go to match the popularity of compatriot Leehom Wang. Better known in the west for his role in Ang Lee&apos;s Lust Caution, the New York-born singer and actor is famous for a style he describes as &quot;chinked out&quot; \u2013 fusing elements of traditional Chinese and Taiwanese music with contemporary urban pop and reclaiming a racial slur along the way. Recent single Huo Li Quan Kai (Open Fire) contents itself with blending Michael Jackson and Ke$ha but lyrics about cultural imperialism and prejudice maintain the patriotic theme.            Wu and Wang may have closer family ties to the US but the Taiwanese star who has made the biggest impression overseas remains Jay Chou. His concerts at venues such as the MGM Grand in Las Vegas may appeal primarily to the Chinese and Taiwanese diaspora, but his recent turn as Kato in Hollywood blockbuster The Green Hornet and an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel have broadened his name recognition. With 30m legitimate albums sold in a section of Asia where the vast majority of CDs bought are unregistered pirate copies, there&apos;s little need for him to worry about running out of fans at home either. Eleventh album Exclamation Mark is at its best when playing with Timberlake-style dance pop, as on the nimble Shadow Puppetry. Taiwan may not be able to claim any girl groups on a par with Seoul&apos;s extraordinary 2NE1 or After School but, in Lollipop F, it has a contender for one of the wider region&apos;s most exciting boybands. Dance, the quartet&apos;s first single since returning from a stint on Korean television, borrows K-Pop&apos;s maximalist approach to bludgeoning effect. The video, which features lasers, luminescent robots and neon Hammer pants, would almost be enough to induce sensory overload even if it wasn&apos;t accompanied by such insidiously catchy, bass-heavy rave pop. With Hong Kong&apos;s enormous entertainment industry diversifying away from Cantonese, and the mainland&apos;s scene flickering into life, there&apos;s no telling how long Taiwan will retain pole position in the Mandopop world. For now, though, it&apos;s without equal in serving as a conduit for the flow of talent and ideas between Mandarin-speaking communities internationally and as a window on Chinese-language pop for the rest of the world."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/jan/05/wonderland-tv-review", "publicationDate": "2012-01-05T22:04:00Z", "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture", "Women", "Life and style"], "sentences": ["Her mum, Kate, a facility management consultant from Taiwan, is very strict and ambitious for Juliette, and wants her to\u00a0become a doctor or a lawyer.", "Geordie-Taiwanese, it&apos;s the perfect combination."], "title": "TV review: Wonderland | Eternal Law", "article": "Parents \u2013 mothers, especially \u2013 did you see Wonderland (BBC2)?

Her boy, Matthew, isn&apos;t hanging round on any street corners, or looting Footlocker. Well, he is only six, but I don&apos;t think he will be later. Corner hanging and looting aren&apos;t on the timetable. Matthew&apos;s timetable is terrifying. Every day of the week, Saturdays and Sundays too, are divided up into 15-minute squares of misery \u2013 Chinese reading, Chinese writing, English spelling, piano, maths tests, etc. The maths test is last thing before bedtime \u2013 on a\u00a0Sunday! Ah, at least there is a period of &quot;football in the garden&quot; too. But then we see it \u2013 Matthew kicking a ball on his own, tackling himself, passing to himself \u2013 and it doesn&apos;t look quite so fun. He does a lot of skipping too \u2013 got the record at the school skipathon, 128 skips in a minute. There are two little girls who live next door but Matthew knows them only from looking through the net curtains or a hole in the fence. He did go in their house once, he says, though this seems to surprise his dad. Yes, there is a dad. Steeve with a double e is a thoughtful man not overflowing with self-confidence. Sally is clearly the boss. She&apos;s actually really nice, in spite of her brutal regime. Funny too. And she admits she was a bit of a rebel in her youth. But it&apos;s harder now \u2013 you need to give kids a head start. Vivian, another tiger mum, is even scarier. &quot;Do that one again,&quot; she tells her six-year-old daughter Nathalie who&apos;s having problems with a tricky section in a piano piece. And she keeps saying it \u2013 &quot;again&quot; and &quot;that&apos;s not right&quot;, until Nathalie finally gets it. See? It works. Well, the notes are right \u2013 I don&apos;t hear much feeling in the music, but maybe that&apos;s not important. Vivian does sometimes have her doubts about her methods. &quot;If I&apos;m pushing them and I say: &apos;Do it again, do it again&apos; and then they say: &apos;I can&apos;t do it&apos; and they start crying, then I doubt,&quot; she admits. &quot;I think: OK, am I hurting them emotionally somehow? But then I think: they can do it ... I can&apos;t let them stop until they do it, because then they&apos;ll learn to give up.&quot; I&apos;m making it out to be all tears and whip-cracking. It&apos;s not; the kids seem nice \u2013 quite tired perhaps, and a little lonely, but not desperately unhappy. And Hannah Berryman&apos;s excellent film is a lesson in observational documentary \u2013 measured, calm, objective. She probes gently from behind the camera \u2013 where do you stand on praise, do you ever do playdays? \u2013 but it&apos;s about finding out, not setting traps. I don&apos;t think anyone here will feel cheated or misrepresented. I got a funny mixture of horror and admiration from it. Poor little Matthew, yawning, and playing football alone. And Nathalie - doing it again and again until she gets it right. But they will go\u00a0on to get straight A*s and become dentists and accountants (which apparently is a good thing). Look at your kids ... exactly, you can&apos;t, because you don&apos;t know where they are. Footlocker most likely. Little Juliette has it best, I think. Her mum, Kate, a facility management consultant from Taiwan, is very strict and ambitious for Juliette, and wants her to\u00a0become a doctor or a lawyer. Dad\u00a0Michael, a handyman, isn&apos;t that bothered, so long as Juliette is happy. Michael&apos;s from Newcastle. Geordie-Taiwanese, it&apos;s the perfect combination. Ho wei the lads. Eternal Law (ITV1) is a very odd one. A pair of angel-lawyers fly down to Earth in order to save it, or at least make it a better place. That seems to be\u00a0the premise. I guess it&apos;s trying to combine the tension of the courtroom with the magic of fantasy drama, which is very popular at the moment. There are some nice performances \u2013 most notably from Tobias Menzies who is some kind of bad demon-prosecutor. But I wasn&apos;t really sure if I was meant to be laughing, or moved, or charmed or what \u2013 and ended up being none of the above. Just baffled.

But amid all the president&apos;s talk about a leaner American military, evolving challenges of the new century, and shifting priorities after a decade of warfare, one particular word was nowhere to be heard: China. The omission is understandable, but misleading. As a politician running for re-election as a peacemaker, Obama has no wish to conjure the spectre of a new cold war with the only serious challenger to America as number one global superpower. But as his recent Asian tour made clear, Obama \u2013 born in Hawaii \u2013 is determined to beat back any Chinese bid for hegemony in Asia-Pacific. The focus of the strategy is concentrated on this cockpit region. As chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Martin Dempsey likewise has no interest in starting a fight with Beijing so soon after extricating US forces from Baghdad. But Dempsey knows China&apos;s defence spending is growing each year. As the strategy document urges, this growth &quot;must be accompanied by greater clarity [about] strategic intentions in order to avoid causing friction in the region&quot;. Dempsey sees how China&apos;s submarines and missile platforms, soon to be backed up by an aircraft carrier taskforce, are projecting naval power into regions where the US has dominated since 1945. In short, he can read the writing on the Chinese wall and understands that one day, however reluctantly, the US military may be obliged to overtly confront China just as it faced down the old Soviet Union. &quot;The strategy talks about a shift to the future,&quot; Dempsey said, standing alongside Obama at the Pentagon. &quot;And all of the trends, demographic trends, geopolitical trends, economic trends and military trends are shifting toward the Pacific. So our strategic challenges will largely emanate out of the Pacific region, but also the littorals of the Indian Ocean.&quot; Still no specific mention of China. But there was no doubting who and what Dempsey was talking about. And in case anybody missed the point, the US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, drove it home with due deference to both sides&apos; political sensibilities. &quot;This region is growing in importance to the future of the US economy and our national security. This means, for instance, improving capabilities that maintain our military&apos;s technological edge and freedom of action,&quot; he said. Beijing has yet to give a direct response. But the Global Times, an offshoot of the Communist party&apos;s People&apos;s Daily, swiftly made it clear China would be ready to match the US step for step, wherever that uncharted path might lead. &quot;Of course we want to prevent a new cold war with the United States, but at the same time, we must avoid giving up China&apos;s security presence in the neighbouring region,&quot; it said in an editorial. The Xinhua news agency warned that increased US engagement could boost stability but warned American militarism might &quot;endanger peace&quot;. The parameters of the coming 21st century US-China contest are already fairly clear. In purely physical terms, they include obvious potential flashpoints such as Taiwan, last resting place of the defeated nationalist Kuomintang. Beijing regards Taiwan as a &quot;renegade province&quot;. Although bilateral relations have improved of late, itChina still menaces Taipei across the Taiwan strait with hundreds of land-based missiles. As de facto guarantor of Taiwan&apos;s security and chief arms supplier, the US is caught in a frozen conflict that could catch fire at any time. China&apos;s pursuit of territorial and resource claims in disputed archipelagos across the East and South China seas provide other flashpoints, not just with the US but with neighbours such as Vietnam, which have been tightening security ties with Washington. Fears about the implications of China&apos;s rise are producing a similar circling of the wagons in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and Australia, notwithstanding their close trading relationships with Beijing. During his Asian tour, Obama signalled the opening of a military base in Darwin and possibly one in the Philippines. Ballistic missile defence co-operation with Tokyo is well advanced, although this has more to do with North Korea than China. Amid overall global troop cuts, the US military presence in South Korea and Japan will be maintained. Safeguarding international sea lanes is a key priority. The US-China standoff has numerous other potential and actual aspects. In geo-strategic terms, Washington&apos;s desire to manage if not contain China&apos;s ambitions lies behind the rapprochement with India begun by the Bush administration. China&apos;s efforts to expand its presence in the Indian Ocean, through trade, aid and investment deals with Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania, to name three, are seen in Delhi as the south Asian equivalent of America&apos;s perceived &quot;encirclement&quot; of China. The US took on China at its own game in Burma, expanding diplomatic relations with an unpleasant regime to counter Beijing&apos;s position as a key ally. The desire to support democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi is genuine. But calculated self-interest was at work, too. Perhaps somebody should tell William Hague. On a bigger scale again, a battle for raw materials, economic resources, political influence and military footholds is under way in sub-Saharan Africa, where China has placed commercial advantage ahead of governance and human rights concerns, and increasingly in Latin America. US behaviour is not exemplary, either. It talks a lot about democracy but its chief concern, especially in the Maghreb and Sahel regions, is security and terrorism, hence the recent creation of the Pentagon&apos;s Africa Command. China also presents a growing diplomatic and political challenge, whether it be through its protection of North Korea or its reluctance to support action against problematic regimes such as Syria, Iran and, arguably, Sudan. China&apos;s failure to act responsibly as a &quot;good citizen&quot; on the world stage, as American critics see it, is mirrored economically by its policy of maintaining an artificially under-valued currency to boost its exports, and its reluctance to help bail out stricken eurozone economies in the absence of specific rewards. The fact that it is by far the biggest holder of American government debt is a two-edged sword \u2013 but undoubtedly places Washington at a potential disadvantage. A 21st century US-China cold war is not an inevitability. It&apos;s possible the relationship can be managed to the benefit of both sides, given goodwill, good leadership and good luck. But fundamental ideological differences about democracy, openness, values, and religious belief, compounding political and economic rivalries, may ultimately confound efforts to work together. Historically, China is behaving just like any other up and coming great power, just like Britain in the 19th century and the US in the 20th: confident, brash and convinced of its own superiority. Obama&apos;s defence strategy hopes for the best \u2013 and prepares for the worst."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jan/09/wok-injury-improbable-research", "publicationDate": "2012-01-09T16:30:01Z", "tags": ["Research", "Higher education", "Education"], "sentences": ["That&apos;s bad, say Swei-Pi Wu and Cheng-Pin Ho at Huafan University, and Chin-Li Yen at National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Taiwan."], "title": "Wok research: bigger is not better", "article": "The Effect of Wok Size and Handle Angle on the Maximum Acceptable Weights of Wok Flipping by Male Cooks, a report in the journal Industrial Health, does more than its title reveals.

This non-neutral posture, accompanied by high torque and a high rate of repetition is very apt to cause cumulative trauma disorder injuries in the user&apos;s upper extremity.&quot; Wu, Ho and Yen had 12 experienced Chinese cooks repeatedly flip woks of three different sizes, with handles at five different angles. The tricky part was standardising the repetitions for all those people over all those wok-size-and-handle-angle combinations. Their main tool used was a loudspeaker. They required the cooks to follow a strict protocol. The central part ran like this: Flip the wok nine times, adding or removing soybeans if the wok feels too light or too heavy. The loudspeaker says: &quot;Adjust the weight, for the last time!&quot; Flip once more. The loudspeaker says: &quot;Please hold the culinary spatula!&quot; The loudspeaker says &quot;Ready!&quot;, then two seconds later says: &quot;Begin!&quot; Lift the wok and shake it, three times, with the non-dominant hand, lifting the culinary spatula with the dominant hand, &quot;to perform the simulated food stir-frying task, first from right to left and then from left to right and from front to back, three times in total&quot;. Then put the wok down. Repeat this cycle eight times. Wu is an old hand at creating such tests. In 1995 he and a colleague published a study called Effects of the Handle Diameter and Tip Angle of Chopsticks on the Food-Serving Performance of Male Subjects. Three years earlier, he and a different colleague had published a treatise called An Investigation for Determining the Optimum Length Of Chopsticks. Those two studies left some gaps in our knowledge of chopstick optimisation. A researcher named Tam Chan filled those gaps in 1999 with a paper called A Study for Determining the Optimum Diameter of Chopsticks.

The Brandling Villa, in South Gosforth, Newcastle has started serving up an imported non-alcoholic beer with hops, malt and meat extract to give its pet-owning punters no excuse for staying away - particularly as the pub already serves up a range of dog-friendly dishes like &quot;chicken a la franc&quot; and &quot;Eggs Ladybird&quot;. The &quot;beer&quot; is obviously hitting the spot for its four-legged demographic, as the first 48 bottle run sold out in less than a fortnight despite the pub&apos;s owner admitting that his own dog doesn&apos;t like the &quot;pretty revolting&quot; brew.It&apos;s not the first dog beer to hit the market. Bowser Beer from Phoenix, USA, and selling at $19.99 for a pack of 6, proudly declares itself to be carbonation-, alcohol- and hop-free and made with USDA chicken or beef and is seemingly equally popular - all stocks are sold out and won&apos;t be available again until mid-January. On this side of the pond, one Yorkshire pub has got in on the act. The King&apos;s Head in Gunnerside stocks Dutch pet care giant Beaphar&apos;s dog beer for service alongside &quot;home roasted pig cheeks&quot; at 40p a pop - a bargain in a culinary climate where offal has an increasing cachet. But are pets really welcome in eating and drinking establishments from the bipedal customer&apos;s point of view? A quick straw poll showed a distinct split between those who believe that a &quot;well-behaved dog in a pub is one of the glories of England&quot; and the virulently opposed, who think they &quot;stink, make a racket and jump up at people&quot;. There&apos;s also a difference in opinion about a pets&apos; place in a restaurant as opposed to a pub. Craig Butcher, editor of MSN Food, believes that dogs in &quot;pubs [are] fine, but restaurants - no&quot; and I&apos;m inclined to agree. Pets, like children, are a disruptive influence. In the more relaxed atmosphere of a pub meal, that element of barely-contained chaos that pets and children share is not necessarily an issue. But in the more formal setting of a restaurant - where the meal is, to a greater extent than in even the best gastropub, an event that goes beyond the quality of the food - they impact upon and detract from the experience. Obviously, there are those who feel very differently - the cat caf\u00e9s of Japan are proof positive of that. In these caf\u00e9s, in return for an hourly cover fee punters share the space with a clowder of resident cats - though even these establishments have rules regarding small children for fear that they&apos;ll disturb the main attraction. Cat caf\u00e9s have proven wildly popular. The first opened in Taiwan in 1998 before spreading to Japan in 2004. Now, there are at least 39 cat caf\u00e9s in Tokyo alone, and variations which specialise in housing black cats, rare cats and even fat cats. The success of Japan&apos;s cat caf\u00e9s can be put down to the tight apartment spaces in which pets are often forbidden, but the motivations for bringing a pet to a restaurant are a little less clear. Obviously some pets can&apos;t be left alone (though this is surely a relatively easily circumvented issue) and as a former pet owner I do understand the emotional bond to one&apos;s furry companion, but can they be anything but a hindrance when trying to socialize with one&apos;s same-species friends? Would you like to be able to take your pet with you when you eat out? Or does the idea of having a dog in the dining room set you on edge? And does it matter whether it&apos;s a caf\u00e9, a gastropub or a full-blown restaurant?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/13/taiwan-election-china-us", "publicationDate": "2012-01-13T12:26:31Z", "tags": ["Taiwan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China", "US foreign policy"], "sentences": ["Select a twig of laurel from the board in front of him and, pledges fortune teller Zhang Tianyao, &quot;I can tell you things about your career, marriage, how many kids you will have and your future.&quot; But ask him for a more immediate prediction \u2014 the outcome of Saturday&apos;s neck-and-neck race for Taiwan&apos;s presidency \u2014 and he turns decidedly coy.", "Taiwan has been self-ruled since Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s defeated Kuomintang retreated across the Taiwan Strait at the end of China&apos;s civil war in 1949.", "But Beijing yearns for reunification and refuses to rule out military action if Taiwan formally declares independence.", "&quot;It matters because it is such a central question to the world&apos;s two biggest economies,&quot; said Clayton Dube, of the University of Southern California&apos;s US-China Institute, who is in Taiwan to observe the election.", "&quot;Polls show that two-thirds to three-quarters of Chinese people think if there&apos;s going to be a conflict with the US it will be over Taiwan.&quot; In contrast, only a handful of American voters identify it as a major issue; Washington wants to ensure it does not dominate bilateral relations.", "While outsiders contemplate the election&apos;s impact on international security, Taiwan&apos;s 18 million voters seem more interested in their employment and income prospects.", "The savvy campaign by the DPP, traditionally strong in the agricultural south and among the working classes, has focused on economic and social justice rather than Taiwanese identity.", "It will not do any good for Taiwan,&quot; Ma told reporters on Thursday.", "If all those concessions don&apos;t bring in Taiwanese votes, hardliners will say they should not do this,&quot; added Yen.", "Dialogues might well stagnate and Beijing could choke off tourism, a newly lucrative business for Taiwan, or poach one of the handful of tiny territories that still recognise it diplomatically.", "The economic outlook is another complication, warned Wu Jau-shieh, Taiwan&apos;s chief representative to the US under Chen and now a political analyst at the National Chengchi University.", "&quot;Whether Tsai or Ma wins, I think all sides have been reminded that pressuring Taiwan to move towards political negotiations, under the guise of a peace accord, is not an option,&quot; said Professor Christopher Hughes of the London School of Economics."], "title": "Taiwan election too close to call as China and US look on", "article": "Select a twig of laurel from the board in front of him and, pledges fortune teller Zhang Tianyao, &quot;I can tell you things about your career, marriage, how many kids you will have and your future.&quot; But ask him for a more immediate prediction \u2014 the outcome of Saturday&apos;s neck-and-neck race for Taiwan&apos;s presidency \u2014 and he turns decidedly coy. He does not even know which way he will vote. One issue tops his list of concerns, he says as he waits for customers at Taipei&apos;s Raohe night market, clad in a brown cowboy hat and navy Sun Yat-Sen suit. &quot;My priority is for cross-straits relations to be peaceful,&quot; he says; a response that helps to explain why the election&apos;s outcome will resonate far beyond the island&apos;s shores, in Washington and Beijing. Taiwan has been self-ruled since Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s defeated Kuomintang retreated across the Taiwan Strait at the end of China&apos;s civil war in 1949. But Beijing yearns for reunification and refuses to rule out military action if Taiwan formally declares independence. While the Kuomintang president, Ma Ying-jeou, has overseen an unprecedented thaw in cross-straits relations, hundreds of Chinese missiles still point across the straits. The US government, obliged by an act of Congress to help the island defend itself, wants to ensure stability. Now Tsai Ing-wen of the pro-independence Democratic People&apos;s party \u2014 who would be the first female president if elected \u2014 has slashed Ma&apos;s initially commanding lead. The race has appeared relatively calm compared with previous turbulent and occasionally violent contests \u2014 though a woman with a knife was bundled out of the DPP office on Friday. But as the candidates criss-crossed the island in a last-minute frenzy of campaigning, analysts judged the outcome too close to call. &quot;It matters because it is such a central question to the world&apos;s two biggest economies,&quot; said Clayton Dube, of the University of Southern California&apos;s US-China Institute, who is in Taiwan to observe the election. &quot;Polls show that two-thirds to three-quarters of Chinese people think if there&apos;s going to be a conflict with the US it will be over Taiwan.&quot; In contrast, only a handful of American voters identify it as a major issue; Washington wants to ensure it does not dominate bilateral relations. Keeping things on an even keel may be even more important, and tricky, given the Obama administration&apos;s shift to a China-focused security strategy. The US has not formally indicated a preference, but analysts say Washington is clearly hoping for another KMT victory. Ma&apos;s leadership has seen the introduction of the first direct flights, postal services and shipping routes for six decades and an Economic Co-operation Framework Agreement to ease trade. Beijing has even sent across a pair of giant pandas, whose names together mean &quot;reunion&quot;. But critics say his presidency has otherwise been lacklustre, citing issues such as the government&apos;s handling of Typhoon Morakot in 2008. Growth quickly returned following the same year&apos;s financial crisis, but incomes are barely recovering, bolstering claims that Ma, 61, has been good for big business but bad for the ordinary worker. While outsiders contemplate the election&apos;s impact on international security, Taiwan&apos;s 18 million voters seem more interested in their employment and income prospects. &quot;The political issues date back many decades, but it&apos;s not an issue these candidates can solve in a day. For people the only thing that matters is economic stability,&quot; says Zhang, the fortune teller. The savvy campaign by the DPP, traditionally strong in the agricultural south and among the working classes, has focused on economic and social justice rather than Taiwanese identity. Tsai&apos;s calm competence \u2013 the 51-year-old is a former academic with an LSE doctorate, as well as an experienced negotiator \u2013 has impressed swing voters turned off the party by its in-fighting and corruption claims (former president Chen Shui-bian is in jail for money laundering and misuse of public funds). The race is complicated by the third candidate, James Soong of the People First party, who cannot win but could become kingmaker if the PFP picked up enough seats. Tsai has floated the idea of a coalition. The DPP leader has also toned down the party&apos;s rhetoric on cross-straits relations to counter the KMT&apos;s suggestion that voters must choose between stability and uncertainty. &quot;We don&apos;t want to provoke China as the previous administration did for eight years. It will not do any good for Taiwan,&quot; Ma told reporters on Thursday. Although Beijing has been strikingly quiet so far \u2013 attempts to exert influence have backfired in previous elections \u2013 the opposition claims authorities have pressured businessmen based on the mainland to support the KMT. Should the DPP win, &quot;Tsai will not want to rock the boat and the US and China will not want to undo four years of improving ties&quot;, suggested Jonathan Sullivan of the University of Nottingham, whose Ballots and Bullets blog has chronicled the campaign. But he noted: &quot;Chen Shui-bian was moderate from 2000-2001 and Beijing ignored and undermined him at all times, which, combined with the KMT&apos;s obstructionism, led him to a more radical position. A pessimist would say that neither the CCP [Chinese Communist party] nor KMT have changed, so why should Tsai fare different?&quot; &quot;I think [Beijing] will say: if we don&apos;t show any differences we lose credibility,&quot; said Yen Chen-shi of the institute of international relations at the National Chengchi University in Taipei. The transfer of power to new leaders on the mainland this year creates further uncertainty. &quot;Hu [Jintao] is considered the most conciliatory Chinese leader. If all those concessions don&apos;t bring in Taiwanese votes, hardliners will say they should not do this,&quot; added Yen. Dialogues might well stagnate and Beijing could choke off tourism, a newly lucrative business for Taiwan, or poach one of the handful of tiny territories that still recognise it diplomatically. The economic outlook is another complication, warned Wu Jau-shieh, Taiwan&apos;s chief representative to the US under Chen and now a political analyst at the National Chengchi University. He feared China might turn to nationalism if domestic unrest emerged amid a downturn. DPP supporters argue there is no such thing as maintaining the status quo. They believe Beijing will press harder for political talks should Ma win. But his poll ratings plummeted when he mooted the possibility of a peace deal during the campaign. &quot;Whether Tsai or Ma wins, I think all sides have been reminded that pressuring Taiwan to move towards political negotiations, under the guise of a peace accord, is not an option,&quot; said Professor Christopher Hughes of the London School of Economics."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/13/taiwan-elections-strait-and-narrow", "publicationDate": "2012-01-13T23:12:00Z", "tags": ["Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The Taishang, the million Taiwanese who work in China, are rushing back home to vote in Saturday&apos;s presidential and legislative elections, urged on by their mainland bosses to vote for the incumbent nationalist candidate because he has established calmer cross-strait relations.", "Taiwan&apos;s founding existential issue, its relationship with China, is nowadays only one of a number on the campaign agenda.", "He has much to crow about: 16 separate agreements, 558 direct flights a week between nine destinations in Taiwan and 41 in China, the first direct postal services and shipping routes for six decades.", "With hundreds of missiles pointing at Taiwan, the point about the use of force is obvious.", "The Taiwan elections matter, especially in a region where so many of the players are going through changes of regime.", "China&apos;s leader Hu Jintao is considered a moderate on Taiwan.", "But if what are seen by Beijing as its concessions do not get the votes they think are due them in Taiwan, the cross-straits policy could again revert to hardline nationalism."], "title": "Taiwan elections: strait and narrow", "article": "The Taishang, the million Taiwanese who work in China, are rushing back home to vote in Saturday&apos;s presidential and legislative elections, urged on by their mainland bosses to vote for the incumbent nationalist candidate because he has established calmer cross-strait relations. They will be carried on their way by discounted tickets, extra flights and paid holidays, in the organisation of which China is only too keen to collaborate. How things have changed. Not all Taishang will necessarily vote for the incumbent Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang. Taiwan&apos;s founding existential issue, its relationship with China, is nowadays only one of a number on the campaign agenda. If you take China&apos;s definition of independence, both Mr Ma and his challenger Tsai Ing-wen, from the Democratic Progressive party, are pro-independence. They may disagree on the eventual long-term outcome, but in reality the gap between the two parties on this issue is often overestimated. Mr Ma has been keen to keep the campaign focused on the peace he has established with China. He has much to crow about: 16 separate agreements, 558 direct flights a week between nine destinations in Taiwan and 41 in China, the first direct postal services and shipping routes for six decades. Mr Ma wants to instituretionalise the status quo: &quot;no independence, no reunification and no use of force&quot;. With hundreds of missiles pointing at Taiwan, the point about the use of force is obvious. The missiles are on mobile launchers, but for all China&apos;s relative warmth towards Mr Ma \u2013 including the gift of a pair of giant pandas whose names together mean reunion \u2013 it has not moved them away. Mr Ma is struggling on the home front, and it is on this turf that his main challenger Miss Tsai, a calmly competent negotiator and LSE-trained former academic, has made inroads into the KMT&apos;s once unassailable lead. Mr Ma&apos;s party represents big business, while Miss Tsai, whose DPP is strong in the agricultural south and among urban workers, has campaigned on wage inequality and social justice. A third candidate, James Soong of the People First party, is also contesting the presidency; if he gets 6-7%, it would be bad news for Mr Ma&apos;s campaign. Today&apos;s legislative election is as important as the presidential one, and will ensure whether the new president has the power to legislate. The Taiwan elections matter, especially in a region where so many of the players are going through changes of regime. China&apos;s leader Hu Jintao is considered a moderate on Taiwan. But if what are seen by Beijing as its concessions do not get the votes they think are due them in Taiwan, the cross-straits policy could again revert to hardline nationalism."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/14/taiwan-voters-return-ma-ying-jeou", "publicationDate": "2012-01-14T18:40:00Z", "tags": ["Taiwan", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["Taiwanese politics are vibrant, emotional, sometimes dirty and occasionally violent.", "&quot;This is not my personal victory; this victory belongs to the Taiwanese people,&quot; the 61-year-old told supporters.", "Beijing claims sovereignty over the self-governed island and has refused to rule out military action if Taiwan declares formal independence.", "While polls had shown Tsai edging towards her rival at one point, the scale of the victory gave Ma an unequivocal mandate, said Jonathan Sullivan, an expert on Taiwan at Nottingham University.", "It is not hard to find diehard supporters on either side who accuse the Kuomintang of selling out Taiwan or the DPP of being dangerous firebrands.", "That Taiwan did not see presidential elections until 1996, and elected its first non-Kuomintang leader four years later, helps explain why politics is a passion here.", "Across the Taiwan strait, where the Chinese Communist party has limited coverage of the contest, at least some Chinese citizens were watching.", "&quot;Saw Taiwan election on Weibo.", "&quot;[China&apos;s leaders] don&apos;t want a lot of mainlanders coming here and watching democracy in action,&quot; said Stanley Rosen of the University of Southern California, who was in Taiwan to watch the election.", "&quot;They like to show the legislature and people fighting each other...

Outside the Kuomintang&apos;s Taipei headquarters, the victors smiled under thin plastic hoods, cheering in relief as much as in celebration. Across town, the defeated opposition&apos;s supporters seemed subdued. Taiwanese politics are vibrant, emotional, sometimes dirty and occasionally violent. Some might have expected stronger reactions after a race too close to call culminated in yesterday&apos;s re-election of incumbent Ma Ying-jeou, who has overseen an unprecedented rapprochement with China. But the muted response to his victory \u2013 he took 51.6% of the vote to challenger Tsai Ing-wen&apos;s 45.6% \u2013 echoed an unusually calm campaign. Some observers think this youthful democracy&apos;s fifth presidential election offers hope that its politics are evolving from what one voter described as &quot;two parties shouting at each other&quot;. The improved performance by the Democratic Progressive party (DPP) also indicates that voters will continue to have an alternative to the Kuomintang. Some had feared the party was sliding to oblivion after its disastrous performance in 2008. Ma saw off an impressive campaign by the DPP&apos;s Tsai, who would have been the first female president. &quot;This is not my personal victory; this victory belongs to the Taiwanese people,&quot; the 61-year-old told supporters. Tsai stepped down as DPP leader as she conceded defeat. A third candidate, James Soong of the People First party, polled just 2.8% of the vote. The result was a relief for Beijing, displeased by the re-emergence of the pro-independence DPP, despite Tsai&apos;s care in moderating the party&apos;s rhetoric. The election was watched closely in Washington, amid fears of potential instability. &quot;Beijing, Washington and even Australia will all breathe better with a Ma victory,&quot; Bruce Jacobs, a China expert at Monash University in Australia, told the Associated Press. Beijing claims sovereignty over the self-governed island and has refused to rule out military action if Taiwan declares formal independence. But hostility has softened under Ma, under whose regime the two sides have struck an important economic deal and established the first direct air, postal and shipping links since the defeated Kuomintang retreated across the strait after losing the Chinese civil war six decades ago. While polls had shown Tsai edging towards her rival at one point, the scale of the victory gave Ma an unequivocal mandate, said Jonathan Sullivan, an expert on Taiwan at Nottingham University. &quot;Ma was very clear about what he was offering ... if people didn&apos;t want that they had the opportunity to say so.&quot; The Kuomintang campaign suggested voters faced a choice between the benefits of the closer economic ties he has forged and uncertainty under Tsai. Meanwhile, the DPP accused Ma of failing ordinary voters and pledged to improve the lives of workers. It is not hard to find diehard supporters on either side who accuse the Kuomintang of selling out Taiwan or the DPP of being dangerous firebrands. But one DPP activist sought to put the contest into a broader perspective. &quot;If we win or lose \u2013 to me, even getting here today is a remarkable achievement,&quot; said Chiu Chui-chen, hours before polls opened. Chiu, 61, spent five years in prison during the 1980s due to his pro-democracy activities. Back then, he had struggled to imagine voting. That Taiwan did not see presidential elections until 1996, and elected its first non-Kuomintang leader four years later, helps explain why politics is a passion here. The closing rallies on Friday night epitomised the carnival spirit, with tens of thousands packing each venue. Their roars of approval rivalled the volume of bullhorns and vuvuzelas as they waved flags and cheered their candidates on. Outside the Bancai sports stadium, where Tsai held her final event, vendors did a brisk trade in T-shirts, dolls and other campaign paraphenalia. Hours later, voters clambered onto buses and trains, travelling hours across the island to reach their registered polling station. Around 200,000 returned from overseas to cast their vote. Across the Taiwan strait, where the Chinese Communist party has limited coverage of the contest, at least some Chinese citizens were watching. The popular Sina Weibo microblog service even posted an election counter. &quot;Saw Taiwan election on Weibo. I hope China can have elections too. But the country&apos;s situation doesn&apos;t allow that,&quot; wrote one user. In Taipei, Chinese tour groups said they had been told to stay away from campaigning and some had even been told to stay inside on polling day. &quot;[China&apos;s leaders] don&apos;t want a lot of mainlanders coming here and watching democracy in action,&quot; said Stanley Rosen of the University of Southern California, who was in Taiwan to watch the election. &quot;They like to show the legislature and people fighting each other... [It&apos;s the idea that] democracy is inherently unstable.&quot; Taiwan&apos;s electoral history is certainly troubled. In the most notorious incident, DPP incumbent Chen Shui-bian was shot on the eve of the 2004 poll. The incident remains controversial, not least because of its impact on the next day&apos;s vote, which he won by just 0.2%; opponents claimed he had staged it. This race has seen allegations \u2013 denied by Ma \u2013 that intelligence services spied on Tsai for the Kuomintang&apos;s political benefit. That resonated because of the party&apos;s authoritarian history. Meanwhile, Tsai denied Kuomintang claims that she had benefited inappropriately from a role in a state-backed business. But Kevin Hsu, the 24-year-old policy director of the First Voters group \u2013 a body encouraging political participation by the young \u2013 said that overall the campaign had benefited Taiwanese democracy. &quot;Compared with the [previous] elections, it&apos;s been peaceful and reasonable. We haven&apos;t had unrest. We haven&apos;t had bullets. Our democracy is young, but it&apos;s a learning process every four years.&quot; Yu Chen-hua, of the election study centre at National Chengchi University, noted that there had not been &quot;much passion&quot; in the race. Tsai had reached out to voters with a more rational tone than predecessors, who had tended to use strong rhetoric to consolidate support, he said. &quot;There were doubts in the DPP about whether Tsai had the right kind of personality because she is very much like a university professor, rather than a street fighter,&quot; said Christopher Hughes of the London School of Economics. But her &quot;academic, pragmatic style&quot; had turned out to be a real asset for the DPP, he added. He suggested she had alienated voters by returning to old-school street campaigning tactics in the last week. Even so, she restored her party&apos;s credibility after the last election, when Ma crushed Frank Hsieh with 58% of the vote to 42% . &quot;It has shown the two-party system is strong. In 2008, there were real fears that the DPP was finished,&quot; said Hughes. The Kuomintang has a reduced majority thanks to the simultaneous legislative election, although it still boasts 64 seats to the DPP&apos;s 40. Smaller parties claimed nine places. About 74% of Taiwan&apos;s 18 million voters are thought to have cast a ballot on Saturday, slightly below 2008 figures. Despite the cooler tone of the race, voters said young Taiwanese people still cared about politics. &quot;My generation is not as aggressive [about politics] as the people you always see on TV. People have got more rational,&quot; said Joseph Chiu, a 30-year-old salesman. &quot;But it&apos;s not that they are less passionate or that they are indifferent. They have just learned to respect each other.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/14/taiwanese-president-election-ma-china", "publicationDate": "2012-01-14T18:46:00Z", "tags": ["Taiwan", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s incumbent president, Ma Ying-jeou, who has overseen an unprecedented thaw in relations with China, has been re-elected decisively after a tight race.", "This victory belongs to Taiwanese people,&quot; the 61-year-old told thousands of Kuomintang (KMT) supporters who had gathered outside his Taipei headquarters despite the pouring rain.", "&quot;You can only interpret this as an unequivocal mandate \u2026 The KMT must be delighted,&quot; said Jonathan Sullivan, an expert on Taiwan at the University of Nottingham.", "Turnout is thought to have reached around 74% of the 18 million Taiwanese eligible to vote."], "title": "Taiwanese president's re-election soothes Chinese fears", "article": "Taiwan&apos;s incumbent president, Ma Ying-jeou, who has overseen an unprecedented thaw in relations with China, has been re-elected decisively after a tight race.

Tsai toned down her party&apos;s stance on cross-straits relations. &quot;Voters used their ballots to support us because we were on the right track to push for a peaceful cross-strait relationship and to gain diplomatic space,&quot; said the mayor of Taipei, Hau Long-bin, a KMT member.

It was widely reported that the rioters were hopeful shoppers who, having waited for hours in the freezing cold for the latest iPhone, were so furious when the launch was delayed that they threw eggs at the shop and clashed with the police. It turns out that many were actually migrant workers, hired by &quot;scalpers&quot; who intended to sell the gadget, a status symbol, for a higher price on the black market. Meanwhile, a protest of another kind was just ending in Wuhan, in central China&apos;s Hubei province, thanks to the intervention of its mayor. Up to 200 workers from the Microsoft Xbox production line of Foxconn Technology, also a major supplier of Apple, had staged a strike. They were not demanding sleek new gadgets, but simply decent pay in return for making them, and proper compensation if being transferred. To drive their point home, they had threatened to kill themselves by jumping off a building. In 2010, a total of 18 of their colleagues in the Shenzhen campus of the Taiwan-owned company did attempt suicide; 14 died. Some employees and labour organisations blamed a combination of factors for the workers&apos; deaths: low wages, long working hours \u2013 sometimes up to 16 hours a day \u2013 and inhuman treatment. Workers at the campus, some claimed, were not even allowed to talk during working hours. Like many other similar factories, Foxconn, the world&apos;s largest electronics manufacture, is staffed mostly by nongmin gong (peasant workers) because they are cheap. These migrants often have no friends in the city. I felt the pain of my fellow workers because I, too, slaved for 10 years at a factory and endured its strict rules. The restrictions at my state-owned factory, however, paled in comparison to those of cold-hearted capitalism. There is labour law that forbids a 16-hour working day, among other malpractices, but it is not forcefully implemented by the local authority. After all, the private or foreign-invested enterprises bring revenues. I was very pleased to see the migrant workers beginning to resist. Shortly after Foxconn&apos;s suicides, workers from several Japanese-owned Honda factories revolted. They went on strike until their demands for better pay and working conditions were met. In chatrooms on the internet, several Honda workers argued that it would be better to put up a fight than to take one&apos;s life. Compared with their fathers, the young workers are savvy about the internet, better educated, more worldly and far more aware of the law and their rights. Zhao Fengsheng, who has made a personal journey from a village boy in Hunan to a public intellectual in Beijing, is one of this new breed. When the 35-year-old left home to work in a nearby city, he first experienced discrimination against nongmin. He came to the conclusion that the problem is rooted in the system that separates nongmin from their urban cousins and deprives them of equal rights. In 2007, after Zhao moved to Beijing, he started to attend lectures and made friends with academics and rights activists. Two years later, he launched the China Farmers&apos; Association. Three days after he filed his application with the ministry of civil affairs, he was arrested, interrogated and his application was rejected. His organisation, now called a research centre, continues to send out articles to people on his mailing list. The list has grown from a few dozen to 500, the maximum on his email server. &quot;Generally, people become more rights conscious as the society progresses,&quot; Zhao said to me. &quot;And nongmin are no exception.&quot; He is one of the rare voices representing the underprivileged farmers. This year, there has been a wave of factory revolts across six provinces in China, according to Hong Kong-based China Workers&apos; Info. In Sichuan province, hundreds of workers stormed a courthouse in Shuangliu county as they were fighting for a case over unpaid wages. The labour unrest has been caused partly by rising inflation, which hit those at the bottom of society the hardest. With the traditional Chinese new year approaching, the migrant workers find it particularly difficult to cope with their daily grind. Many protests were inspired by the Wukan incident. The village in southern China&apos;s Guangdong province grabbed headlines around the world after hundreds of its villagers staged well-organised protests to express their anger against the corrupt local officials and land seizure, and the conflicts escalated in the wake of an attempted crackdown by the local authority. The intensive standoff ended in late December, when top provincial leaders agreed to some of their demands. I was relieved and delighted by the approach the authorities have taken in both the Wukan and Wuhan cases: they have clearly recognised nongmin&apos;s rising demands for rights and equality. But a soft approach alone isn&apos;t enough. I hope China&apos;s leaders will really listen to the farmers, opening up more channels for them to express their grievances, and allowing some kind of independent labour union or at least a collective bargaining mechanism to ease the conflicts. And ultimately, they&apos;ll have to grant the same rights to those who make gadgets such as the Xbox and iPhone as those who use them. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/jan/17/inside-guardian-weekly-20-january", "publicationDate": "2012-01-17T14:50:31Z", "tags": [], "sentences": ["From Asia, Taiwan re-elects a leader who has overseen unprecedented rapprochement with China, much to Beijing&apos;s relief, and Burma frees some important political prisoners."], "title": "Inside the 20 January edition", "article": "Is China looking at a hard landing?

The court overturned an earlier decision in Essar&apos;s favour, which relates to a scheme whereby the company has been able to defer the repayment of sales tax. So far it has benefited to the tune of $1.24bn, but this looks like it will now come to an end. The company - 77% owned by Indian conglomerate Essar - was originally due to repay the tax from 2021 onwards, but the ruling means it is unclear when the payments will now start. Essar - which floated at 420p a share in 2010 - plunged 45.4p to 127p, making it the biggest faller in the leading index. Overall, stronger than expected Chinese growth figures and a number of successful European bond auctions helped overcome the continuing nervousness over the eurozone crisis. By the close the FTSE 100 had climbed 36.51 points to 5693.95. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said:  Today&apos;s market movements in London have been dominated by GDP figures from China which showed that growth in the world&apos;s second biggest economy is slowing less than expected. One of the major issues going into this year has been whether China&apos;s economy will land soft or hard and today&apos;s figures are evidence that a softer landing is more likely. This means that the power house behind global growth is set to continue growing strongly, which will benefit London stocks in the FTSE 100 because of their global reach.  Mining shares were among the risers following the figures from China, a key consumer of commodities. Rio Tinto rose 105p to \u00a336.94 while Kazakhmys climbed 21p to \u00a310.88. Royal Bank of Scotland ended 0.43p higher at 24.85p after it sold its aircraft leasing business to Japan&apos;s Sumitomo for $7.3bn. Shore Capital moved from sell to hold, with analyst Gary Greenwood saying:  Although the deal won&apos;t have a material impact on the overall financial position of the group, we view this as another important milestone in the run-down of the non-core portfolio.   But catering group Compass dipped 2.5p to 607.5p after RBC reduced its rating from sector perform to underperform. RBC said:  Compass has maintained an impressive track record over the last four years. The focus on margins, improving returns, and strengthening the balance sheet has driven the valuation up to a PE of over 14 times for fiscal 2012 on our numbers, and we believe the stock needs upgrades to maintain that valuation here. While we have been a big supporter of the story, we have become increasingly more cautious on the stock as its valuation rose, and with the recent run, we now move to underperform.  SABMiller slipped 23p to \u00a323.04 ahead of a third quarter trading update on Thursday. Pablo Zuanic at Liberum Capital said he expected sales volumes to be below the company&apos;s guidance, with only the Latin American and African businesses doing better. Nor did he believe recent speculation about possible bid interest from Anheuser-Busch InBev. He said:  We are sceptical of market talk of a take over. ABI would be interested only in the Andean part [in South America], so this would require Heineken and Diageo to also get involved. Heineken is digesting Femsa, and Diageo may be going through a transition.  Phil Carroll at Shore Capital was generally positive on the company but said he would not discourage profit taking ahead of the update:  SAB does face some headwinds short term, including the adverse impact on results from foreign exchange translation on the back of the dollar strengthening against a number of its emerging market exposures. Raw material cost inflation is also putting some pressure on margins, along with ongoing business investment.  Elsewhere packaging group DS Smith added 6.6p to 210.2p after it splashed out \u00a31.3bn to boost its business in Europe. Just weeks after completing the sale of its office products business Spicer for \u00a3160m, Smith is buying the packaging business of Sweden&apos;s Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget. The move takes it into new markets across Europe, and pushes Smith closer to its target of being &quot;the leading supplier of recycled packaging for consumer goods in Europe.&quot; The SCA business employs 12,000 people and the size of the deal means it is classified as a reverse takeover. It is being funded by a combination of debt and a nine-for-eight rights issue at a deeply discounted 95p a share to raise \u00a3466m. Analyst Hector Forsythe at Oriel Securities said:  Our initial reaction is that this is a big step and that comes with risk, but it&apos;s a leap in the strategy to become the leading European supplier of recycled packaging.    Afren added 15.5p to 130.5p after the exploration company said it had made a significant oil discovery at one of its wells off south east Nigeria. It will begin production tests over the next few weeks and also plans to start drilling off Ghana later this month. Credit Suisse repeated its outperform rating and raised its target price from 130p to 148p. The bank said:  We look forward to Afren&apos;s update on the exploration programme on January 23. Up to 14 wells in 2012, worth 32p a share on our risked net asset value with a blue sky upside of 173p a share, offer a balance of high-risk, high-impact exploration (Keta in Ghana, OPL30 in Nigeria) and lower risk exploration/appraisal (Jebel Simrit wells in the Kurdish region of Iraq, Ebok/Okwok/OML115 wells in Nigeria).

Authorities are mustering every weapon to see the problem off: from money to Chinese astrology and blind dates for its citizens. The island&apos;s plummeting birth rate is one of the lowest in the world, experts say, prompting a warning from the president himself, Ma Ying-jeou, that it is &quot;a serious national security threat&quot;. Taipei believes the year of the dragon, which began on Monday, is its last chance to turn things around. As an auspicious time for birth, each dragon year sees a sizable baby bump. By adding cash and other incentives, it hopes to produce a larger than usual increase to maintain its 23 million population. In industrialised countries, the average woman must have about 2.1 children to keep the population stable. In many places the fertility rate has dipped well below that \u2013 and in Taiwan it has plunged. In 1951, the average Taiwanese woman would have seven children. In 2010, the fertility rate was 0.89. The population is expected to start shrinking in the next 15 years. Equally worrying is its rapid ageing. About 14% of citizens are over 65. Within two decades, that will double. On current trends, it will become the oldest country in the world, warned Yang Wen-shan, a demographer at the Academia Sinica in Taipei: &quot;Right now, seven working people are supporting one older person. By 2045, 1.45 people will be supporting one.&quot; Numerous countries, from Japan to Germany, face a similar problem: not enough young people to care \u2013 or pay \u2013 for older citizens. But in Japan it took 40 years for the proportion of over-65s to rise from 7% to 20%. &quot;In Taiwan we think it is taking maybe 20. We have half the time to deal with it,&quot; said Yu Zhu-ping, head of population at Taipei city&apos;s civil affairs department. Most people still aspire to having two or more children. But they marry later \u2013 or not at all \u2013 and are more likely to divorce. They have their first child in their thirties and are often unable or unwilling to have another. Harold Li of the Child Welfare League Foundation blamed the cost of child-rearing \u2013 given stagnant salaries and high house prices and childcare fees \u2013 but also growing individualism. &quot;I think Taiwan&apos;s low fertility rate is absolutely a big problem,&quot; said Sean Lin, a 24-year-old doctor from Taipei. But he added: &quot;I not only don&apos;t want children, but also have no plans for marriage. It&apos;s not for economic reasons; I simply prefer more emotional freedom and believe that a family would be a burden.&quot; While his attitude is unusual, he says younger people are more accepting of childlessness. His girlfriend is happy with his choice and even his parents respect it. It is a striking shift in attitudes for a predominantly Chinese community. &quot;There is a traditional saying &apos;There are three ways of being unfilial to your parents \u2013 and having no children is the most serious,&apos; &quot; said Li. The comparison with the mainland is striking. Despite Beijing&apos;s &quot;one child&quot; policy \u2013 which has several exemptions \u2013 the fertility rate in China is still about 1.7. Liang Weixiao, who comes from southern China but married a Taiwanese man, says her siblings struggle to understand why she has only one son. &quot;My brother and sisters have one child each and wish they could have more. They say &apos;Look; there are no limits on birth controls in Taiwan \u2013 you can have two or three,&apos; &quot; said the 39-year-old. At first the couple felt they could not afford a second child. When they tried again Liang, by then in her late thirties, struggled to conceive. She thinks the effect on her six-year-old is obvious. &quot;He wasn&apos;t used to sharing his toys [when he started kindergarten], because it&apos;s only him at home. He has to get used to not always being the best,&quot; she noted. Li, who said such behaviour has been called Prince or Princess Syndrome, warned of other problems. &quot;Because children don&apos;t have playmates and siblings, they have to mature earlier and act like adults. We worry their childhood ends too early,&quot; he said. &quot;Also, where parents have only one child they focus all their energy and income. The child has to bear a lot of pressure.&quot; Faced with the personal and social costs, Taiwan&apos;s search for a solution is increasingly urgent. In the last two years the government has introduced subsidies for childcare, though critics say they are insufficient and that better quality care is needed. Mothers have also gained the right to return to work after up to three years off. Taipei, which has the lowest birthrate, has gone furthest. There are free tests to identify fertility problems; parental advisers; a &quot;baby bonus&quot; of 20,000 Taiwanese dollars (\u00a3430); and a childcare allowance for under-fives worth up to 150,000 dollars a child. To encourage marriage, the city organises matchmaking day trips for singles and free courses on handling relationships. It even subsidises companies to lay on dating activities for employees. Although the fertility rate appears to have rebounded in 2011 \u2013 with a 36% rise, officials said \u2013 it is hard to determine the long-term trend, because 2010 was particularly inauspicious for motherhood. Yang said births usually dropped sharply after dragon years, so that keeping up this year&apos;s momentum will be a challenge. He believes Taiwan must open its borders and encourage migration to stabilise its population. &quot;We are too late to start an incentives programme. If we don&apos;t do anything, it reaches a point of no return. If we do something, it will still be a problem that hangs over society for the next 20 to 30 years.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/24/smartphones-timeline", "publicationDate": "2012-01-24T20:00:00Z", "tags": ["Smartphones", "Apple", "Mobile phones", "Samsung", "Technology", "Google", "Android", "Software", "Microsoft", "Steve Ballmer", "Steve Jobs", "HTC", "Nokia", "BlackBerry corporation", "BlackBerry"], "sentences": ["Apple sues Taiwan&apos;s HTC over its touchscreen Android phone."], "title": "The history of smartphones: timeline", "article": "January 2007  Steve Jobs, chief executive of Apple, unveils the iPhone, which he says is &quot;a revolutionary and magical product that is literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone&quot;.

The fall in sales of handsets running Nokia&apos;s Symbian operating system, which the company is phasing out in favour of Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone software, has come harder and faster than the company originally anticipated. But investors took heart from chief executive Stephen Elop&apos;s forecast that the company would reverse a \u20ac954m loss in the fourth quarter of 2011 to reach break-even during the first quarter of 2012, and shares rose in morning trading. Sales of Nokia&apos;s Windows handsets, launched under the Lumia brand last October, have reached &quot;well over 1 million&quot;, the company confirmed.

Revenue from sales of Nokia smart devices fell 27% during 2011 to \u20ac10.8bn, although they rose 25% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. The company sold 19.6m smartphones in the Christmas quarter, up 2.8m on the third quarter. Mobile phone volumes were flat at 93.9m in the Christmas quarter. &quot;Overall, Nokia seems to be tiding over its difficult transition period between Symbian and Windows Phone without too much of downside,&quot; said analyst Janardan Menon at broker Liberum. &quot;We are optimistic about the longer term success of Nokia&apos;s Windows-based Lumia range.&quot; Nokia has cash reserves of \u20ac5.6bn, down from nearly \u20ac7bn last year, but its balance sheet improved during the fourth quarter by \u20ac515m, thanks in large part to a $250m support payment from Microsoft intended to help market the Windows phones."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/feb/01/top-10-video-games-shops-tokyo", "publicationDate": "2012-02-01T10:00:00Z", "tags": ["Tokyo holidays", "Japan holidays", "City breaks", "Top 10s", "Shopping trips", "Game culture", "Arcade games", "Games", "Asia", "Travel", "Technology", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Be aware that the &quot;Asian versions&quot; of Xbox 360 games (intended for South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore) are priced slightly lower than US imports."], "title": "10 of the best games shops in Tokyo", "article": "Super Potato Super Potato isn&apos;t really a shop, it&apos;s more like a video game museum where you can buy stuff.

In Akihabara, Sofmap has several locations, each with a slightly different focus: Akiba Sofmap #1 (computer games and popstars), Sofmap Amusement-kan (video games and posters ), and Akiba Sofmap #2 (figurines and used games). All three are worth visiting, although if you&apos;re travelling with kids, you might want to venture away from the idol and DVD sections.

Visitors might scoff at the high import prices, but Game Hollywood embodies the Japanese vision of what an American game shop looks like, complete with the Stars and Stripes over the doorway. It&apos;s located on the fifth floor, so keep an eye for a movie style logo surrounded by yellow lights. Not only is this an interesting location, it&apos;s also a good place for non-Japanese speakers to take a break from the aisles of aisles of indecipherable domestic games.

Secondhand games are a bargain here, too \u2013 in Japan, used games are often in pristine condition, as gamers buy them planning to finish them quickly and then sell them back at a high price.

He will take over from current CEO Howard Stringer in April, with Stringer assuming the role as chairman of the board of directors.  The move comes after weeks of speculation \u2013 and following a challenging business period for the consumer electronics veteran. The company is facing its fourth consecutive annual loss, and stock value has dropped by more than 50% since Stringer became the company&apos;s first non-Japanese CEO in 2005. The strong yen and the effects of last year&apos;s devestating earthquake have made for difficult business conditions, but Sony has also lost out to key rivals including Samsung in the television sector and Apple in computing and digital media.  &quot;The path we must take is clear,&quot; Hirai said in a statement. &quot;To drive the growth of our core electronics businesses \u2013 primarily digital imaging, smart mobile and game; to turn around the television business; and to accelerate the innovation that enables us to create new business domains. &quot;The foundations are now firmly in place for the new management team and me to fully leverage Sony&apos;s diverse electronics product portfolio, in conjunction with our rich entertainment assets and growing array of networked services, to engage with our customers around the world in new and exciting ways.&quot; If the future of Sony is about converged media platforms and digital services, Hirai would seem to have the experience to turn things around. As head of the PlayStation business, he has overseen a period in which the PS3 console recovered from the dominance of the Nintendo Wii to reach a global installed user base of more than 60 million. The machine has also become a media hub offering on-demand music and video content from Sony services as well as various partnerships with other content providers. Hirai also navigated a major controversy last spring when hackers broke into the back-end servers of the PlayStation Network and attained the details of millions of customers. The television manufacturing business could well be the toughest nut to crack, though \u2013 it hasn&apos;t been profitable for more than seven years. Last year, Sony sold its stake in a joint LCD panel manufacturing venture to partner Samsung for \u00a3600m. Hirai may well decide that the future is about innovating in digital services rather than screen technology. With the rise of internet connected smart TVs, Sony could concentrate on developing interactive services, while outsourcing screen manufacture to countries such as Taiwan, where producton costs are lower. Meanwhile, in the mobile sector, Sony has spent \u00a3920m buying its handset partner Ericsson out of their decade-long deal. The idea is that it will now be able to react faster to the innovations of rivals like Apple. However, Sony&apos;s attempts to profit in the growing tablet market, with the launch of its Tablet S and Tablet P devices, have not been hugely successful: the devices failed to impress critics and the Tablet S was subject to a $100 (\u00a363) price cut in January. Sony, once a leader in consumer electronics innovation with its Walkman and PlayStation brands, has a lot of work to do to figure out its place in a rapidly evolving market. Hirai, with experience in the expensive, dynamic and complex video games sector, may be best placed to oversee the transition."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/07/xi-jinping-china-washington-visit", "publicationDate": "2012-02-07T17:00:00Z", "tags": ["China", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Barack Obama", "Business"], "sentences": ["But as the Arab spring shows, a single event or a misstep by authoritarian rulers can transform apathetic middle-class citizens into radical revolutionaries \u2026 &quot;Today, China&apos;s middle class is becoming more dissatisfied with inequality, corruption, unaffordable housing, pollution and poor services \u2026 the party knows it cannot bank on middle-class support.&quot; Ironically, China&apos;s decision to allow uncensored coverage of January&apos;s Taiwan presidential poll, won by the pro-Beijing incumbent, may have backfired by sparking an impassioned mainland online debate about the advantages of democratic elections."], "title": "China's Mr Xi goes to wary Washington | Simon Tisdall", "article": "The portents surrounding the visit to Washington next week of vice-president Xi Jinping, the man expected to become China&apos;s new &quot;paramount leader&quot;, are not auspicious. The year of the dragon, just begun, may mark the moment when the aura of inevitability surrounding China&apos;s rise as leading global superpower is punctured, if not wholly dispelled. A range of factors, including adverse economic trends, internal challenges to Communist party control and increasing American re-assertiveness suggests an unexpectedly rough ride ahead for Beijing&apos;s would-be masters of the universe. The furious row over China&apos;s veto of the proposed UN resolution on Syria is a taste of things to come. Barack Obama&apos;s state of the union address vividly illustrated the more combative mood in the US towards a China that is daily accused by Republican presidential candidates of wilfully undermining American jobs and businesses and scheming to supplant the US as world No\u202f1. &quot;I will not stand by when our competitors don&apos;t play by the rules. We&apos;ve brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration \u2013 and it&apos;s made a difference,&quot; Obama said to applause. &quot;But we need to do more. It&apos;s not right when another country lets our movies, music and software be pirated. It&apos;s not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg-up on ours only because they&apos;re heavily subsidised.&quot; Obama said he would create a trade enforcement unit specifically tasked with investigating unfair Chinese trade practices. Falling demand in the US and recession-hit Europe has already had a seriously dampening effect on China&apos;s export-led economy and, despite a recent uptick in US performance, the outlook remains deeply uncertain. Analysts often suggest China&apos;s massive foreign exchange reserves give it a huge potential cushion. It owns about $2tn (\u00a31.25tn) in US treasury and mortgage-backed debt and $800bn in European bonds. But these holdings are a double-edged sword, as Minxin Pei, author of China&apos;s Trapped Transition: the Limits of Developmental Autocracy, noted. &quot;If China threatens to reduce its investment in US debt, it will either have to find alternative investments (not an easy task these days) or export less to the US (not a good idea for Chinese manufacturers). &quot;With so much invested in western debt, China would suffer disastrous capital losses if it spooked financial markets,&quot; Minxin wrote. This year is one of significant political transition in China as well as the US, with President Hu Jintao expected to step down early next year \u2013 and signs of Communist party nervousness abound. The latest in a series of trials of dissidents charged with subversion took place in Hangzhou, eastern China. Veteran rights activist Zhu Yufu was accused of undermining state power by sending a poem and messages on Skype. Such proceedings appear designed to pre-empt any political challenges as the Communist party changes guard. Likewise, police forces in the restive western Xinjiang region, the scene of repeated violent ethnic strife involving the local Muslim population, are to be boosted by several thousand this year. A renewed crackdown on Tibetan activists has been underway for some time. More mainstream challenges to Communist party hegemony stemming from China&apos;s 300 million-strong middle class may be brewing, Minxin suggested. &quot;At most, the Chinese middle class tolerates the status quo because it is a vast improvement over the totalitarian rule of the past, and because there is no practical or immediate alternative. But as the Arab spring shows, a single event or a misstep by authoritarian rulers can transform apathetic middle-class citizens into radical revolutionaries \u2026 &quot;Today, China&apos;s middle class is becoming more dissatisfied with inequality, corruption, unaffordable housing, pollution and poor services \u2026 the party knows it cannot bank on middle-class support.&quot; Ironically, China&apos;s decision to allow uncensored coverage of January&apos;s Taiwan presidential poll, won by the pro-Beijing incumbent, may have backfired by sparking an impassioned mainland online debate about the advantages of democratic elections. This highlighted another uncomfortable reality for the Chinese leadership: more than 500 million Chinese have access to the internet and technologically evolving social media. Government controls cannot keep up and censorship is said to be increasingly ineffective. Xi may have obliquely reflected ruling clique concerns about negative internal and external trends in a recent, remarkably conciliatory speech ahead of his meeting with Obama. &quot;No matter what changes affect the international situation, our commitment to developing the Sino-US co-operative partnership should never waver in the face of passing developments,&quot; Xi said. &quot;In dealing with major and sensitive issues that concern each side&apos;s core interests, we must certainly abide by a spirit of mutual respect and handle them prudently, and by no means can we let relations again suffer major interference and ructions.&quot; But the US is piling geopolitical on top of economic pressure: by exploring new or expanded military partnerships with the Philippines, Japan, Australia and Singapore; by reviving ties with Burma, China&apos;s long-time satellite; and by pressing for more responsible Chinese policy on North Korea, Syria and Iran. All this is part of what Obama calls a &quot;strategic shift&quot; to the Asia-Pacific region after a decade of Middle Eastern preoccupations. What the Chinese military sees is a blatant attempt to encircle and contain China. &quot;We&apos;ve made it clear that America is a Pacific power \u2026 America is back. Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn&apos;t know what they are talking about,&quot; Obama said. This is fighting talk. Obama, his heart set on a second term, has thrown down the gauntlet to China, which (Iran notwithstanding) is in danger of becoming the new US bogeyman. This is the backdrop to Xi&apos;s uncertain inheritance. Despite his conciliatory words, his Washington debut could produce fireworks."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2012/feb/10/cable-wireless-panama-problems", "publicationDate": "2012-02-10T09:22:16Z", "tags": ["Business", "Cable & Wireless Communications", "Icap", "Schroders", "Aviva", "Tullett Prebon", "Barclays"], "sentences": ["Aviva is down 5.8p to 364.2p on reports the insurer has postponed a potential sale of its stake in its loss-making Taiwan joint venture, because of regulatory disapproval."], "title": "Cable & Wireless Communications drops 7.5% on Panama problems", "article": "Shares in Cable &amp; Wireless Communications have lost 7.5% after a disappointing trading update. The company said since September it had seen a strong performance in Macau and the Bahamas, both of which were expected to beat expectations for the full year. Its Caribbean and Monaco businesses were trading in line, but Panama is proving a problem and is not expected to meet its targets. Increased competition, the effects of mobile number portability and margin pressure among its business customers, would hit earnings from Panama in the fourth quarter, the company said. It is now forecasting full year earnings from the country of around $254m, down on the $270m-$295m it has previously been anticipating. The news has sent its shares down 3.34p to 40.23p. On the positive side, its $1bn refinancing in the summer plus a $400m bond issue should see the company through to 2016. In a sell note Rory Stokes at Liberum Capital said:  The statement is a mixed bag. Ahead in Macau and Bahamas, but at lower end of expectations in Caribbean and about $25m miss for the year now expected in Panama. Statement implies EBITDA of around $865m for the year ended March 2012 compared to Liberum of $849m and consensus on $894m. Refinancing has bought breathing space but the very low cash generation of this business and the structural pressures it faces makes the net debt position look daunting and the dividend precarious.

A year ago exactly the John Lewis pension fund sold its remaining 10.4% stake for 265p a share, raising \u00a3152m. Inmarsat lost 11.5p to 458.6p after climbing sharply earlier in the week on bid speculation. Traders suggested the satellite operator could be a target for GE, EADS or private equity. Life insurer Phoenix fell 8o.5p to 561p after calling off takeover talks. The company, a closed life fund specialist formerly known as Pearl, pulled out of discussions with private equity group CVC because it could not agree on price. It said it was not in talks with any other parties, and so was no longer in an offer period. Phoenix had been in talks with CVC since November, after the failure of an approach from larger rival Resolution. Phoenix chief executive Clive Bannister said:  The terms proposed by CVC did not reflect our view of the full value of Phoenix and its stable, long-term cash flows. As a result we have mutually decided to terminate these discussions.   Analyst Marcus Barnard at Oriel Securities said:  Phoenix announced on 20 November that the board had held discussions with Resolution, but that these had been terminated. There has been some speculation that Resolution might come back to the table. While we cannot rule this out in the medium to long term, for the time being this seems unlikely.  Finally 888, which earlier in the week reported its highest ever quarterly revenues, was steady at 55.75p despite being one of ten online gaming businesses put on a draft list of companies which could be excluded from operating in Belgium. Analysts at Daniel Stewart said:  On the face of it, it appears to be bad news for 888; however we don&apos;t envisage Belgium as a particularly large gambling market.

What countries such as South Korea, Taiwan and China understood was that getting macro-policy and industrial policy right was vital but still only half the story."], "title": "We have to own up on the UK economy \u2013 we are not a big club anymore | Larry Elliott", "article": "The English football league was founded in 1888, a time when Britain still clung on to its position as the world&apos;s industrial powerhouse, and founder members reflected the fact that the economy&apos;s centre of gravity was north of a line drawn from the Severn estuary to the Wash. For a football fan, what&apos;s striking about the original dozen clubs \u2013 Accrington Stanley [see footnote], Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Burnley, Derby County, Everton, Notts County, Preston North End, Stoke City, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers \u2013 is that not one of them would be counted as a member of today&apos;s elite. Three are midtable in the Premier League, four are battling against relegation and five are plying their trade in the lower divisions. The downwardly mobile state of some of these grand old clubs has been mirrored by the UK&apos;s slide down the economic league table. What&apos;s more, there are striking parallels between the England team and the national economy: the complacency bred of inventing the game in the first place, the failure to adapt, the many false dawns, the way imported talent has shown up the deficiencies of the domestic workforce and, above all, the belief that with one or two tweaks (step forward Harry Redknapp) all will be well again. If it is hard to put a precise date on the moment when the UK economy peaked, there is no such difficulty picking the zenith of English football: the moment shortly before 5.30 on a Saturday afternoon in July 1966 when Geoff Hurst&apos;s shot thumped into the net at Wembley gave England a 4-2 victory over West Germany in the World Cup final. Ever since, it has been a story of profound underachievement as other countries have exposed the limitations of the country that gave the world the beautiful game. At first, only traditional rivals put England in the shade: Germany, Brazil, Argentina. More recently, though, the national team has struggled to cope with the challenge from the game&apos;s lesser lights, drawing with Algeria and the United States in the group stages of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa before being thrashed 4-1 by the Germans in the first knockout round. There was plenty of soul-searching when the lavishly paid England &quot;stars&quot; flew home in humiliation. In the past, excuses for World Cup failure had been that the hot weather sapped the players&apos; strength; that they were not used to games at high altitude; that they had been missing key players; that British coaches were light years behind their continental counterparts; or that they had been robbed by bad luck or by cheating foreigners. None of the familiar get-outs applied to a tournament played in South Africa in winter when a full-strength England was beaten by a demonstrably superior German team. The side was even managed by an Italian, the Football Association having come to the conclusion that if Japanese management could breathe new life into the car industry, Fabio Capello could do the same for 11 men kicking a ball around on a large lawn. He couldn&apos;t. Now let&apos;s look at the economy. Initially, the challenge came from the United States and Germany, but after the second world war the UK was also eclipsed in terms of growth rates and living standards by France, Italy and the Scandinavian nations. More recently, the threat has come from the bigger emerging economies of India and China. Warning signs of imminent decline have too often been ignored and even when they have been heeded, wrong lessons have been learned. Excuses (poor management, stroppy trade unions, too much or too little Europe, too great an appetite for grandiose projects, a snobbish approach to &quot;trade&quot;) have been trotted out. All sorts of remedies have been tried in an attempt to bring back the glory days and all, sooner or later, have failed. So let&apos;s try a thought experiment. Imagine there was the economic equivalent of an Alex Ferguson, an Ars\u00e8ne Wenger or a Redknapp who could be brought in to take control at UK FC. What would he say? Firstly, it would be clear that the economy has been far too dependent for far too long on one or two stars \u2013 the City and the housing market \u2013 that are in decline. Successful economies, like successful football teams, have a strong central core, and are well balanced between manufacturing and services and good at developing talent. This is much harder to achieve than it looks. It is not just a question of spending money nor of assuming that simply clobbering the City will lead to a thriving manufacturing base. As Simon Tilford of the Centre for European Reform has noted, as a share of its economy Italy&apos;s manufacturing sector is as big as Germany&apos;s, while France&apos;s industrial base is as small as Britain&apos;s. Rebalancing the economy is going to involve more than simply depreciating the currency or offering infant industry protection of the sort afforded by the emerging Asian economies, since that assumes there is enough there to protect. As things stand, there isn&apos;t. What countries such as South Korea, Taiwan and China understood was that getting macro-policy and industrial policy right was vital but still only half the story. In addition, there was intensive investment in education and training over many decades, which is now reflected in the international league tables produced by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The latest Programme for International Student Assessment in 2010 showed the UK in 25th place for reading, 28th place for maths and 16th place for science: mid-table and falling. As with football, the reality is that other nations are now a lot more skilful than we are, and there is plenty of work to be done on the training ground. The mantra should be that we have to brain up to build up. But first we have to own up. Perhaps the most important job for a new manager would be to tell the team he has inherited that it is not nearly as good as it thinks it is. Britain has not challenged for the world economy&apos;s Premiership title for 100 years, but for most of the past century we have comforted ourselves that we are a big club with a proud tradition, and that with a couple of new signings could once again give the best a run for their money. Recent results suggest otherwise. The recession was brutal and the recovery has been weak. Living standards will not return to their 2003 level until 2016. There are over one million young people unemployed. There are no new sources of growth to replace financial and property speculation. The old industrial heartlands have been decimated. The Treasury is skint. Britain is not an Everton or an Aston Villa, comforting though that thought may be. The table does not lie: we are a Bolton or a Blackburn, holding on to our place in the Premier League by our fingertips. \u2022 This footnote was appended on 16 February 2012. To clarify: some of these clubs were known by different names in the past.

There was a certain vibe that only comes around when it&apos;s one of those big nights at the Garden, the kind of buzz you get before Ali fights Frazier, when Michael Jordan returns to New York after &apos;retirement&apos;, the Rangers play for the Stanley Cup, and Willis Reed comes out of the tunnel. Adding to a list of signature moments that define New York and its Most Famous Arena isn&apos;t taken lightly around here, but fans were talking like it belonged, and that&apos;s because the player that transformed an otherwise ordinary evening in February into a happening was proving that he belonged.  A week earlier, no one could have guessed that Friday night would become one of those nights, but then again, who would have expected that the basketball world would be taken over by Jeremy Lin, a 23-year-old Taiwanese-American point guard out of Harvard who was released twice, recently relegated to the NBA&apos;s Development League and slept on his brother&apos;s couch.  By the time Lin was set to face Los Angeles, he had led the slumping Knicks to three straight victories, posting the kind of numbers that had his former general managers publicly regretting their decision to release him. Still, those wins came against less prominent opponents, and now Lin and the Knicks were playing Kobe Bryant&apos;s Lakers in front of a national television audience that were wondering if the clock was about strike 12 on the &apos;unlikely&apos; phenom.  Less than half way through the first quarter Lin had answered all questions, pouring in nine of the Knicks first 13 points. Down the stretch in the fourth quarter, Lin&apos;s three-pointer put an authoritative stamp on the Knicks fourth consecutive victory. In between, his athletic, inclusive, pick-and-roll play brought teammates who had become used to a more exclusive offense, back into the fold. \u00a0His numbers: 38 points, (outscoring Bryant) and seven assists. Lin had totaled 109 points in his first four NBA starts, more than Allen Iverson, more than Shaquille O&apos;Neal, more than Michael Jordan, tops since the NBA and ABA merged in 1976, a stretch of play that can only be described as &quot;Linsanity.&quot;            .Jeremy Lin was a last throw of the dice for Knicks head coach Mike D&apos;Antoni. Carmelo Anthony and Amar&apos;e Stoudemire brought star power to Broadway but didn&apos;t bring championship level basketball. The Knicks were sinking deeper and deeper in the standings as Anthony&apos;s one-dimensional efforts came up short. Big-ticket items such as Tyson Chandler were underutilized, Stoudemire looked lost, and Landry Fields&apos; regression, one that began after Anthony arrived via blockbuster trade nearly one year ago, continued. The Knicks had no viable point guard to bring the team together and were pinning their hopes on veteran Baron Davis, who has been on the shelf all season recovering from a herniated disk in his back. With D&apos;Antoni on the hot seat, New York&apos;s press was wondering if Phil Jackson would return to where it all began.  Then Anthony went down with a groin injury and Stoudemire left the team following the unfortunate death of his older brother. The last time the dazzle-less duo were on the court, &apos;Linsanity&apos; was in its infancy, with Jeremy coming off the bench to score 25 vs. the Nets. The Knicks haven&apos;t lost since, and what&apos;s followed has exploded well beyond the game of basketball.  You can&apos;t call someone with a Harvard education, who hails from Palo Alto, California, where 50 percent of over 25 year olds have graduate degrees, a rags-to-riches story. However, lovers of underdogs, which, let&apos;s face it, is just about everybody, are out in force in support of Lin, a 6&apos;3&quot; guard whose back-story makes him seem much smaller. After all, how many Asian-American Ivy Leaguers are in the NBA right now tearing it up, reviving a franchise on life support out of absolutely nowhere? How many basketball players are getting shout-outs from the President of Taiwan? Answer? One. Jeremy Lin.  Let&apos;s ask another question. How or why did everybody miss Jeremy Lin? The NBA is a global league and has been for some time. If news comes in that a player in Equatorial Guinea has a nasty crossover move and can hit three&apos;s blindfolded, the scouts are on a Yak-40 bound for Malabo faster than you can say Mark Thatcher. Jeremy Lin wasn&apos;t in Equatorial Guinea, he was here, in the United States, playing Division One ball at Harvard, putting up solid numbers even torching UConn for 30 points. Why was he missed? He&apos;s not small, he&apos;s not weak, he&apos;s not slow, he can shoot, he can pass, he&apos;s a dynamic team player with good court vision. All the boxes were ticked. Was it because he was at an Ivy League school? Or, was it because he faced stereotypes being an Asian-American?  Meanwhile the enormous level of attention Lin is receiving, never mind the major minutes he&apos;s playing, must be taking its toll. On Saturday night the Knicks played their second game in two days in Minnesota. Lin hit a wall in the second half, lying his way into the game&apos;s final play, telling D&apos;Antoni that he wasn&apos;t tired. Driving the lane as time ran down, Lin was fouled and hit what proved to be the game winning free-throw. That was after he fed Steve Novak, a major benefactor of &quot;Linsanity&quot;, a pass that would turn into a game tying three-point play.  The Knicks have won five straight, and Lin&apos;s Knicks look like a team, not &quot;two stars and a bunch of guys.&quot; Landry Fields, who knew Lin from Northern California courts, tweeted &quot;Most fun I&apos;ve ever had playing ball. Plain and simple.&quot; Will that fun continue when Anthony and Stoudemire return? Has Melo bought in to what he&apos;s been watching from the bench? If so, those nights at the Garden can only get bigger."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/14/ipad-3-launch-7-march", "publicationDate": "2012-02-14T10:50:42Z", "tags": ["iPad", "Apple", "Computing", "Tablet computers", "Technology", "Technology sector", "Business", "Digital media", "Media", "UK news", "US news", "World news", "4G"], "sentences": ["Apple bought rights to the name from a Taiwan company affiliated with Proview but the mainland company says it still has rights to use the name in China."], "title": "iPad 3 'to launch on 7 March'", "article": "Apple will launch the third version of the iPad on Wednesday 7 March at an event in San Francisco, according to a number of reports online.

Authorities in one Chinese city have seized iPads from retailers. Shenzhen Proview Technology registered the iPad trademark in China in 2001. Apple bought rights to the name from a Taiwan company affiliated with Proview but the mainland company says it still has rights to use the name in China.

But since the presidential election on 14\u00a0January, plans to finish Nuclear Power Plant Four are back on the agenda. The victorious Kuomintang party has committed itself to bringing the facility online by 2016, provided it meets safety requirements. The opposition Democratic Progressive party had promised that, if elected, it would halt the plant&apos;s commissioning. At present, almost one-fifth of the island&apos;s electricity comes from nuclear power. Taiwan&apos;s first three nuclear facilities were turnkey projects subcontracted to General Electric and Westinghouse, the leading US companies in this business. But the NPP-4 is the result of a laborious process supervised by Taipower, the public electricity utility. &quot;Taipower had no previous experience of nuclear power stations before taking charge of the NPP-4,&quot; says Aiya Hsu, of the Green Citizens&apos; Action Alliance. The scheme has been interrupted and restarted several times for technical and political reasons. &quot;The longer the project went on, the more it cost and the more cost-cutting there was,&quot; says a Taipower employee. The list of defects on this unfinished construction job is long. Two senior executives resigned in late 2011 to highlight their concerns. According to opposition MP Tien Chiu-chin, Taipower calculated in 2000 that it would cost NT$80bn ($2.6bn). &quot;Now it will end up costing four times as much. It has not even been commissioned yet it is already rated as one of the world&apos;s most dangerous plants by the World Nuclear Association,&quot; she adds. What poses the most immediate nuclear risk in Taiwan, however, is its the haphazard handling of radioactive waste. Since the first nuclear reactor started operating 34 years ago the authorities have been storing the waste in situ. Due to its complex political predicament, deprived of a seat in the UN and not officially recognised as a legitimate state, the Republic of China cannot have its spent fuel reprocessed abroad. Neither Beijing or Washington wish to see Taiwan recover plutonium \u2013 that could be used for military ends from reprocessed waste. So the three existing power stations are packed with highly radioactive waste, which in the event of an accident could pose a serious hazard. The six reactors&apos; cooling ponds now contain almost four times the amount originally planned. In the mid-1990s Framatome, the French nuclear conglomerate, now Areva, doubled the capacity of the storage racks at the Maanshan plant. But scientists remain concerned about the exceptional waste concentration at the facilities. According to Chiu Syh-tsong, head of AEC&apos;s fuel cycle department, the first ponds will reach capacity in 2014. He thinks that the priority should be to speed up the\u00a0construction of an onsite dry storage facility. Some of the ponds have already caused concern. In June 2010 the Taipei Times published an account by the head of Midco Diving and Marine Services, a US firm contracted to clean up the ponds at NPP-1. One of the ponds was allegedly a tip, and the divers removed ordinary rubbish, including diving gear, bottles, cables and other detritus. As for low-level radioactive waste, the &quot;interim&quot; repository, built on Orchid Island in the early 1980s, has been full for the past five years, according to Professor Peter Chang, head of the Radiation Protection Association. In 1999 the organisation revealed the presence of caesium-137 in neighbouring sweet potato fields and taro paddy fields, suggesting leakage. The government says that it has now identified suitable land to accommodate surplus waste, but not a single municipality is prepared to accept such a facility. Taipei is also thought to be negotiating with several other countries to take its waste. But the cost would be high and there is no sign of a successful outcome.

But the red carpet is being rolled out for China&apos;s Xi Jinping, this week. He is getting to have talks not only with the US president and vice-president, but also with the secretaries of the State and Defense departments, as well as the speaker of the House of Representatives. Nor he will he be subjected to the trying experience of a press conference; and protesters over Tibet and human rights are likely to be kept well away.  Since Xi is set to assume his country&apos;s top job of secretary of the Communist party in October, and then become state president in March 2013, this treatment is only fitting. As the eurozone&apos;s quest for funding from Beijing to help it out of its hole continued at Tuesday&apos;s EU-China summit in Beijing, it is also the latest sign of just how heavily China weighs in the global scales. The subjects for discussion in Washington are evident. Xi and his hosts will doubtless review the state of the world and the global economy. They will disagree on Syria and express frustration over North Korea. Obama will urge the Chinese to take steps to reduce the US trade deficit with the mainland. Given the persecution of lawyers and the self-immolations of Tibetan monks and nuns, human rights may be a little more than the usual pro-forma &quot;agreement to disagree&quot;. Obama has been groping for a relationship with Beijing since his visit to China in 2009 (he stayed away on his latest Asian tour). On that trip, he was widely seen as having been railroaded by his hosts. Hillary Clinton sounded a tougher line last year, but Vice-President Joe Biden was all smiles when he went to the mainland in 2011, with Xi shepherding him around. And Biden has now reportedly been put in charge of China policy. Sino-US strategic committees meet repeatedly, but little of substance changes.  In part, this is because, aside from defending its &quot;core interests&quot; of Tibet, Xinjiang, Taiwan and the Communist party-led politico-economy system, China&apos;s diplomacy often seems to amount to little more than the pursuit of raw material supplies to feed its economic machine. It is correspondingly difficult to engage with. But the vacuum is also because, like Europe, the United States appears to have little clear notion of how to deal with the big new kid on the block. China&apos;s explosive growth in the last three decades has led to straight-line forecasts that the People &apos;s Republic is set to rule the world. This is not going to happen, if only because the political leadership in Beijing, which is used to having its way, does not want it to happen. That said, the emergence of the world&apos;s most populous nation from the ruins of the late Mao period faces other powers with a situation never experienced before. A country that is still relatively poor now houses the world&apos;s second biggest economy, with foreign exchange reserves of more than $3tn, making it a major contributor to paying for the federal deficit of the richest country on earth. America wants to engage with China, but it also wants to hedge its bets in case things turn sour. So, Obama launched an initiative last year to buttress the US position in the Pacific, which brings it into potential confrontation with Beijing \u2013 the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) being pushed by Washington would not include the People&apos;s Republic. (Since it may well not extend to Japan or South Korea either, it is, in fact, probably dead in the water.) The naval build-up by the People&apos;s Liberation Army arouses fears among some commentators \u2013 and anxious warnings from the arms industry \u2013 that China will come to resemble pre-first world war Germany, even though its military capacity is far, far below that of the US.  China, for its part, knows that its growth has drawn heavily on the appetite in the west for its cheap goods and that it has no interest in trade wars with the US. In an allusion to commercial tensions, Xi told former senior US officials, including Henry Kissinger, at his first meeting in Washington:  &quot;This year marks the election year of the United States. I believe no one of insight from the US side would like to see that the election factors would have a regrettable impact on the development of ties between the two countries \u2026 We should deal with friction and differences in bilateral economic and trade cooperation in the spirit of seeking mutual benefits and win-win results through a positive and constructive way.&quot;  But old, protective suspicions regularly emerge from Beijing, augmented by rising nationalism on the back of economic growth. Hu Jintao, the man who will hand over to Xi, told a Communist party plenum last October:  &quot;We must clearly see that international hostile forces are intensifying the strategic plot of Westernizing and dividing China \u2026 We should deeply understand the seriousness and complexity of the ideological struggle, always sound the alarms and remain vigilant and take forceful measures to be on guard and respond.&quot;  In this uncertain context, Xi is, himself, a source of uncertainty. Son of a Mao-era vice-premier, who was purged during the Cultural Revolution and then rehabilitated to supervise the economic development of Guangdong province, Xi has worked his way up the bureaucracy of the state and party, and was elevated to the supreme decision-making body, the standing committee, of the politburo in 2007. Ask people in Beijing how he got to the top and the answer is that all the many interest groups in China are comfortable with him. He has been careful not to express any opinion that deviates from party orthodoxy. So, on current showing, Xi does not seem to be the leader who will be ready, or able, to undertake the structural reforms China needs in the coming years. He will have to deal with a society that is evolving beyond the constraints of the party state system \u2013 and with new tensions, as demonstrated by the ongoing imbroglio around the rock star of Chinese politics, Bo Xilai, in the mega-municipality of Chongqing. China has enormous problems, ranging from the environment to the legal system, through corruption and a lack of trust in authority of all kinds. Those domestic challenges, rather than foreign relations, will be the key to China&apos;s development, as it tries to move away from the old growth model. The world will have to reconcile itself to sitting on the sidelines and watching as the story is played out in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Chongqing and a hundred other places far from the White House."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/feb/15/inside-guardian-weekly-17-february", "publicationDate": "2012-02-15T14:14:56Z", "tags": [], "sentences": ["We take a (rather frightening) look at the Taiwanese nuclear energy programme, and at how Bulgaria became the second nation after France (rather surprisingly) to ban fracking."], "title": "Inside the 17 February edition", "article": "&quot;Behind the scenes&quot; might be described as the theme of this week&apos;s edition.

Android was the biggest smartphone OS by share throughout 2011 \u2013 marking a conquest by the software for which the first handset only appeared at the end of 2008. But the figure marked a slight sequential fall from Android&apos;s third-quarter share, when it hit 52.5% \u2013 a fall apparently due to Apple&apos;s introduction in October of the iPhone 4S together with reduced pricing on older iPhones. That saw Apple&apos;s share jump from 15% in the third quarter to 23.8% for the fourth quarter, the largest rise among any platform. Apple also became the biggest smartphone vendor for the quarter and for the year, the research group Gartner said. Overall, it was the third-largest mobile phone vendor in the world, behind the Finnish company Nokia, which narrowly kept its lead over Samsung, from South Korea.     Smartphone share from 1Q 2007 to 4Q 2011. Android has led for four quarters; Apple became the biggest single vendor. Source: Gartner.    There was some light for Nokia in the smartphone end: while shipments of its Symbian devices almost halved to 17m during the quarter, Gartner says that it shifted 1.3m Lumia 800 phones, confirming Nokia chief executive Stephen Elop&apos;s remark that it had established a beachhead in the market.  Nokia has adopted Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone as its future smartphone platform, and the figures from Gartner suggest that it is already the largest supplier. Samsung and HTC, which also make Windows Phone devices, together sold a total of 1.4m.     Smartphone share from 1Q 2007 to 4Q 2011, normalised to 100%. Android had a nip taken out of it by Apple in the fourth quarter. Source: Gartner, the Guardian    The new figures, published on Wednesday by Gartner, indicate that the fast-rising Android tide is not lifting all boats. Sony Ericsson, Motorola Mobility, LG Electronics and HTC all saw their share of the Android smartphone market eroded as Samsung took over the top end, and new entrants including China&apos;s Huawei and ZTE moved into the low end. For the fourth quarter, ZTE and Huawei were the fastest-growing vendors after Apple: &quot;[They] expanded their market reach and kept on improving the user experience of their Android devices,&quot; said Roberta Cozza, smartphone analyst at Gartner. HTC, MMI, LG and Sony Ericsson are being squeezed between Samsung at the high end and ZTE and Huawei at the low end, said Cozza. Overall, the smartphone market grew by 47% in the fourth quarter, and by 59% over the year, from 297m in 2010 to 472m in 2011. Android shipments were 219m for the year, or 46% of the smartphone total.  Smartphones comprised 31% of overall mobile sales in the fourth quarter, up from 22% in the same period in 2010 and 12.3% at the end of 2008, when the first Android phones went on sale.  The total world market for smartphones hit 472m in 2011, up from 297m in 2010. Worsening midrange Android outlook Aaron Jeny, smartphones analyst at brokers Nomura Securities, forecast that the problems of the mid-range companies \u2013 notably Taiwan&apos;s HTC \u2013 will worsen as cheaper Android smartphones from Chinese rivals make progress in the US and other markets. &quot;Over the past two months, we have seen an accelerating trend for smartphone commoditisation and low-margin requirements by competitors that we believe will structurally hurt HTC,&quot; Jeng noted. &quot;We still like HTC&apos;s brand value and strong attempt to innovate but think its valuation may retreat to a trough level in the product commoditisation process.&quot; Apple, Samsung and who? Tavis McCourt, an analyst at the stockbroker Morgan Keegan, suggested in a note to clients that: &quot;The [fourth quarter] data seems to suggest Apple is close to a checkmate on the rest of the industry, which is quickly losing its profit pool necessary to keep up with Apple&apos;s R&amp;D engine.&quot;  McCourt also warns that there are signs that the overall handset market could fall during the current quarter \u2013 something which normally only happens during a recession. Both Apple and HTC are expected to show smaller sales in the current period. His analysis suggests that while the industry&apos;s profit margins hit 21.8% overall \u2013 &quot;the highest on record based on our data&quot; \u2013 Apple took a huge chunk of it: &quot;Ex-Apple, margins were 8.0%, the weakest Q4 since 2008, and alarmingly down sequentially in what is normally a seasonally strong quarter,&quot; McCourt wrote. He suggested that shipment growth slowed in line with weaker demand in China and the emerging markets, clearly reflecting weakening global economic growth. He calculates that Apple accounted for nearly 50% of handset revenues \u2013 the company reported that the iPhone brought in $24.4bn (\u00a315.2bn) \u2013 and more than 80% of the industry&apos;s profits. &quot;Profit trends outside of Apple and Samsung were exceptionally weak, and many of these vendors face a &apos;make of break&apos; year in 2012,&quot; McCourt warns. &quot;Profits appear to be shrinking everywhere (except Samsung) and the rising tide of smartphones no longer appears to be lifting all boats\u2026 outside of Samsung, it&apos;s getting increasingly hard to understand where the rest of the competitors will get the research and development dollars to compete longer-term, given their shrinking profitability. &quot;Perhaps Microsoft and Google have the answer.&quot; RIM slips For RIM, Gartner&apos;s figures offered little comfort. Its shipments fell year-on-year from 14.7m to 13.2m, and it slipped from fifth-largest phone supplier overall in in the fourth quarter of 2010 to seventh, overtaken by ZTE and Huawei.  Cozza could find little comfort for it: &quot;RIM&apos;s delay with its BlackBerry 10 platform&quot; \u2013 which the company says will not arrive until later this year \u2013 &quot;will further impair its ability to retain users,&quot; Cozza noted. &quot;However, RIM&apos;s biggest challenge is still to expand the developer base around its ecosystem and convince developers to work and innovate with BlackBerry 10.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/15/jeremy-lin-knicks-asian-american", "publicationDate": "2012-02-15T18:30:01Z", "tags": ["US sports", "Sport", "Race issues", "New York", "US news", "World news", "Jeremy Lin", "Basketball"], "sentences": ["But for Asian America, Lin is a stratospheric star because he is Taiwanese-American: one of their own."], "title": "Jeremy Lin is not just a Knicks hero \u2013 he's an Asian-American superhero | Thea Lim", "article": "You don&apos;t need to be basketball fan to appreciate Jeremy Lin. Of course, that would be a good place to start. The 23-year-old New York Knicks player has led his team in a six-game winning streak, averaging about 26.8 points per game, and he turned Tuesday night into VaLINtine&apos;s Day when he scored a three-point shot with only five seconds left on the clock. But you could also just like him because he is a classic underdog. Lin was cut by two other NBA teams only two months ago; in New York he&apos;d been sleeping on his brother&apos;s couch and on 4 February his coach played him in a key position only out of desperation \u2013 other star players were absent. Lin scored 25 points that night (for all you non-basketball fans out there, that is a lot), which seemed like a fluke. Then Lin went on to score 28, 23, 38, 20 and 27 points in the next five games. You could just like Lin from a merely human point of view: sports fan or not, his replays are things of beauty. But for Asian America, Lin is a stratospheric star because he is Taiwanese-American: one of their own. Sports in general are deeply racially coded. Both Tiger Woods&apos;s rise and fall were recorded with racialised commentary that was often cringe-worthy. When he was still playing college basketball for Harvard, Lin himself said in 2008: &quot;I hear everything: &apos;Go back to China. Orchestra is on the other side of campus. Open up your eyes&apos; \u2026 I&apos;m an easy target because I&apos;m Asian. Sometimes it makes me uncomfortable, but it&apos;s part of the game.&quot; From Jack Johnson, Jackie Robinson and Yao Ming, athletes who stand out because of their ethnicity become inadvertent racial litmus tests: cultural reactions to them reveal a cross-section of attitudes around race and racism, at any given point in time. At the turn of the last century, white boxing champions refused to fight black boxer Jack Johnson until 1910. When Jackson finally fought and beat the white champion, a spate of lynchings broke out. The good news is that things have improved vastly since Jackson&apos;s time \u2013 though we haven&apos;t hit that shadowy post-racial era yet, as evidenced by Twitter, that other cross-section of racial progress. On Monday, undefeated boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr tweeted: &quot;Jeremy Lin is a good player but all the hype is because he&apos;s Asian. Black players do what he does every night and don&apos;t get the same praise.&quot; On Friday, sportswriter Jason Whitlock took to Twitter to speculate on the size of Lin&apos;s penis \u2013 invoking a long and ugly history of jokes that take Asian men&apos;s sexuality as their punchline. Spike Lee, who might be Lin&apos;s biggest celebrity fan, has been using Twitter to find nicknames for Lin. In response to possible contenders like &quot;CHING-A-LIN CHING-A-LIN,&quot; the ever-eloquent Lee said: &quot;NO. NO. NO.&quot; When I wrote about Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao last year (himself a victim of rival Mayweather&apos;s anti-Asian sentiment), I argued that, like Lin, Pacquiao is significant not just as an athletic supernova but as a real-life hero for Asian Americans seeking one. Rarely do Asians get to see themselves in starring roles on western television, or outside of a fictional lens that might poke fun at their heritage, their families or their sexuality. See Long Duk Dong, or The Hangover&apos;s Mr Chow, played by Ken Jeong for examples (though look to this video to see Ken Jeong redeem himself via his portrayal of Senor Chang, an Asian Spanish genius.) Lin is familiar and unfamiliar. He embodies Asian stereotypes while exploding them: Lin did very well in school, is close to his family, and he even has nerd pride. And he has scored more points in his first six starts than any player (including Shaq and Michael Jordan) since 1976. I appreciate him because he is a basketball star, because he is an underdog, and because right now, he seems sort of superhuman. But most of all I appreciate him for the looks of giddy, unadulterated joy on the faces of Asian-American fans in the stands, who are just so happy that he&apos;s finally arrived. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/15/malawi-africa-creeping-dictatorship", "publicationDate": "2012-02-15T19:01:54Z", "tags": ["Malawi", "Africa", "World news", "Governance", "Global development"], "sentences": ["2008 Malawi pledges allegiance to China after severing diplomatic relations with Taiwan."], "title": "Malawi: Africa's 'warm heart' feels chill of creeping dictatorship", "article": "&quot;Something terrible is about to happen to me,&quot; read the handwritten note. &quot;Am sorry I never explained anything when I came last time \u2026 Am sorry for the pain am about to cause. Have taken my life. Burn me up and give the ashes to Vivian.&quot; Robert Chasowa, a 25-year-old engineering student and political activist in Malawi, killed himself last September. His body was found in a pool of blood at a university campus after he jumped to his death from a five-storey building. That, at least, was the official version of events. But a postmortem examination suggested Chasowa had been struck on the back of the head with a blunt instrument. He also had four scratches on his back. There were other suspicious circumstances that have convinced many he was killed, and his suicide note \u2013 written in capital letters \u2013 was faked. Such conspiracies no longer seem as incredible as they once did in Malawi, a mild and modest country that bills itself &quot;the warm heart of Africa&quot;. Last year at least 18 people were killed by police when unprecedented anti-government protests turned violent, some shot in the back as they ran. Human rights defenders and journalists speak of beatings and persecution. A university lecturer who addressed the Egyptian revolution was arrested, detained and lost his job. New laws threaten to close newspapers and allow police to search homes without a warrant. In Malawi&apos;s small, green and sleepy capital, Lilongwe, menace hangs in the air. Meanwhile frustrations are boiling over as the economy hits a wall after years of growth. Malawi&apos;s dominant export, tobacco, has been weakened by international efforts to cut smoking. The country has chronic shortages of foreign exchange, medicines and fuel, with drivers forced to abandon their cars overnight in queues at petrol stations. The government is defying calls by the IMF to devalue the national currency, the kwacha. Sitting in a cafe last week, Chasowa&apos;s father, Austin, pointed to an image on his mobile phone. &quot;That is the last day I saw Robert alive,&quot; he said. &quot;I look at this picture every day. Robert was a pillar of the family but now the pillar is gone. I don&apos;t know who&apos;ll be next. Everyone in the home keeps mourning and mourning.&quot; Austin, 55, who lost another son to an unresolved murder five years ago, is adamant that Robert was killed for political reasons. &quot;I&apos;ve seen the postmortem report,&quot; he said. &quot;It is not suicide. The truth is he was killed by politicians. The suicide note was faked \u2013 maybe they forced him into it.&quot; Malawi is a sliver of southern Africa with 15.4 million people, nearly three-quarters of whom live on less than $2 (\u00a31.26) a day. Life expectancy is 54.2 years. The country is ranked by the UN as one of the world&apos;s 20 least developed, one place better off than Afghanistan; there was no TV until 1999. It may be doomed to become another little noticed tragedy on the edge of the map of global consciousness. The president is Bingu wa Mutharika, 77, a former World Bank technocrat who, after coming to power in 2004, dumped his party and formed a new one. Still, Malawi was admired as a beacon of democracy and good governance and, in 2009, Bingu won re-election by a landslide. But then &quot;he completely changed, became a different person&quot;, according to Undule Mwakasungula, executive director of the Centre for Human Rights Rehabilitation (CHRR) and a one-time backer. &quot;Now he&apos;s arrogant and wants to fight everybody. He talks about reconciliation but attacks individuals. He&apos;s a pretender.&quot; For watchdogs such as the Open Society Initiative of Southern Africa (Osisa), many of the all-too-familiar warning signs are flashing red. &quot;The president has systematically concentrated almost all power in his own hands and has launched a concerted \u2013 and often chilling \u2013 campaign to silence any potential critics and to close Malawi&apos;s once vibrant democratic space in a blatantly anti-constitutional fashion,&quot; it says. Certainly there are echoes of Zimbabwe, from an economy in freefall to rumours of pro-regime youth militias and a toxic political climate. Bingu is using bellicose rhetoric reminiscent of his friend Robert Mugabe. He has taken swipes at western donors and the media and attacked civil society activists by name, threatening to &quot;smoke you out&quot;. At the opening of parliament this month, he warned of &quot;the machinations by some external forces that are encouraging our detractors to bring about chaos, lawlessness, disobedience so as to foster regime change in our country&quot;. Bingu was possibly referring to &quot;external forces&quot; such as the British high commissioner, Fergus Cochrane-Dyet, who accused him last year of &quot;becoming ever more autocratic and intolerant of criticism&quot; in a leaked diplomatic cable. Cochrane-Dyet was expelled and is yet to be replaced. The spat was a factor in a decision by Britain, Malawi&apos;s biggest bilateral donor at \u00a393m a year, to freeze direct budgetry support, though it continues to provide targeted aid. Bingu has new friends to turn to, however. Chinese contractors have built Malawi&apos;s parliament building, national conference centre, presidential villas, school and university buildings, the five-star Golden Peacock hotel and a 60-mile road, with the national stadium and agriculture technology centre to follow. The president has even taken to wearing Chinese collar suits, flouting parliament&apos;s dress code. When he controversially redesigned the national flag, importing thousands of the new version before anyone could object, the flags were, inevitably, made in China. In an interview on state TV last week \u2013 subtitled Malawi&apos;s Success Story \u2013 Bingu said: &quot;The Chinese government has given us aid absolutely with no strings attached, just as one friend to another. When you are in trouble is when you see who your real friends are \u2026 When the Chinese are telling you they are friends of Africa, you&apos;d better believe it. They are true friends of Africa.&quot; But his growing band of critics fear the suffocation of democracy and human rights. Benedicto Kondowe, executive director of the Civil Society Education Coalition, claims he was attacked at 1am by men with stones and metal bars who smashed his vehicle and hit him on the head, causing a gash. He then spent two months on the run. Kondowe, 38, said he and other civil society leaders had visited the president to plead their case, but were given short shrift. &quot;He told us we were stupid and said: &apos;If this was [Malawi&apos;s former leader] Hastings Banda&apos;s time, you could not leave this place alive.&apos; We stared at him because we did not think such a statement befitted his office.&quot; He added: &quot;We are slowly becoming a Zimbabwe. It might be worse than Zimbabwe. Recently the police used teargas to chase school children aged six to 12. &quot;The president is already a dictator. He wants to monopolise. He controls the agenda of the cabinet. He dictates the business of parliament. These are the critical elements of a typical tyrannical regime that we&apos;ve had in Africa.&quot; Another activist, the Rev MacDonald Sembereka, acting national co-ordinator of the Human Rights Consultative Committee, told how one of his homes was petrol bombed. &quot;They thought I would be in the house,&quot; the 43-year-old said. &quot;One would not rule out that they were trying to kill me. Someone called me anonymously and said: &apos;We will deal with you.&apos; I know there is no freedom without cost, but the cost of life is scary. My daughter is seven and couldn&apos;t sleep for two weeks. She said she heard people talking and was afraid they would torch this house as well. It&apos;s been the most shocking thing of my life.&quot; He warned: &quot;I think Malawi is currently at a crossroads when it comes to its reputation for human rights safeguards. There is a high level of intimidation and limiting of freedom and speech.&quot; The government is not taking the criticism lying down. It argues the July protests turned into rioting and looting, and defends the use of live ammunition by the police. It claims there are 550 NGOs in Malawi that lack transparency and, Bingu insists, are funded by &quot;foreign agents&quot;. Eruptions of public disorder remain unpredictable \u2013 last month street vendors beat and stripped women for wearing trousers. There is resentment over Bingu&apos;s reported extravagance, including $13.3m (\u00a38.5m) spent on a presidential jet and big sums spent on a mansion in his home district and a salary for his wife, Callista. At the same time, Malawi is suffering chronic shortages of foreign currency and fuel. The latter has seen pregnant women dying after ambulances became stranded. Power cuts are frequent, the courts are shut because of a strike and people are losing their jobs. This tinderbox of frustrations may only require a spark. &quot;I&apos;m shocked by the anger at the grass roots,&quot; said Chris Chisoni of the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. &quot;It just needs someone very clever to mobilise them and light a fire that can&apos;t be put out.&quot; Bingu is due to step down in 2014. Some suspect he will attempt to extend his term to 2016. Others believe he will hand over to his brother Peter, currently the foreign minister, who recently returned from sabbatical. Malawi remains a constitutional democracy with a feisty press, still publishing columns, cartoons and editorials calling for the president&apos;s resignation. But for how long? Edge Kanyongolo, a law professor at Malawi University, believes the July protests were a watershed moment for Malawi and all is not yet lost. &quot;The fundamental structures of democracy are in place and they have shown resistance,&quot; he said. &quot;We are not on the verge of collapse. But there has been regression over the past few years. There has been a centralising style of leadership and there is less tolerance. &quot;The economy has been through a rough patch. These factors have combined to put pressure on democracy. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s too far fetched that we will turn into another Zimbabwe.&quot; From invasion to independence 1st century AD Indigenous Twa and Fulani tribes invaded by Bantu tribes from the north 1480 Bantu form Maravi confederacy, containing modern Malawi and large parts of Mozambique and Zambia 17th century Portuguese explorers arrive via what is now Mozambique 1850 Scottish explorer David Livingstone opens way for European missionaries and traders 1891 Nyasaland and District Protectorate established.

Macroeconomic data from the United States improved; blue-chip companies in advanced economies remained highly profitable; China and emerging markets slowed only moderately; and the risk of a disorderly default and/or exit by some members of the eurozone declined. Moreover, under its new president, Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank appears willing to do anything necessary to reduce stress on the eurozone&apos;s banking system and governments, as well as to lower interest rates. Central banks in both advanced and emerging economies have provided massive injections of liquidity. Volatility is down, confidence is up and risk aversion is much lower \u2013 for now. But at least four downside risks are likely to materialise this year, undermining global growth and eventually negatively affecting investor confidence and market valuations of risky assets. First, the eurozone is in deep recession, especially in the periphery, but now also in the core economies, as the latest data shows an output contraction in Germany and France. The credit crunch in the banking system is becoming more severe as banks deleverage by selling assets and rationing credit, exacerbating the downturn. Meanwhile, not only is fiscal austerity pushing the eurozone periphery into economic freefall, but the loss of competitiveness there will persist as relief at the waning prospect of disorderly defaults strengthens the euro&apos;s value. To restore competitiveness and growth in these countries, the euro needs to fall towards parity with the US dollar. And, while the risk of a disorderly Greek collapse is now receding, it will re-emerge this year as political instability, civil unrest and more fiscal austerity turn the Greek recession into a depression. Second, there is now evidence of weakening performance in China and the rest of Asia. In China, the economic slowdown under way is unmistakable. Export growth is down sharply, turning negative vis-\u00e0-vis the eurozone&apos;s periphery. Import growth, a sign of future exports, has also fallen. Similarly, Chinese residential investment and commercial real-estate activity are slowing sharply as home prices start to fall. Infrastructure investment is down as well, with many high-speed railway projects on hold and local governments and special-purpose vehicles struggling to obtain financing amid tightening credit conditions and lower revenues from land sales. Elsewhere in Asia, Singapore&apos;s economy shrank for the second time in three quarters at the end of 2011. India&apos;s government predicts 6.9% annual GDP growth in 2012, which would be the lowest rate since 2009. Taiwan&apos;s economy fell into a technical recession in the fourth quarter of 2011. South Korea&apos;s economy grew at a mere 0.4% in the same period \u2013 the slowest pace in two years \u2013 while Japan&apos;s GDP contracted at a larger-than-expected 2.3%, as the yen&apos;s strength weighed down exports. Third, while US data has been surprisingly encouraging, America&apos;s growth momentum appears to be peaking. Fiscal tightening will escalate in 2012 and 2013, contributing to a slowdown, as will the expiration of tax benefits that boosted capital spending in 2011. Moreover, given continuing malaise in credit and housing markets, private consumption will remain subdued; indeed, two percentage points of the 2.8% expansion in the last quarter of 2011 reflected rising inventories rather than final sales. And, as for external demand, the generally strong dollar, together with the global and eurozone slowdown, will weaken US exports, while still-elevated oil prices will increase the energy import bill, further impeding growth. Finally, geopolitical risks in the Middle East are rising, owing to the possibility of an Israeli military response to Iran&apos;s nuclear ambitions. While the risk of armed conflict remains low, the current war of words is escalating, as is the covert war in which Israel and the US are engaged with Iran; and now Iran is lashing back with terrorist attacks against Israeli diplomats. The Islamic Republic, with its back to the wall as sanctions bite, could also react by sinking a few ships to block the Strait of Hormuz, or by unleashing its proxies in the region \u2013 the pro-Iranian Shia in Iraq, Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Moreover, there are broader geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that will not ease \u2013 and that might intensify. The Arab spring has produced a relatively favourable outcome in Tunisia, where it started, but developments in Egypt, Libya and Yemen remain far more uncertain, while Syria is on the brink of civil war. In addition, there are substantial concerns about political stability in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia&apos;s oil-rich eastern province, and potentially even in Kuwait and Jordan \u2013 all areas with substantial Shia or other restless populations. Beyond the countries affected by the Arab spring, rising tensions between Shia, Kurdish and Sunni factions in Iraq since the US withdrawal do not bode well for a boost in oil production. There is also the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, as well as strains between Israel and Turkey. In other words, there are many things that could go wrong in the Middle East, any combination of which might stoke fear in markets and lead to much higher oil prices. Despite weak economic growth in advanced economies and a slowdown in many emerging markets, oil is already at around $100 per barrel. But the fear premium could push it significantly higher, with predictably negative effects on the global economy. With so many risks in so many places, investors, not surprisingly, will eventually prize liquidity in their portfolios, while shunning riskier fixed assets again when these tail risks materialise. That is yet another reason to believe that the global economy remains far from achieving a balanced and sustainable recovery. \u00a9 Project Syndicate, 2012"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/19/courtney-love-breakfast", "publicationDate": "2012-02-19T00:08:01Z", "tags": ["Courtney Love", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Music"], "sentences": ["She began speaking about the Mexican food on location, then more enthusiastically about sushi she&apos;d devoured day and night while a stripper in Taiwan and the black puddings shared with her ex, the singer Julian Cope."], "title": "Breakfast with Courtney Love", "article": "Courtney Love remained in bed throughout my audience with her in a small hotel room in west London in 1987.

Thirty two senators from both parties introduced a resolution to rule out &quot;any policy that would rely on containment as an option in response to the Iranian nuclear threat&quot;. Closer to home, British foreign secretary William Hague echoed the logic. A nuclear Iran would spark off &quot;the most serious round of nuclear proliferation since nuclear weapons were invented&quot;. It would result in &quot;a new cold war in the Middle East&quot; lacking all the &quot;safety mechanisms&quot; of the US-Soviet rivalry. Comments like these reflect a growing nuclear alarmism that could drag us into an unwinnable and unnecessary war. A nuclear Iran is profoundly undesirable \u2013 but it&apos;s also eminently containable. The first argument, that Iran is too crazy to be deterred, is historically untenable. Stalin&apos;s Soviet Union was viewed in exactly the same terms. NSC-68, one of the most famous American intelligence assessments of the cold war, judged Moscow to be &quot;animated by a new fanatic faith, antithetical to our own&quot;, aimed at &quot;domination of the Eurasian landmass&quot;. That was the year after the Soviets&apos; first nuclear test. Mao Zedong, who was to acquire a bomb shortly thereafter, welcomed a nuclear war in which &quot;imperialism would be razed to the ground, and the whole world would become socialist&quot;. Senator Joseph Lieberman last week fumed that &quot;containment might have been viable for the Soviet Union during the cold war, but it&apos;s not going to work with the current fanatical Islamist regime in Tehran&quot;. Well, fanaticism has pedigree. Stalin and Mao might have been bloodthirsty fanatics, but they were not suicidal. Nor is Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Last week, two of America&apos;s top intelligence officials told a senate hearing two important things. First, any Iranian decision to build a nuclear weapon would be based &quot;on a cost-benefit analysis&quot;. Even fanatical theocracies are governed by reason. Second, &quot;Iran is unlikely to initiate or intentionally provoke a conflict&quot;. If Iran is deemed to be unlikely to start a conventional war, it&apos;s not going to start a nuclear war. And there&apos;s a simple reason for this. The area around Tehran contains a fifth of Iran&apos;s population, and half of the country&apos;s industry. A single Israeli thermonuclear bomb would wipe this out in the blink of an eye. Iran&apos;s abhorrent calls to wipe Israel off the map are gestures as empty as Mao&apos;s nuclear posturing. Even if Iran is not crazy enough to use a bomb, wouldn&apos;t it encourage brinksmanship in one of the most sensitive parts of the world? Hasn&apos;t Pakistan been emboldened by its own nuclear shield to ramp up support for militants in Afghanistan and India? One important distinction is that Pakistan hosts militants on its own soil, whereas Iran largely helps them &quot;off-site&quot;, in places like Lebanon and Palestine. India can&apos;t attack Lashkar-e-Taiba, responsible for the Mumbai attacks, without attacking Pakistan itself. Israel, by contrast, will continue to be able to strike at Hezbollah or Hamas regardless of Iran&apos;s nuclear status. The second argument concerns safety. The implication here is that a tinpot republic like Iran can&apos;t possibly be trusted to look after something so powerful. For a start, this misses the point that nuclear weapons are not like pregnancy \u2013 you can be a little bit nuclear. As James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, put it last month, Iran \u2013 much like Japan \u2013 is &quot;keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons&quot; rather than putting together a bomb and attaching it to a missile. If Tehran did put together a bomb, it might not be deployed. Iran, a large country with substantial conventional strength, has strategic depth. It can wait for threats to develop before, say, mating warheads to missiles. Apartheid-era South Africa, for instance, built a handful of nuclear weapons, kept them stored unassembled in a vault, and eventually dismantled them. India, for a decade after its first nuclear test, didn&apos;t even bother to prepare a bomb. When it eventually did, neither it nor Pakistan meaningfully deployed their weapons for another 10 years. The two countries have since defied William Hague&apos;s suggestion that emerging nuclear powers can&apos;t implement safety mechanisms. The third and final charge is that Iranian nuclear advances would set in motion a uncontrolled proliferation cascade as other regional powers scrambled for their own bombs. Yet history suggests that nukes don&apos;t inevitably beget nukes. A declassified American document from 1964, the year China went nuclear, identified over a dozen nations &quot;with the capacity to go nuclear&quot; \u2013 yet only a tiny fraction ever did. When the Soviets got the bomb, Yugoslavia or Sweden \u2013 both on that list of proliferating risks \u2013 did not follow. Taiwan did not follow China. South Korea and Japan did not follow North Korea. The obvious retort is that all of these states were allies or clients of the US \u2013 but so too are Iran&apos;s rivals today. There are technical and political challenges to bringing Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey under the American nuclear umbrella \u2013 but these are lesser problems when compared with the consequences of a military strike on Iran. The alarmist response to Iran&apos;s nuclear programme reflects a failure of imagination and ignorance of history. Iran has an obligation to the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations to explain the possible military dimensions of its nuclear programme. But if we \u2013 like the senators who sought to tie their president&apos;s hand last week \u2013 fool ourselves into thinking that a nuclear Iran cannot be contained, we increasingly back ourselves into a corner from which we will eventually be able to do little but lash out. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/24/cultural-revolution-portraits-xu-weixin", "publicationDate": "2012-02-24T16:38:00Z", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["I think, when he got to that point, really, he just closed up.&quot; Zhou came from a long line of landowners and scholars; his father, a\u00a0renowned paleontologist, had spent time in America and Taiwan."], "title": "China's Cultural Revolution: portraits of accuser and accused", "article": "No portrait is more important to Xu Weixin than his first. It was 1966; the artist was eight; and he had learned, to his shock, that his kindly young teacher was the daughter of a landlord \u2013 an enemy of the people. Outraged, he drew a hideous caricature and pinned it to the blackboard. When Miss Liu entered the classroom, &quot;She turned pale but didn&apos;t say a word,&quot; he said. She had good reason to be frightened. The Cultural Revolution was at its height, and across China teachers, former landlords and intellectuals were being humiliated, beaten and murdered. They were hounded by neighbours, colleagues and pupils moved by misguided revolutionary fervour, personal grudges or little more than whim. Friends, children and spouses turned on them. By the time the chaos subsided 10 years later, an estimated 36 million had been persecuted and at least 750,000 were dead in the countryside alone. Red Guards had smashed up temples, burned books and destroyed historical treasures. Universities had closed and pupils missed years of schooling. Even Communist party historians describe it as a disaster, unleashed by Mao Zedong. But their terse verdict is designed to pre-empt, rather than encourage, debate. An event that defines China to this day \u2013 that helps to explain its fixation with political stability; its dramatic economic reforms; even, some say, its increased individualism \u2013 remains largely taboo. Xu, now 53, is among the handful daring their country to confront its past. The faces of the Cultural Revolution are captured in the immense black-and-white portraits stacked in his Beijing studio. Each standing 2.5m tall, they are both personal and powerful, demanding attention. The monochrome oils are in stark contrast to the garish colours of 60s propaganda.           Some of Xu&apos;s subjects were victims, some perpetrators. Many were both. Mao is there, as is his infamous wife Jiang Qing; so are unknown scholars and Red Guards. It has taken the artist five years to complete this series of just over 100 paintings. But it is work he has been preparing for all his life. &quot;I feel they are related to that first portrait,&quot; Xu says. &quot;I feel guilty [about my teacher]; but it also helps me to understand\u2026 People who were close to you \u2013 who were friendly and kind \u2013 could suddenly turn upon you.&quot; The theory was that creative destruction would eradicate old habits and ideas, transforming a struggling country. More urgently, the disastrous Great Leap Forward and Khrushchev&apos;s fall in the Soviet Union impelled Mao to see off rivals and critics. His heir apparent Liu Shaoqi was one of many to die in disgrace. The violence shook every strata of society and rippled out to the farthest corners of the country. Teenagers and youths were encouraged to attack fellow citizens. More than one observer has compared the anarchy to Lord Of The Flies. &quot;It&apos;s very, very vivid,&quot; Xu says. &quot;I remember all the demonstrations and public denunciations; people breaking pictures and smashing Buddhas. At the beginning, people were using bricks or wooden rods and metal bars to hurt people. We could hear gunshots at night and people were beaten to death.&quot; His hometown in Xinjiiang was far from the worst affected. In Chongqing, rival factions battled with guns and tanks. In Guangxi, there are accounts of cannibalism. Victims were condemned as &quot;monsters and freaks&quot;; Xu&apos;s response is not to demonise their accusers, but to approach each subject with the same neutral gaze. &quot;Even if they are bad people, they are still people. I have to respect them,&quot; he says. As a child he, too, believed the Cultural Revolution was &quot;a great thing, a right thing, and something we must do&quot;. In retrospect, the movement was not just horrific but often ludicrous in its paranoia: the most &quot;sinister&quot; aspect of one supposed conspiracy, notes the book Mao&apos;s Last Revolution, was that even some of its core members appeared unaware of its existence. China&apos;s current leaders undoubtedly understand the damage; several of their parents suffered, even died. But a fuller reckoning of events \u2013 and Mao&apos;s role \u2013 would risk undermining the party&apos;s hold on power. &quot;In textbooks this long period of history is described with one sentence, and you can&apos;t discuss it,&quot; says Xu, who believes it has become harder to talk about over the last decade. Several of his portraits were exhibited in Beijing\u00a0a few years ago, but he does not expect another show on the mainland. He merely hopes more people will become aware of his work, and reflect on their own experiences. &quot;Most people think the\u00a0Cultural Revolution was the Gang of Four&apos;s fault, but actually everyone should be responsible.&quot; That includes the eight-year-old who scrawled his teacher&apos;s picture. That Miss Liu\u00a0survived the decade largely unscathed is some comfort, Xu says, but, &quot;Of course, I was responsible. It&apos;s only a question of how great or\u00a0small my responsibility was.&quot; Yu Xiangzhen, former Red Guard     Photograph: Dan Chung for the Guardian    Almost half a century on, it floods back: the hope, the zeal, the carefree autumn days riding the rails with fellow teenagers. And with it comes the shame, the fear and the blood clotted on a dying man gasping for\u00a0water. Yu Xiangzhen was an idealistic 14-year-old when the Cultural Revolution broke out, and among the first to form a Red Guards group. &quot;We were taught that Chairman Mao was closer to us than our parents \u2013 he was like a god to me,&quot; she says. From the first, she had doubts: when she saw fellow students berating and humiliating teachers, hacking off their hair and pouring glue over them; when she watched her peers assaulting &quot;capitalists&quot; and &quot;rightists&quot;. It felt wrong, and yet, &quot;I still thought it was right because everything I was hearing was that we needed to break the old\u00a0world to build a new one. &quot;I didn&apos;t think these people deserved to be beaten up....[But in refusing to take part] I felt I was, indeed, not brave enough. It was a\u00a0loss of face.&quot; Then, she says, came &quot;something so horrifying I will never be able to forget it as long as I live&quot;. There is no doubt she is still traumatised, and her voice rises to a shriek as she describes it. &quot;It was dark \u2013 I was standing by the side of a road, waiting for my friends. I heard someone whispering for water and saw a man crawling towards me from the basketball court,&quot; she says. &quot;He was covered in blood. The\u00a0blood on his head had congealed already. I\u00a0was terrified. Then I saw the court \u2013 it was almost covered by dead bodies.&quot; All, she believes, beaten to death by Red Guards. Yet, for these teenagers, it was a\u00a0heady as well as a frightening time. Hours after witnessing the atrocity, Yu was on a train to Shanghai. They\u00a0were travelling first to spread the cause \u2013 bearing leaflets titled &quot;Long live the red terror&quot; \u2013 but then &quot;it just became travel and leisure&quot;. Trains were free to Red Guards; food and lodgings awaited them. &quot;There were no plans, no destinations\u2026 I\u00a0was just very happy.&quot; Yu has begun to blog about her past in an attempt to understand it. &quot;I turn 60 very soon. There isn&apos;t much time left to think properly and write,&quot; she says. But she struggles to make sense of the violence, and few friends want to discuss it. &quot;The Red Guards who were most active had [political] problems in their family and tried to prove they were different,&quot; she suggests. &quot;Every time we get together, I look for the people who were most brutal. One told me it was exciting to go to people&apos;s houses and smash things and beat them up. You felt you could do whatever you wanted \u2013 that you were in control\u2026 And you thought it was the right thing to do.&quot; Carol Chow     Photograph: Dan Chung for the Guardian    Chow is a modern Chinese success story. She returned six years ago, from the States, lured back by the country&apos;s transformation. Her company sells cupcakes and confections to Beijing&apos;s elite. And yet there is a space in her life so profound that, &quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t know what it would even mean to have that gap be filled; I\u00a0would be another person.&quot; It was left by the handsome young man hanging on the wall of Xu&apos;s studio: the father she knew for a few months before he was taken away. Zhou Ximeng killed himself in captivity, aged 27. &quot;It&apos;s painted like a memory. It&apos;s like he&apos;s frozen in that time,&quot; she says. She knows her father from a handful of photographs and from the stories her mother has told, of a smart, confident, capable man \u2013 too accomplished, perhaps. &quot;My mother said he was an overachiever.,&quot; Chow says. &quot;Whatever he did, he excelled at \u2013 he was always top of his class. The\u00a0reason she gave for his suicide was that he had never encountered any huge obstacles. I think he reached a point where it was all beyond his control and he didn&apos;t feel\u00a0he could change anything. You had to first renounce yourself and then renounce your family and friends. I think, when he got to that point, really, he just closed up.&quot; Zhou came from a long line of landowners and scholars; his father, a\u00a0renowned paleontologist, had spent time in America and Taiwan. But in the Cultural Revolution such a privileged pedigree condemned him. All it took was &quot;some really small comment&quot; for him to be seized and held, in a village outside Beijing. His body lies somewhere near the train tracks where he died. Xu has painted Zhou&apos;s mother, too; another of the casualties: she never recovered from her son&apos;s death and killed herself years later. Chow and her mother moved to Hong Kong \u2013 and later the US \u2013 as soon as China began to open up after Mao&apos;s death. Friends were equally keen to leave but too frightened to apply thanks to the previous decade&apos;s frequent reversals: &quot;They say one thing, you do it, then they say, &apos;You guys are going to jail because you have revealed your true selves.&apos;&quot; Her father was subsequently forgiven &quot;for his crimes, whatever they were&quot;, she says. &quot;I don&apos;t feel bitter or angry \u2013 I feel sad for him, that he missed so much,&quot; adds Chow, now 42, and who has two daughters. She wants the next generation to comprehend what happened. &quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t think they really know about it or understand it or even talk about it. It&apos;s important for them to know what their ancestors went through and what was lost.&quot; Lin Zhu, widow of Liang Sicheng,\u00a0the father of modern Chinese\u00a0architecture When Liang Sicheng was denounced as a counter-revolutionary, he was scared to look even his wife in the eye. Lin Zhu, who had been working in the countryside at the time, rushed home to him on learning the news. &quot;He said, &apos;I&apos;ve been waiting for you and missing you every day, but\u00a0I&apos;m afraid to see you,&apos; &quot; the 83-year-old recalls, reaching for a\u00a0tissue to wipe away tears. Her husband sensed the horror ahead. Beijing&apos;s Tsinghua University \u2013 one of the country&apos;s top institutions \u2013 was already covered in posters attacking\u00a0professors. &quot;Back then, I thought this was like a dark cloud that would soon pass. I\u00a0didn&apos;t realise it would cover the country for the next 10 years,&quot; Lin says. When it lifted, Liang was dead, his health wrecked by the scores of lengthy &quot;struggle sessions&quot; publicly to humiliate him; by beatings from Red Guards; and by the cold, damp conditions of the building to which the family had been moved. Lin still struggles to understand how hundreds of millions could participate in such cruelties. Some of Liang&apos;s persecutors were forced into taking part, she says; others were jealous of his success. Most were young students who did not understand his ideas. To her husband, who had loved teaching, that was particularly painful. &quot;He wrote confession letters, one after another, but didn&apos;t know what he had done. The most important claim was that he had received a &apos;capitalist education&apos;. No one could\u00a0tell us what proletarian architectural design was \u2013 and you were too afraid to ask.&quot; As the movement escalated, Lin\u00a0considered demands to join it: &quot;I\u00a0thought probably I would be beaten to death by the Red Guards. Maybe my children would desert me\u00a0and my friends would keep their distance. But I couldn&apos;t understand what Liang Sicheng had done. I\u00a0couldn&apos;t go against my conscience by leaving him.&quot; Together they endured six years of enforced Maoist study and public denunciations that often ran for hours. &quot;Because it was all day long, the brain sort of became numb,&quot; Lin\u00a0recalls. &quot;Normally he was not beaten up at those sessions, but sometimes they would come and beat us at home.&quot; Liang&apos;s ordeal ended when he grew so sick that he could no longer rise from his bed for the struggle sessions. He died in 1972, aged 70. In later years, Lin worked with her\u00a0husband&apos;s accusers; some, quietly, apologised. She does not blame individuals for caving into pressure to attack others, though she is adamant that she never did so. She even suggests those years helped her to grow. &quot;Whatever happens, whatever comes, I&apos;m not afraid any more. It made me stronger and made me think,&quot; she\u00a0says. But she fears that intellectual life\u00a0in China has never fully recovered \u2013 and she worries the country could\u00a0see another such movement. &quot;Many of us are concerned about whether we can avoid a similar disaster in future. History doesn&apos;t repeat itself exactly\u2026 but it&apos;s possible.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/25/leap-year-babies-birthday", "publicationDate": "2012-02-25T00:04:00Z", "tags": ["Family", "Life and style", "Parents and parenting"], "sentences": ["In New Zealand and Taiwan a person born on 29 February can officially celebrate on the preceding day, but in the UK it is generally held that their official birthdate in non-leap years is 1 March."], "title": "A first birthday \u2013 at four years old", "article": "Four years ago, my twin daughters were born, but this week they will celebrate their first real birthday. They were delivered some time in the morning (it was a long labour) on 29 February 2008, but the implications of having leap-day babies didn&apos;t sink in until I took them for their six-week check-up. The GP&apos;s registration system didn&apos;t recognise their birth date: 29 February didn&apos;t exist. There is a one in 1,461 chance of being born on 29 February, so a leap-day birthday isn&apos;t that rare, but there is\u00a0something about it that appeals to my love of the uncommon. There&apos;s even a special name for someone born\u00a0on that day: a leapling. The first thing everyone wants to know is when\u00a0we celebrate our daughters&apos; birthday and so far it&apos;s been tricky to decide. The first year we gave them their presents (duly ignored in favour of the packaging) on 28 February, but it didn&apos;t feel like their birthday. When they turned two we plumped for 1 March, but celebrating in a different month felt wrong. Last year we explained the situation, offering them a choice of dates for their third birthday. The more impatient Evie went for 28 February, while Georgie decided on 1 March. It was the perfect solution for twins otherwise resigned to sharing everything, and a strategy we&apos;ll adopt in the future. This year we&apos;ll make a big\u00a0fuss of their first proper birthday, with the usual over-indulgence in presents, a table groaning with E numbers and more than a few tears before bedtime. I had imagined my daughters would be too young to understand the significance of the day, but fellow leapling Mike Wood says he perfectly recalls his fourth birthday \u2013 for all the wrong reasons. &quot;For months I had been looking forward to having a party on my actual birthday. Everything was planned and I was beside myself with excitement about my big day. Then I got mumps. The whole thing was called off and I vividly remember spending the day playing football on the drive on my own \u2013 I was devastated.&quot; Fortunately for Mike, his eighth birthday passed without mishap, with a big party to make up for missing his fourth. This year, Mike will turn 48 and he plans a weekend away to celebrate. &quot;This will be my 12th birthday,&quot; he says, &quot;and it does feel special, but it&apos;s never bothered me on the non-leap years not to have a proper birthday \u2013 it&apos;s\u00a0quite nice being able to choose when to celebrate.&quot; Most years, of course, it doesn&apos;t matter when your real birthday is, but what about those pivotal milestones? What happens when you turn 17 on a non-leap year, desperate to jump behind the wheel of mum&apos;s Renault? &quot;I had to wait until 1 March,&quot; says Mike, &quot;just as I had to wait for 1 March before\u00a0buying my first legal pint the following year. Needless to say, when my daughters asked me why they only had a birthday once every four years, I didn&apos;t have the answer at my fingertips. At barely four, they were satisfied with my mumbled explanation about &quot;keeping the seasons in order&quot; but I thought I&apos;d better mug up on it for the next time they ask. My ancient encyclopaedia tells me that leap years are necessary to keep our calendar aligned with the Earth&apos;s revolutions around the sun. It takes the Earth approximately 365.24 days to orbit the sun, so without an intercalary day every four years we would lose nearly six hours from the calendar each year, amounting to 24 lost days each century. Introduced by Julius Caesar, the four-yearly leap days stopped just short of solving the problem, requiring a further tweak when the Gregorian calendar was introduced 1,500 years later. The calendar has remained in place ever since and a leap day now occurs in years that are evenly divisible by four, but not in years divisible by 100 unless the year is also divisible by 400. Confused? I was. The formula means that 1800 and 1900 were not leap years, but 2000 was. &quot;The millennium was pretty special,&quot; says Mike, &quot;because normally the turn of a century wouldn&apos;t have a leap day. 2000 did because it&apos;s divisible by four as well as 100. That&apos;s a bit nerdy of me to know that, isn&apos;t it?&quot; The day a leapling legally comes of age is the subject of confusion across the world. In New Zealand and Taiwan a person born on 29 February can officially celebrate on the preceding day, but in the UK it is generally held that their official birthdate in non-leap years is 1 March. The DVLA struggled with the scenario I presented to them about my daughters&apos; future eligibility to drive: &quot;But they are only four,&quot; said the chap on the phone. &quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;they are now, but I was just wondering which day they&apos;ll be able to drive \u2013 will it be 28 February or 1 March\u00a02025?&quot; After a weighty pause he said: &quot;You won&apos;t be able to get a provisional licence for them until they&apos;re 17.&quot; Thanks. Jon Hayward, an economic development officer from Solihull, has always celebrated his leap-day birthday on 28 February. &quot;It never occurred to me that the celebratory drink I bought in a pub in Wolverhampton might have been illegal after all,&quot; he muses. This year Jon will be 32 and plans to celebrate retro-style with an &quot;I am eight&quot; birthday party. &quot;My wife has been taking the mickey all year because I&apos;ve been looking forward to this so much. I&apos;ve taken the whole day off work, and we&apos;re going to have cheese and pineapple on sticks and silly party\u00a0games.&quot; Like Mike, Jon&apos;s childhood birthdays are etched in his memory. He recalls the cake with blue icing his mother bought and the fuss his parents made of him when leap day came around. &quot;I&apos;ve always liked having an unusual birthday,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s always a great talking point. When I was at college I got chatting to someone and we discovered we were both leaplings, although we both thought the other was joking. It&apos;s the only time I&apos;ve ever met someone with the same birthday as me.&quot; There must be something in the water in my home town of Chipping Norton: my friend Anna Hubbard&apos;s son, Jenson, was born on the same day as my twins, and our neighbour, Carol Brown, is also a leapling. When we moved into the street a few years ago, Carol&apos;s then 70-year-old husband took great delight in telling us his wife was only 16. I was somewhat relieved when Carol came out in her slippers to explain. At the time I had no idea I was already pregnant with the twins, who were born on her birthday the following year. Pat Norman, from Moulton in Lincolnshire, was born on 29 February 1940 and, like my neighbour, Carol, she celebrates her 18th leap-birthday next week. In contrast to other leaplings I spoke to, Pat doesn&apos;t think there is anything special about her birthday. &quot;My mother never made a fuss about birthdays, although she did let me have a few friends home from school when I turned 12,&quot; she says. &quot;It was my first party and only allowed because it was a leap year and because I&apos;d just started secondary school and was trying to make friends. Other birthdays just came and went without much recognition.&quot; Now Pat says it&apos;s her children and grandchildren who find her special birth date worthy of celebration. &quot;They&apos;ll always say, &apos;Oh, Mum, it&apos;s your special birthday this year.&apos; Mind you, it is nice to have a little bit of fuss. My grandson&apos;s 18 this year too \u2013 maybe we should have a joint party.&quot; Someone who is far more excited about her birthday this year is telecomms account manager Carol Hughlock, who will be 48 on Wednesday. &quot;I&apos;ll get lots of &apos;Now you are 12&apos; cards from my friends and from my sister,&quot; she says, &quot;which I love, of course \u2013 no one says no to knocking a few years off their age!&quot; As a child, Carol was made to have her birthday on 1 March. &quot;I hated having to wait, so as soon as I was old enough I opted for 28 February.&quot; She says that in non-leap years her birthdays feel flat, and there&apos;s something peculiar about not seeing your birthdate on the calendar. &quot;It&apos;s like going to sleep on Christmas Eve and waking up on Boxing Day.&quot; That&apos;s no excuse in her book, though, for not celebrating and she recounts with vigour the awful year her husband didn&apos;t acknowledge her birthday at all. &quot;I went off to work thinking perhaps he&apos;d arranged for some flowers to arrive later that day or that he was saving my present till the evening. But when the whole day passed without any mention of my birthday at all, I had to ask him what he was playing at. &quot;&apos;But you haven&apos;t got one this year,&apos; he protested \u2013 I still haven&apos;t forgiven him.&quot; Fortunately he pulled out all the stops for her 40th, when the couple went to Las Vegas for the ultimate birthday celebration. &quot;We stayed up all\u00a0night to see dawn break on 29 February, then took a helicopter ride through the Grand Canyon. It was incredible.&quot; America is the place for a leapling looking for recognition of their special day. It&apos;s the home of The Honor Society of Leap Year Day Babies, an online membership club for more than 10,000 people born on 29 February. Administered by leaplings Raenell Dawn and Peter Brouwer, the site boasts a bizarre glossary of terms such as &quot;leapette&quot; (a woman born on 29 February), &quot;leapless&quot; (those poor unfortunates not born on 29 February), and &quot;leapophile&quot; (a collector of all things leap-related). Of course, there&apos;s merchandise: from cards and soap to T-shirts and iPad covers. Tempted though I am by a pair of sweatshirts sporting the phrase &quot;Love me, I&apos;m a Leaper&quot;, I&apos;ll give them a miss for the twins&apos; celebrations. However, mindful of Mike&apos;s and Jon&apos;s clear memories of their first proper birthdays, I&apos;ll do my best to give my own leaplings something to remember. After all, I can take the next three years off, can&apos;t I?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/29/facebook-breastfeeding-photo-policy-confused", "publicationDate": "2012-02-29T11:52:41Z", "tags": ["Breastfeeding", "Facebook", "Parents and parenting", "Women", "Health & wellbeing", "Media", "Internet", "Social networking", "Family", "Technology", "Life and style", "World news"], "sentences": ["&quot;The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, [that is] for those [parents] who desire to complete the term of suckling.&quot; In Taiwan, the Public Breastfeeding Act safeguards the right to breastfeed in public, and those who forbid, eject, or interfere with breastfeeding in public are fined."], "title": "Sorry, Facebook \u2013 on breastfeeding you seem rather confused | Belinda Phipps", "article": "Along with all the photos of special events, weddings, birthdays, balls, sports triumphs and prizegivings, mums and dads are putting photos of their babies on Facebook. Sometimes their baby is eating when photographed and sometimes they are taking a feeding break and looking at the camera. Lovely \u2013 except Facebook thinks if that baby happens to be breastfeeding when the photo is taken and someone complains about seeing a woman&apos;s breasts they must take it down to protect &quot;children as young as 13&quot; who may be on Facebook. Facebook, in response to a challenge from the Guardian, has stated:  &quot;The vast majority of breast-feeding pictures posted to Facebook don&apos;t break our rules \u2026 so they remain on our site. However some photos, like ones that contain a fully exposed breast that do break our rules, so we will remove them if they are reported to us.&quot;  Facebook is very confused. They seem to think breasts are only about sex, but breasts have more than one function. Adults know that lips and hands are used for sex, but if they are being used for eating, smiling or waving we all understand that it is fine for children to see them and for pictures containing hands and lips to be on Facebook. So please can we apply the same rule to breasts and to nipples \u2013 yes, even to nipples. Far from &quot;protecting&quot; children from seeing breasts used for their biologically normal function, research suggests that it is helpful for children and young adults to see breastfeeding as a normal activity and to allow them to develop an everyday language for talking about how babies are fed. There is good evidence that seeing someone you know and care about breastfeeding their baby is likely to make it feel like a more realistic option when it comes to decisions about feeding your own baby, and improved normalisation of breastfeeding in public places (including on the internet) may increasingly enable future parents to consider it themselves. The outdated notion that breastfeeding is something that should be hidden away contradicts international public health messages, which encourage mothers to breastfeed exclusively for six months, with continued breastfeeding up to two years and beyond. It also seems to run against the direction of recent UK equality legislation, which makes it clear that mothers have the right to breastfeed wherever they are with their babies. In its response to the Guardian, Facebook emphasise that its is &quot;a diverse 845 million people strong community&quot;. The implication is that while Facebook may &quot;agree that breastfeeding is natural&quot; and feel comfortable with pictures of mothers breastfeeding, there are many people who would not be. In fact, most adults are just fine with seeing mothers breastfeed. In a Department of Health (England) survey, 84% of adults didn&apos;t have a problem with women breastfeeding in public places. This was repeated in a survey in Wales, where 85% of adults weren&apos;t concerned about women breastfeeding in front of them. Its worth considering whether the whole hoo-ha isn&apos;t a bit of an outmoded western taboo \u2013 in Egypt, India and many other countries, mothers don&apos;t worry about breastfeeding or exposing their breasts to do so when they are out and about, even if their faces are covered. Arguments that certain cultures or religions would be offended by images of breastfeeding are also unsubstantiated. Islam encourages breastfeeding in its texts. &quot;The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, [that is] for those [parents] who desire to complete the term of suckling.&quot; In Taiwan, the Public Breastfeeding Act safeguards the right to breastfeed in public, and those who forbid, eject, or interfere with breastfeeding in public are fined. In Saudi Arabia, women openly breastfeed their babies even though they may be fully veiled. In the Philippines, breastfeeding is protected by various laws and mothers are allowed to breastfeed in public, with public institutions and buildings required to provide places where mothers can breastfeed or express milk should they wish and these must not be in bathrooms. And in the land where Facebook was founded, 47 states had passed legislation by 2009 which provides an explicit right for women to breastfeed in public or to at least exempt them from prosecution under indecency laws. Facebook is in a position to make a big difference to mothers and their babies across the globe right now by doing very little. All the company needs to do is to change its policy so it no longer undermines the support mothers are looking for, and getting, from family and friends. A positive side-effect of a change of policy would be that more parents can learn directly from mothers they know personally about &quot;what breastfeeding looks like&quot; and that women and their partners with least experience of breastfeeding have more opportunity to see their friends&apos; pictures on the internet.

One imagines the conversation would have gone something like this: &quot;I want to write about the Holocaust.&quot; &quot;Great. That sells.&quot; &quot;About Anne Frank.&quot; &quot;Even better.&quot; &quot;A guy discovers her living in his attic. She&apos;s a bitter old woman who swears, eats dead birds and defecates down air vents.&quot; Silence. The brilliance of Hope: A Tragedy is that it pulls off this potentially offensive conceptual feat with devastating aplomb. More than that, Auslander has written one of the funniest books of the last decade: a raging, hilarious polemic on the inescapability of history and the ambiguous nature of hope. The protagonist is Solomon Kugel, a young Jewish professional who yearns for nothing more than to protect his only child, three-year-old Jonah, from all the awful things that could happen to him. To this end, Kugel moves his family \u2013 including his wife Bree and his ageing mother \u2013 out of New York to a picturesque farmhouse in the rural town of Stockton. There is a local arsonist on the loose but otherwise Stockton is &quot;famous for nothing&quot;.\u00a0 The nothingness appeals because Kugel is a man suffocated by history. His childhood was overshadowed by the constant threat of tragedy, encouraged by his mother who, despite being born in Brooklyn in 1946, imagines she is a survivor of the concentration camps. When a young Kugel asks why his mother has placed a lampshade beside him on the bed, she replies: &quot;That&apos;s your grandfather.&quot; When he protests that it says &quot;Made in Taiwan,&quot; his mother snaps: &quot;Well, they&apos;re not going to write Made in Buchenwald, are they?&quot; Kugel&apos;s mother is the source of much of the novel&apos;s blackest humour. In the farmhouse, she wakes up screaming every morning: &quot;She had done so ever since reading that this was common behaviour among survivors of the Holocaust.&quot; When Kugel recalls a trip the two of them made to a concentration camp when he was a teenager, he remembers his mother&apos;s ire when he mistakenly smiled while posing for a photo by the gas ovens. &quot;You ruined the whole concentration camp for me, you know that?&quot; Much of this runs the risk of being tasteless but Auslander is adept at treading the line between humour and offensiveness. The target of his satire is not the Holocaust itself but the mawkish self-absorption of those who use it for their own ends, who relish the hierarchy of victimhood rather than cherishing the triumph of survival. The living, breathing Anne Frank stands in metaphorical opposition to Kugel&apos;s mother: here is a survivor who cannot admit that she is still alive in case it debunks the powerful myth that she unwittingly created. After 60 years in hiding, Anne Frank is trapped in Kugel&apos;s attic by her own reputation. She spends her nights typing an endless manuscript and repeatedly reminds Kugel of her impressive sales figures. &quot;Thirty-two million copies,&quot; she screams as he attempts to coax her out of the attic. &quot;That&apos;s nothing to sneeze at!&quot; The irony is that Kugel becomes so obsessed with protecting Anne Frank that he forgets to look after his own family. Jonah \u2013 despite being the reason for moving to the country \u2013 makes only brief appearances. Bree moves out after Kugel refuses to evict the old lady from the attic. So it is that Kugel becomes crushed by the weight of his own cultural baggage. He remains caught between the desire to make things better and the belief that disaster lurks behind every street corner (throughout the novel, Kugel jots down possible &quot;last words&quot; in a special notebook so that, when the time comes, he will be ready with the appropriate bon mots). His existential plight is represented in the form of two supporting characters. Kugel&apos;s therapist, Professor Jove, insists that hope is a delusion and causes only unhappiness. On the other side is Kugel&apos;s brother-in-law, Pinkus, an academic who believes the world is becoming &quot;more humane, more caring, less violent&quot;. Kugel seems to have more sympathy with the former: his family might disintegrate around him, he might have an unwanted tenant in the attic, his house might burn down, but at least he can always rely on hopelessness to be his faithful companion. It is to Auslander&apos;s credit that he riffs expertly on the human condition while writing a book that is also uproariously funny."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/04/observer-editorial-new-industrial-policy", "publicationDate": "2012-03-04T00:04:36Z", "tags": ["Manufacturing sector", "US economic growth and recession", "Economics", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Business", "UK news"], "sentences": ["A political aversion to a &quot;proper industrial policy&quot; has allowed other nations, among them Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Germany, to sprint ahead."], "title": "Britain needs to shape an industrial strategy | Observer editorial", "article": "Later this week, Vince Cable, the business secretary, addresses the national manufacturing conference, a body asking questions pertinent not just to its own sector \u2013 worth 12% of GDP \u2013 but to the health of the nation as a whole. On growth, is the government strategy of deficit reduction the right one? And, on global competitiveness, how well placed is the UK to do business? One possible answer to both questions blows dust off an idea pushed to the back of the policy cupboard by a succession of governments. It has been boldly reclaimed recently by Mr Cable. Namely, the need for a coherent industrial strategy. In truth, as the Cambridge economist Ha-Joon Chang argues, the UK has had an industrial strategy for years but focused only on the financial sector, at a staggering cost. The need to rebalance the economy, and address what is the sharpest decline in manufacturing of any advanced economy over the past 30 years, grows in urgency by the day. As Mr Cable says, this will not happen with &quot;an uncritical belief in self-correcting markets&quot;. Last week, David Cameron grilled his cabinet colleagues on how they will deliver growth. Ministers are scrambling to piece together fragments of a vision of how UK plc is going to foster innovation and generate jobs, products, and services. A vision that, as the TUC argues cogently, creates a &quot;new manufacturing ecosystem&quot; that also responds to the challenge of what the world will need in 2025. In the here and now, the news for ordinary men and women grows grimmer. On Friday, Mr Cable returned from a flying visit to New York to ask GM bosses to spare its Ellesmere Port plant. More than 2,000 jobs could be affected by closure, as well as a spider&apos;s web of suppliers. Last week, too, BAE Systems confirmed that 100 years of manufacturing at its factory in Yorkshire will end, meaning unemployment for hundreds. Bombardier in Derby cut 1,200 jobs last year after it failed to win the \u00a31.4bn Thameslink train contract. Now it waits to hear if it has successfully bid for the \u00a31bn Crossrail contract. Its loss could mean the death of train manufacturing in Britain. Last week, Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman of JCB, published a study that suggested a plan to strengthen the role of manufacturing while cutting the country&apos;s spiralling trade deficit on factory-made goods. The strategy includes tax breaks for research and development, a cut in corporation tax and the appointment, inevitably, of a &quot;manufacturing tsar&quot;. &quot;My ideas are not radical,&quot; Sir Anthony explained. &quot;My feeling is that [in the economy as a whole] Britain is in a crisis and we&apos;re not doing enough about it.&quot; Mr Cable appears to concur. Last week, he committed what is apostasy to his &quot;small government&quot;, deregulating Tory colleagues. He called for &quot;a proper industrial policy&quot;. The Observer agrees. So what shape should it take? The government has launched a number of initiatives including a regional growth fund; the green investment bank (borrowing powers delayed until 2015) and targeted support, for instance, to advanced manufacturing (aerospace, life sciences, pharmaceuticals). However, given the colossal scale of the challenge, such measures are Lilliputian. A political aversion to a &quot;proper industrial policy&quot; has allowed other nations, among them Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Germany, to sprint ahead. The aversion is cross-party, rooted in the 1970s, when it became associated with &quot;picking winners&quot;. In practice, that meant companies already terminal such as British Leyland. The free market ideology of Mrs Thatcher added further hammer blows. In the late 1990s, a prescient Peter Mandelson, as Labour&apos;s business secretary, endorsed &quot;industrial activism&quot; and, in a range of measures, moved policy on from &quot;mills and smokestacks&quot; to embrace the knowledge, science, innovation and technology sectors. In spite of this, as Will Hutton, the Observer&apos;s columnist, has written often, British companies continue to &quot;under-invest, under-innovate and under-compete&quot;. In a stringent pamphlet, Chris Benjamin, formerly of the Department of Trade and Industry, says the UK &quot;lacks the sinews, networks and public perception of a genuine industrial society&quot;. Some in the current government believe companies should be &quot;freed&quot; to find their own route to prosperity. Others make the trip to Germany. In the 1990s, that country was running on flat tyres with low growth and high unemployment, a mirror of the UK today. In 2009, it had a serious minus growth rate; a year later, it had turned this round. How had it been achieved? Cuts in benefits and a measure of deregulation helped but so too did its respect for deep institutional foundations such as Mittelstand, small to medium family firms that plan for the long term rather than the quick buck. Technical and vocational education is rated; a network of 428 German savings banks supports local businesses. In addition, KfW, a state investment bank, finances public infrastructure projects and cushions downturns. Labour is exploring a British version. Germany also has workers and union representation in company decision-making. The US, too, offers lessons. In the 1980s, for example, the semi-conductor industry was strengthened when 14 manufacturers collaborated with strong government support. Sematech now has 50% of the global market. A &quot;proper&quot; UK industrial strategy begins with an audit of the economy outside the Square Mile. We need to &quot;pick winners&quot; from infant industries, not those already in their death throes. Tax breaks? The Treasury awaits an inquiry into the ramifications of cutting the 50p tax. In Canada, the video games industry has games tax relief and in 2008 it workforce grew by 30%, while in the UK the sector declined by 10%. Caution is required on deregulation if it means reducing employee protection. A strategy requires a procurement policy (Crossrail?); banks that lend; investment in infrastructure, including the north (receiving, for instance, only 7.6% of the transport budget); and attention paid to the fact that 82,000 engineers, scientists and technicians are required over the next four years. Government activity on exports is vital. An overhaul of the finance sector is signalled by Professor John Kay&apos;s interim report suggesting, for instance, an end to quarterly reporting that puts the shareholder&apos;s dividend before long-term growth. Even before the recession, we were in trouble. The UK&apos;s share of world exports fell from 4.4% in 2000 to 2.8% in 2009. Politicians repeating the word &quot;growth&quot; will not summon up the genie.

He was in the fields when the Kholpatua river surged over the 30ft-high earthen embankment, sending a wall of water across the fields. &quot;I ran home when I saw the water and grabbed my wife, son and daughter,&quot; he said. &quot;We hung on to a tree for two or three hours during the storm.&quot; No one in Adarsha Gram died in the storm that killed 300 people and destroyed 4,000km of roads and embankments. But the villagers saw their livelihood from shrimp farming wiped out. The river created a lake that cut road access \u2013 the village can only be reached by boat \u2013 and deposited huge amounts of grey sludge around the village \u2013 which sits on land flat as a pancake, destroying the shrimp ponds. &quot;Before Aila, I lived very well from my shrimp pond,&quot; said Dhali. &quot;Now I work as a day labourer and I don&apos;t have enough money to restart the business.&quot; Dhali&apos;s story represents in microcosm the threat from climate change to low-lying Bangladesh. The densely populated country of 164 million is highly vulnerable to the prospect or rising sea levels and melting glaciers. Over the last 20 years, the country has been hit by six major disasters \u2013 four floods and two cyclones \u2013 affecting millions. In 1991 a cyclone killed 138,000 people, and in 2007 a combined flood and cyclone killed up to 10,000 and affected 15 million. About half of the world&apos;s deaths due to tropical cyclones have occurred in Bangladesh. Migration for those living at the edge of the Bay of Bengal \u2013 the world&apos;s largest bay \u2013 area is not feasible as around 15 million Bangladeshis live in areas vulnerable to climate change. Adarsha Gram lies in the Sundarbans, a watery and muddy world of mangrove forests that is home to the famed Bengal tiger, wild boars, macaque monkeys and estuarine crocodiles. With migration not a realistic option for many, adaptation becomes imperative. After Aila, Brac, a Bangladeshi NGO, supported the villagers financially and helped build cyclone-resistant homes. Designed by Brac university in consultation with the villagers and funded by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the 43 cyclone-resistant structures at Adarsha Gram now stand on four concrete pillars, which are 7ft above ground and 6ft below. Besides the houses built of wood and brick roof tiles, the village of 300 households also has a schoolhouse that doubles up as a cyclone shelter for people and livestock \u2013 a concrete staircase for people and an earthen ramp for the cows and other animals. The school&apos;s distinctive wall has gaps between the bricks, allowing wind to pass through the building so that it doesn&apos;t have to absorb the full shock of 240km/h winds. Having cyclone-resistant homes may provide some reassurance for villagers in case a cyclone hits again, but that does not feed them. Apart from destroying homes, flooding also destroys livelihoods. Three years after Aila, the villagers have only now begun to dig shrimp ponds in the expanse of grey earth that blends with grey February skies. They will, however, not be working for themselves, but for a businessman who has leased 850 acres of the communal land for shrimp farming, which is very popular in the Koyra region. But shrimp farming has a downside, explained Mohammed Zahidur Rahman, from Brac&apos;s disaster, environment and climate change programme. &quot;Once land is given over to shrimp farming, it becomes useless to farming after 10-15 years because the land becomes too salty,&quot; he said, &quot;and most of the profits do not go to the farmers but those businessmen who have leased the land.&quot; Yet, whole villages have adopted shrimp farming and the landscape in the area is full of large rectangular ponds that alternate with paddy and maize fields. Brac is promoting alternative activities such as growing salt-tolerant rice and maize, as well as crab-fattening. Crabs, which mature in 15 days, have the advantage of taking up less space and \u2013 provided they are the right size \u2013 find a ready export market in countries such as Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. But there are no simple solutions. Crabs have a tendency to fight. Those that lose a claw in combat are no good for export, although one-limbed crabs do end up in tasty curry dishes that are a welcome source of protein for some families. Crabs can also die from viruses. &quot;I&apos;m earning good money. Crabs are more profitable than shrimp, but sometimes most of my crabs die,&quot; said Jossi Rani, at Deyara village, 23km from Adarsha Gram, as she cuts up talapia fish to feed her crabs. Apart from the threat of cyclones, a more insidious problem for those living in the Sundarbans is increasing water salination, making it hard to grow even salt-resistant rice and maize. Drinking water is also an issue. Even water in a deep aquifer \u2013 700ft \u2013 in the coastal area contains too much salt to drink. Brac has imported two desalination plants from China to provide drinking water, but they have broken down and are awaiting Chinese engineers to come and repair them. Brac&apos;s work in disaster and climate change \u2013 from training tens of thousands of residents in disaster peparedness and response to helping people earn a living \u2013 blurs the line between disaster relief and development. But in areas of high vulnerability to climate change, from Bangladesh to the drought-prone Sahel in west Africa, development and humanitarian organisations increasingly see their work as complementary. Kristalina Georgieva, the EU&apos;s head of humanitarian operations, makes the case that it is no longer affordable to wait for crises to hit when it is cheaper \u2013 and the right thing to do \u2013 is to take pre-emptive action. In the Sahel, where relief groups are working hard to prevent a humanitarian disaster from the recent drought, the EU has agreed \u20ac150m in development funding on top of \u20ac123m in emergency assistance. In Ethiopia, the World Food Programme is increasingly moving into development work, helping farmers to rehabilitate degraded soil. Three years on, the residents of Adarsha Gram have yet to recover from cyclone Aila \u2013 a stark reminder of the enormous challenges in building resilience. Shrimp farming has provided some welcome money, but the soil will get saltier and the embankment risks being weakened as villagers run pipes through it to siphon water from the Kholpatua."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/mar/05/interview-jane-finnis-culture24", "publicationDate": "2012-03-05T16:04:00Z", "tags": ["Culture professionals network", "Leadership", "Communications"], "sentences": ["The Culturemondo network I chair is an example of this and has taken me to Cuba, Croatia, New Zealand, Japan, Taiwan, USA and Europe."], "title": "Arts head: Jane Finnis, chief executive of Culture24", "article": "When and why did you join Culture24? I joined in 2000 after 10 full-on years at [the Brighton digital culture agency] Lighthouse. We were among a handful of arts organisations that began exploring the impact of digital from the moment the web was available in the early 90s. I remember very clearly sensing the fundamental shift that these technologies would bring and seeing their potential to change the way we play, think and learn. Leaving Lighthouse was a tough decision. We had just had a visit from the Queen, won awards for innovation and bought our own building. But something changed after the birth of my daughter and returning to work, it felt that my real baby had taken the place of my other baby. So when I saw the advert for what was then a single website (24 Hour Museum), set up under the vision of Chris Smith and Loyd Grossman, it seemed perfect. It was simpler, while still allowing me to nurture my passion for culture and technology. Ten years later, I&apos;ve learned that it&apos;s not the job that defines simplicity but the person! How has Culture24&apos;s remit changed over the years? What has stayed the same? I did a presentation in 2009, From portal to publisher, which tracked Culture24&apos;s journey from a sign-posting site to a destination. It mapped what we had learned about audiences, infrastructure and online publishing. Three years on, the picture has changed again and that talk would now need to be called &quot;From portal to publisher to platform&quot;. The platform comes from our data aggregation work and understanding how well-structured information can be re-used in multiple places, to multiple effect for more people. You can see this trajectory of change in newspaper publishing everywhere. One important thing that hasn&apos;t changed is the &apos;Why do we care?&apos; factor. The team at Culture24 is driven by a passion for the stuff, stories, artefacts and art that touch our lives in ways that mean something to us as individuals and as a society. How do you keep track of digital developments and sort the good from the bad? I don&apos;t; it is impossible. What I do try is to look for three things: \u2022 What are the big brands doing to make money and build reputation? \u2022 What are the artists who work with technology doing, in particular with software, coding and participation? \u2022 Where is there anything digital with purpose and passion that shines out above the tools used to create it? I am also a big fan of failure and think that it&apos;s underrated in the cultural sector, in particular when it comes to digital. Trying to do something new and getting it wrong can be the most powerful way to learn, if you can be open and honest about the process. This is hard when things are publicly funded as the financial justification is defined by success. I&apos;m trying to change this and kick-start a shift in how failure is viewed with our recent Let&apos;s Get Real report and EPIC FAIL session. Who are your international partners and how do you work with them? The world of digital cultural publishing that Culture24 inhabits is relatively small internationally. We work with whoever is doing anything relevant, from museums like Powerhouse in Australia, aggregators like Plurio.net, established events like PICNIC and large scale initiatives like Europeana. There is a lot to learn from looking at challenges through another&apos;s eyes and I have always been proactive in seeking out like-minded individuals. The Culturemondo network I chair is an example of this and has taken me to Cuba, Croatia, New Zealand, Japan, Taiwan, USA and Europe. You appear at lots of conferences. What do people want to learn from you? I think they want to know how to make technology work for them: the secret to success online, the key to good content and audience development and the formula of the illusive new business models for income generation. What they get is a lot of questions that I hope will challenge them to rethink their use of digital. My hobby horse is to ask people if they really know what they are trying to do online and who it is for &apos;specifically&apos;. What are the challenges of running Culture24 as a sustainable business? Non-profits like Culture24 will always need public funding to secure our core mission and I believe this should be part of a public service based on the evidence of the role the arts play in a dynamic society. As far as online cultural goes, there is still a long way to go before there will be income generation models let alone sustainable ones. Ironically, we are often victims of our own success as people think we are a well-funded, well-resourced, big organisation. The truth is we are 10 feisty creatives, in an overcrowded office in Brighton, who go from one project to another on a mix of annual funding arrangements and hard-earned service delivery. We have also been caught in the middle of the integration of museums/library responsibilities into the Arts Council. You could say we are ahead of this curve as we have been working across all these sectors for years on the basis that audiences online don&apos;t see (or care) about which government department something falls under. Our immediate challenge is helping Arts Council to understand how our work supports many different areas of policy with the same digital infrastructure and network. Wish me luck! Does being a woman affect how you do your job. How hard is it to balance with family? Totally! Balancing the guilt I feel when away from my kids with my personal drive has been the hardest thing I&apos;ve ever faced. For me, there is no point in having kids if I can&apos;t be actively involved and I have been very lucky at Culture24 being able to locate the office in my hometown of Brighton. This means I can take the kids to school, pick up twice a week and juggle holidays. It also means I am never without my iPhone, do my email in bed and rarely have a day without work in it. You studied art, film, video and music \u2013 does that background play into your work? Hugely. All my work has been about convergence, overlap of practice and the spaces between things. In the 80s it was about combining art forms and in the 90s it was about overlapping industries. Now it is about all those things combined with the added complications of policy and digital innovation thrown in. Seeking the links between everything all the time is a kind of curse, like those people who see spelling mistakes and grammatical errors wherever they exist. You are not necessarily looking for them but they are there just like opportunities. What can we expect next from Culture24? Expect a brilliant Museums at Night festival from 18-20 May with a new strand of artist-led events called Connect10; the mobile version of our www.culture24.org.uk site that will give you info on all the museums, galleries and heritage venues near you; and behind the scenes you will see us continuing to work with the BBC to feed them cultural activities for www.bbc.co.uk/thingstodo.

Scientists from the UK and Portugal have tracked the ocean predators to busy fishing grounds, where they believe they are being deliberately targeted by fishermen with &quot;walls of death&quot; from long-line fishing that can stretch as long as 100km. Blue sharks are thought to be the most frequently caught shark species, with population declines of up to 80% in some regions since the 1980s, the fish is now classified as &quot;near-threatened&quot; on the IUCN Red List. Various reasons for its demise have been suggested, but until recently scientists and conservationists were not even sure of blue sharks&apos; movements in the Atlantic. They were not helped by a fishing industry that logs every catch, but does not release or compile its data. The new study published in PLoS One finds the strongest evidence yet that long-line fishing is to blame, prompting the authors to call for the establishment of protected areas. Using satellites, the authors followed the migration of 16 sharks from south-west England and the coast of Portugal. They discovered that the sharks hunted at greater depth than had been previously thought and tended to congregate in the same areas as long-line fishing boats, particularly the continental shelf off the south-west of England. This made them vulnerable to the lines, which can bristle with up to 1,000 hooks and ostensibly target tuna and swordfish, at depths of 100 to 300 metres. The paper&apos;s lead author, Prof David Sims of the Marine Biological Association, said it was no accident that blue sharks are also snared. &quot;The sharks are having to cross a wall of death across the continental shelf edge off the south west of the UK,&quot; he said. &quot;The fishermen know what they are going to be catching. Due to the reduction of target species such as tuna and swordfish, they have come to rely on blue shark and mako shark to improve the profit from each trip.&quot; It&apos;s estimated that 1.1 million blue sharks are caught in the Atlantic each year, mostly by Spanish, Portuguese and Tunisian boats. Most are sold on to Taiwan or Hong Kong, which is the centre of the processing industry. Sharks are slaughtered for their fins, which are used in soup that is popular in Chinese banquets. The demand for this delicacy has surged in the past decade as income levels have risen. In recent months, a high-profile campaign against the practice has prompted a number of leading Hong Kong hotels, such as the Shangri-la group, to take shark fin soup off their menus. But Sims said that action to regulate the source of supply on the high seas was woefully lacking, and that information from the new study should provide the basis for the establishment of marine conservation areas. He also urged regulators \u2013 such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas \u2013 to press fishing companies to release data on what they caught and where. &quot;There is an economic reason why this data isn&apos;t being compiled,&quot; he said. &quot;Of the 20 species of shark that are caught in the Atlantic, only 1% are protected. It&apos;s fair to say high seas fisheries are like the wild west.&quot; Without better protection, he warned the blue shark \u2013 which has long been the most common, large pelagic shark in UK waters \u2013 faces extinction. &quot;There is a good chance that our grandchildren won&apos;t see these sharks,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2012/mar/10/2", "publicationDate": "2012-03-10T18:12:00Z", "tags": ["Zoology", "Science", "Birds", "Wildlife", "Animals"], "sentences": ["This small insectivorous songbird is migratory, wintering mainly in northern Asia, India and Taiwan.", "Here&apos;s an informational video accompanying footage of a female orange-flanked bush-robin (filmed in Taiwan, uploaded 10 December 2010):            Visit hikasiaorg&apos;s YouTube channel [video link]."], "title": "Mystery bird: orange-flanked bush-robin, Tarsiger cyanurus | GrrlScientist", "article": "    Orange-flanked bush-robin, Tarsiger cyanurus (synonyms, Luscinia cyanura, Nemura cyanura and Ianthia cyanura; protonym, Motacilla Cyanurus), Pallas, 1773, also known as the red-flanked bluetail or sometimes as the white-breasted blue wood-chat, photographed in Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of the People&apos;s Republic of China.  Image: Marie-Louise Ng, 11 February 2012 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. Nikon D7000    Question: This small Chinese mystery bird is showing up in the most unlikely places all over the world. Why? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Is it male or female? Response: This is an orange-flanked bush-robin, Luscinia cyanura, probably a first-winter male. This small insectivorous songbird is migratory, wintering mainly in northern Asia, India and Taiwan. They breed in mixed coniferous forests of northern Asia and northeastern Europe, all the way from Finland to Kamchatka and into Japan. Their breeding range is expanding. They&apos;e recently been showing up in Great Britain, and are now are popping up in western Alaska, too.  This is a cavity-nesting species. They nests in holes in bank sides or under tree roots or logs. The female lays up to four pale blue eggs per clutch.  Orange-flanked bush-robins are shy, often remain hidden, even whilst singing. Here&apos;s a nice audio recording of a singing male orange-flanked bush-robin, accompanied by a photograph (recorded in Lieksa, Pohjois-Karjala, Suomi/Finland; uploaded 10 January 2010):            Visit kuujussi&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].  The female orange-flanked bush-robin has olive-brown upperparts, white throat, orangish-red flanks, a bright blue rump and tail. Her bill is black and there is a thin white ring around her black eyes. The male has brilliant blue upperparts and often a pale blue or blue-grey supercilium, but otherwise, resembles the female.  Here&apos;s an informational video accompanying footage of a female orange-flanked bush-robin (filmed in Taiwan, uploaded 10 December 2010):            Visit hikasiaorg&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].  The taxonomy of this species is confusing. The orange-flanked bush-robin is often placed into the genus, Tarsiger, although its placement is dependent upon whom you are arguing with at the moment since it appears that the authorities are more or less equally split regarding this bird&apos;s relationships.  Tarsiger is a genus comprising six species of passerines in the taxonomic family, Muscicapidae (Old World flycatchers). These birds are small, mostly brightly coloured insectivorous birds native to Asia and northeastern Europe; and most of them are reside in the mountains. Even though Tarsiger forms a distinct monophyletic group, it is sometimes subsumed into the related genus Luscinia.  Luscinia is a genus comprising eleven species of nightingales and their relatives, also in Muscicapidae. There is a lot of overlap between these two taxa, which some authorities merge.  Further, as if that isn&apos;t confusing enough, authorities have long been confused as to precisely where Luscinia ends and another genus, Erithacus, begins. In fact, a number of taxa were dumped into one genus or the other, or the Luscinia was merged into Erithacus. The one thing that appears consistent is that the orange-flanked bush-robin was never been placed into Erithacus.  But the confusion regarding the placement of the orange-flanked bush-robin extends beyond its generic placement, too. Originally, the orange-flanked bush-robin and its close relatives were placed into the thrush family Turdidae, although these birds are now thought to be chats (subfamily: Saxicolinae) that are part of the Old World flycatcher family.

The spies are suspected of being behind a campaign to glean information about Admiral James Stavridis from his colleagues, friends and family, sources say. This involved setting up fake Facebook accounts bearing his name in the hope that those close to him would be lured into making contact or answering private messages, potentially giving away personal details about Stavridis or themselves. This type of &quot;social engineering&quot; impersonation is an increasingly common web fraud. Nato said it wasn&apos;t clear who was responsible for the spoof Facebook pages, but other security sources pointed the finger at China. Last year, criminals in China were accused of being behind a similar operation, which was given the codename Night Dragon. This involved hackers impersonating executives at companies in the US, Taiwan and Greece so that they could steal business secrets. The latest disclosure will add to growing fears in the UK and US about the scale of cyber-espionage being undertaken by China. As well as targeting senior figures in the military, the tactic has been blamed for the wholesale theft of valuable intellectual property from some leading defence companies. The sophistication and relentlessness of these &quot;advanced persistent threat&quot; cyber attacks has convinced intelligence agencies on both sides of the Atlantic that they must have been state-sponsored. Nato has warned its top officials about the dangers of being impersonated on social networking sites, and awarded a \u00a340m contract to a major defence company to bolster security at the organisation&apos;s headquarters and 50 other sites across Europe. A Nato official confirmed that Stavridis, who is the supreme allied commander Europe (Saceur), had been targeted on several occasions in the past two years: &quot;There have been several fake Saceur pages. Facebook has cooperated in taking them down\u2026 the most important thing is for Facebook to get rid of them.&quot; The official added: &quot;First and foremost, we want to make sure that the public is not being misinformed. Saceur and Nato have made significant policy announcements on either the Twitter or Facebook feed, which reflects Nato keeping pace with social media. It is important the public has trust in our social media.&quot; Nato said it was now in regular contact with Facebook account managers and that the fake pages were usually deleted within 24 to 28 hours of being discovered. Finding the actual source in cases such as these is notoriously difficult, but another security source said: &quot;The most senior people in Nato were warned about this kind of activity. The belief is that China is behind this.&quot; Stavridis, who is also in charge of all American forces in Europe, is a keen user of social media. He has a genuine Facebook account, which he uses to post frequent messages about what he is doing, and where. Last year he used Facebook to declare that the military campaign in Libya was at an end. The threat posed by Chinese cyber activity has been causing mounting concern in the UK and the US, where it is judged to be a systematic attempt to spy on governments and their militaries. They also accuse Beijing of being involved in the anonymous theft and transfer of massive quantities of data from the west. In a surprisingly pointed report to Congress last year, US officials broke with diplomatic protocol and for the first time challenged China directly on the issue. The National Counterintelligence Executive said Chinese hackers were &quot;the world&apos;s most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage&quot;. It said China appeared to have been responsible for &quot;an onslaught of computer network intrusions&quot;. The report also claimed that Chinese citizens living abroad were being leaned on to provide &quot;insider access to corporate networks to steal trade secrets&quot;. The use of moles was, it said, a clear exploitation of people who might fear for relatives in China. Security analysts in Washington said they believed China had undertaken comprehensive cyber-surveillance of the computer networks that control much of America&apos;s critical infrastructure. This has stoked a political debate on Capitol Hill, where Democrats and Republicans are locked in an ideological battle about how to tackle cyber threats. President Barack Obama wants to introduce regulation to ensure companies are taking them seriously, but that approach is opposed by Republicans, including Senator John McCain. James Lewis, a cyber expert from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies thinktank in Washington, said the time for dithering had passed. &quot;We know that Russia and China have done the reconnaissance necessary to plan to attack US critical infrastructure,&quot; he said. &quot;You might think we should put protection of critical infrastructure at a slightly higher level. It is completely vulnerable.&quot; Shawn Henry, an executive assistant director at the FBI, told the Observer that the agency was dealing with thousands of fresh attacks every month. &quot;We recognise that there are vulnerabilities in infrastructure. That&apos;s why we see breaches by the thousand every single month,&quot; he said. &quot;There are thousands of breaches every month across industry and retail infrastructure. We know that the capabilities of foreign states are substantial and we know the type of information they are targeting.&quot; The department of homeland security has been tasked by the White House with countering the cyber threat, but without making people lose confidence in the web. Its senior counsellor for cyber-security, Bruce McConnell, said: &quot;The internet is civilian space. It is a marketplace. Like the market in Beirut in the 1970s, it will sometimes be a battleground. But its true nature is peaceful, and that must be preserved.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/mar/13/champions-league-clockwatch-live-mbm", "publicationDate": "2012-03-13T21:48:00Z", "tags": ["Champions League 2011-12", "Internazionale", "Marseille", "Bayern Munich", "Basel", "Football", "Champions League", "Sport"], "sentences": ["hahahahaa i was born in Ireland, raised in Taiwan (China), and moved to Canada in 2010, now my only source of entertainment is the guardian football web site and the occasional 4am game.&quot; Oh dear."], "title": "Champions League clockwatch - as it happened | Evan Fanning", "article": " Good evening everybody and welcome to Champions league clockwatch \u2013 an altogether more sophisticated, espresso-sipping, Baudelaire-reading, expensive loafer wearing live blog than the traditional, rough and tumble of the Premier League clockwatch.

Subs: Butt, Petersen, Olic, Pranjic, Contento, Schweinsteiger, Tymoschuk. Basle: Sommer, Steinhofer, Abraham, Dragovic, Park, Cabral, Xhaka, Shaqiri, Fabian Frei, Alexander Frei, Streller. Subs: Colomba, Degen, Huggel, Yapi Yapo, Stocker, Kovac, Zoua.Referee: Mark Clattenburg (Albion) Inter Milan v Marseille Internazionale: Julio Cesar, Maicon, Lucio, Samuel, Nagatomo, Poli, Stankovic, Zanetti, Sneijder, Milito, Forlan. Subs: Castellazzi, Pazzini, Cambiasso, Obi, Ranocchia, Zarate, Faraoni. Marseille: Mandanda, Azpilicueta, Diawara, N&apos;Koulou, Morel, Diarra, M&apos;bia Etoundi, Amalfitano, Valbuena, Andre Ayew, Remy.Subs: Bracigliano, Cheyrou, Brandao, Kabore, Traore, Jordan Ayew, Fanni.Referee: Pedro Proenca (Portugal)  7.42pm: It seems the high culture of European football isn&apos;t good enough for Gary Naylor. He&apos;s off to the ballet instead, but not before writing: &quot;After the ballet tonight, the director and a dancer or two front up and answer questions from us punters in the cheap seats. Perhaps this practice should be adopted in football too. Though people seldom sing &quot;You don&apos;t know what you&apos;re doing&quot; to the creatives in the theatre - so maybe not.&quot; It could catch on, I reckon. &quot;So Arjen, talk us through that pirouette?&quot;  7.45pm: We&apos;re underway in the Allianz and then San San Siro. I&apos;m going to go for Bayern Munich and Marseille to progress.  7.46pm: Marseille look to expose Inter&apos;s vulnerability straight away but Maicon swipes down Ayew in the centre circle but escapes a yellow card. In Munich, Lahm, who is at right back this evening, crosses but it&apos;s far too close to Sommer.  7.48pm: Marseille have started smartly in Milan. Valbuena&apos;s free kick from the right is met by Ayew but Samuel does enough to put him off and the header drifts behind for a goal kick. Paul Taylor has a smart idea. Like most smart ideas it has absolutely no chance of coming to fruition. &quot;Seeing all these continental clubs flourishing in the CL, I wonder if pruning the EPL&apos;s membership from 20 to, say, 14 or 16 might strengthen the remaining clubs, both within the league and for European play \u2013 fewer fixtures to fight, less competition for talent, more time to prepare. The league&apos;s influx of Big Money has, in any event, left its bottom tier hopelessly outclassed, in another league altogether. It would be a real brouhaha to be sure, but then what&apos;s new about that?&quot; Good luck telling the four or six teams that they&apos;re no longer wanted.  7.50pm: First chance for Bayern as Robben gets in behind the Basel defence (which is very high up the field) to latch on to a Muller pass. Robben dawdles on it somewhat and Dragovic gets back to block his weak right-footed shot. Bayern keep the pressure on and Robben tries his luck with his favoured left, cutting in from the right flank and letting fly, but it&apos;s wide of Sommer&apos;s post.  7.53pm: Somehow it&apos;s still 0-0 in Milan. It was a glorious chance for Sneijder and he has to bury it. He has to. Zanetti gets to the byline and cuts the ball back. Marseille fail to clear and it falls to the Dutchman on the six yard box. he opts for power, blasting goalwards. It takes a deflection off Diawara which helps Mandanda who stretches out an arm and blocks. Diawara then hooks the ball away.  Goal! BAYERN MUNICH 1-0 Basel (Robben 10) (1-1 agg). Bayern have the lead in the Allianz and it&apos;s all square on aggregate. Ribery glided across the edge of the are and fired a left footed shot which wrong-footed the Basel defence and fell into the path of Robben (who was onside) and he tucked it away.  7.57pm: This is an onslaught from Bayern. Sommer is called into action twice in 30 seconds - both times denying Mario Gomez. &quot;As a Stoke City follower, I&apos;d like to say that one week ago, when Stoke were pushing for a top ten finish, Paul Taylor&apos;s idea would have been top drawer and a wonderful means of ensuring a robust and competitive Premier League&lt;&quot; says Alex Cowell. &quot;Now that Stoke are 13th, his idea is stupid, unfair, and totally arbitrary.&quot;  8.00pm: Another Valbuena free kick from the right and it requires a sturdy headed clearance from Stankovic to prevent Diawara from getting a header on goal.  8.03pm: Marseille are lucky to still be level on Milan but they&apos;ve actually had the better of the play. Amalfitano crosses from the right towards Loic Remy, who gets a clean header but can&apos;t direct it on target. In Munich it&apos;s one Bayern attack after another. Basel are hanging on.  8.06pm: Brilliant save from Yann Sommer - the third point blank stop of the night from the Baaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllll keeper - as he dives to his right to claw away a header from Gomez (I think). &quot;One other thing I&apos;d like to see football adapt from the ballet,&quot; says Justin Kavanagh. &quot;Any player convicted of diving should be made to wear a tutu for three games. If we&apos;re going to have prima players soaring through the air around like swans, let&apos;s make sure they&apos;re appropriately attired.&quot;  8.09pm: Free kick to Marseille about 30 yards out. Valbueno - who most rival Marek Hamsik and Lisa Simpson for the pointiest hair - swings it into the box but a combination of Stakovic and Maicon get it clear.  8.12pm: It&apos;s still Bayern-Bayern-Bayern at the Allianz but they have yet to get the second which would put them ahead on aggregate. The Basel left-back Park looks like he might need a lie down in a dark room. &quot;Paul Taylor&apos;s comment is based on a belief that success for English teams in Europe is desirable,&quot; writes Jeremy Smith. &quot;Early exits from the Champions League are good for the competitiveness of the Premier League, since there is less cash flowing into the coffers of the top teams. Given a choice between English success in Europe and a competitive domestic league - defined as one with the maximum number of teams having a realistic change of success - I&apos;d much rather have the latter. And as a Villa fan, it has the advantage of preserving Villa&apos;s status as one of the four English European Cup winners.&quot;  8.14pm: Ayew wants a penalty for Marseille as Zanetti steps across him inside the area and comes away with the ball. It&apos;s never a penalty - Ayew stays down for treatment as if he&apos;s trying to convince the ref that it really was a foul. But it wasn&apos;t, and there&apos;s nothing wrong with Ayew.  8.17pm: Bayern have had 60% possession against Basel and have made 190 passes compared with 109 from the Swiss league leaders. It seems like they&apos;ve more dominant than that but who is going to argue with the Uefa stat machine? Seriously, who is?  8.19pm: My colleague Tom Lutz has emailed to say that he has &quot;uploaded a pic of Robben if you want it&quot;. I do want it and here it is. That&apos;s the kind of team work you get at Guardian Towers. If only Inter were taking our lead. In the San Siro Forlan cuts the ball back but nobody is on the same wavelength as the Uruguayan and it&apos;s easily dealt with.  8.21pm: This is a good spell for Basel. They&apos;ve taken the sting out of the game in the pasty few minutes and have even won a couple of corners. As if to warn them not to get above their station Toni Kroos lets fly from distance. He really gets hold of it but it flies wide of Sommer&apos;s post.  8.23pm: Marseille&apos;s Jeremy Morel waddles forward for the first time tonight and shoots from distance with his left foot but it&apos;s always arcing away from Julio Cesar&apos;s goal. &quot;As Mr. Ayew&apos;s lawyer I demand you to wait for sufficient evidence about said tackle,&quot; says Joe Deasy. &quot;Jjust kidding I&apos;m just a 18 year old in Vancouver.&quot; 18 in Vancouver. Some people have all the luck.  GOAL! BAYERN MUNICH 2-0 Basel (Muller 41) (2-1 agg) Bayern have doubled their lead on the night are ahead on aggregate. It&apos;s almost against the run of play. Moments earlier Frei had volleyed over the top, but Bayern go up the other end and Robben swings in a cross from the right and Muller gets free of his man at the near post and clips a tidy finish past the excellent Sommer.  GOAL! BAYERN MUNICH 3-0 Basel (Gomez 44) (3-1 agg) That, you would have to think, is that. It was a simple tap-in for Gomez at the back post after Badstuber, on the stretch, knocked Ribery&apos;s inswinging free kick back across goal.  8.31pm: Injury time at the San Siro and Forlan flashes a header wide of the post. That, and Sneijder&apos;s earlier miss, are Inter&apos;s only real chances of the night so far.  Half time: Inter 0-0 Marseille (0-1 agg)  Half time: Bayern Munich 3-0 Basel (3-1 agg)  Half time emails (all of which focus on whether or not Vancouver is a good place for an 18-year-old): Said 18-year-old Joe Deasy writes: &quot;Luck?? hahahahaa i was born in Ireland, raised in Taiwan (China), and moved to Canada in 2010, now my only source of entertainment is the guardian football web site and the occasional 4am game.&quot; Oh dear. Aaron von Fintel says: &quot;You do realise that the legal age there for buying alcohol, getting in to bars, clubs, strip clubs, etc.. is 19 right? And please, enough with this Marseille/Inter nonsense, what is going on at Bayern? You&apos;re killing me here.&quot; There&apos;s more to life than strip clubs and bars, Aaron. A little bit more.  8.45pm: I hope the people who came up with these BT wifi hotspot advert series are ashamed of themselves. Thoroughly ashamed of themselves. Steven Gerrard has scored for Liverpool to make it 1-0 in the Merseyside derby. Paul Doyle is guiding anyone who is interested through the elbows and flying tackles right here.  8.48pm: Were off again in the Allianz. Surely there&apos;s no way back for Basel? Surely? You don&apos;t have to answer that.  8.49pm: And we&apos;re off in the San Siro too. No changes anywhere at the interval. Except for me. I&apos;ve changed outfit.  8.51pm: Steven House wants to take onthe Uefa stat machine. He writes: &quot;What counts as a pass? A goal-kick, a free-kick, a throw-in, a corner, a cross, a two-foot dink from a free-kick? Does it provide stats for the length of a pass, and whether it was forwards, backwards, sideways? I presuming it knows between successful and failed.&quot; Eh ...  8.51pm: Marseille have come out on the3 front foot at the San Siro and the crowd are really starting to get on the Inter players backs. Remy fires across the face of goal but Ayew can&apos;t out-muscle Maicon and the ball rolls to safety on the right hand side.  GOAL! BAYERN MUNICH 4-0 Basel (Gomez 49) (4-1 agg) That is a wonderful strike from Mario Gomez and whatever slim chance Basel had of finding a way back into the game is gone, gone, gone. Ribery skips past Steinhofer on the left and crossed to the near post where the leaping Gomez somehow managed not only to connect with the ball but divert it past Sommer and that is that. Two for Gomez - he has 32 for the season - and he is going to be after his 11th hat-trick in 17 months.  8.57pm: Inter have a corner which Sneijder will take butv not before Walter Samuel is booked for pushing. It&apos;s great defending from Marseille - I think it&apos;s N&apos;Koulou who heads clear before Samuel can get his bonce on the ball. Sneijder then wastes another attempt to pick out Samuel. He&apos;s given up, hasn&apos;t he? I think Manchester United might have dodged a \u00a335m bullet there. &quot;I&apos;ll dare for the obvious,&quot; dares Jason Graff, &quot;There&apos;s a way to go but a Bayern v Barca final could be a truly great match.&quot;  9.00pm: Sommer is again called into action to save from Gomez at the near post. Robben&apos;s corner somehow makes it all the way to Muller at the back post but he can&apos;t get it under control and Basle put it behind for another corner. And then do the same from Ribery&apos;s corner. The third - from Robben - they at least manage to get clear but Bayern keep the pressure on and Muller&apos;s shot is deflected into Sommer&apos;s hands. More from 18&apos;s Joe Deasy: &quot;Hats off to Aaron von Fintel for realising the pain and agony i must go through as i await my 19th birthday. Is it Ironic that one of the couldiest cities in the world insists on naming its newspaper The Vancouver Sun?&quot;  9.03pm: &quot;Before the game the Basel manager said that Bayern wouldn&apos;t score seven against them. Too late for a bet on the final score of that game?&quot; asks Alex Hanton. It&apos;s never too late Alex. Has Ray Winstone&apos;s dismembered head taught you nothing?  GOAL! BAYERN MUNICH 5-0 Basel (Gomez 60) (5-1 agg) It&apos;s that man Gomez again. It&apos;s yet another hat-trick (hiss 11th in 17 months); it&apos;s his 33rd goal this season and he now has 71 goals in 72 appearances. Ribery again created it, dancing into the area and standing up a cross with his left. It&apos;s shambolic defending from Basel and Gomez just has a simple header inside the six yard box. It may even be a perfect hat-trick but I still have no idea how he managed to direct his acrobatic second past Sommer.  9.07pm: Basel have a goal ruled out - possibly for offside, possibly for handball. I don&apos;t think it was either. Justin Kavanagh emails to say: &quot;Aaron von Fintel should take himself off to the ballet for a good night&apos;s entertainment. If it&apos;s good enough for Gary Naylor \u2026 who tonight has bravely proven that there&apos;s life beyond the Merseyside derby. He&apos;s the Billy Elliot of MBM obsessives.&quot;  9.09pm: &quot;Evan, this is a big night for the two Sheffield clubs,&quot; says Brian Russell. &quot;The Blades are playing their game in hand - can you switch to covering that game please? Got to be more interesting than the Inter-Marseille muck.&quot; Inter- Marseille - a one stop cure for Insomnia.  GOAL! BAYERN MUNICH 6 (six) -0 Basel (Gomez 67) (6-1 agg) It&apos;s Gomez again and it&apos;s absolutely brilliant from him and brilliant from Ribery, who has destroyed Steinhofer - he pulls it back to Gomez whose finish is unstoppable, rifled right into the top corner with his left foot./  9.13pm: Basel are bringing on the former Liverpool player Phillip Degen. That&apos;s not going to help. He replaces the hapless Steinhofer. Bastian Schweinsteiger comes on for Bayern to rapturous applause. &quot;After the five goals from Messi last week prompted the whole non-Madrid world to mention he&apos;s at least as good as Pele and Maradona, if Gomez does the same in this match will he at least be mentioned in the same breath as Gerd M\u00fcller?&quot; asks Jo\u00e3o Sousa Andr\u00e9. Probably not.  9.15pm: You wouldn&apos;t know it but this is extremely tense at the San Siro. Marseille nearly snatch the goal that would put the tie to bed. Valbuena&apos;s free kicks have been dangerous all night and it&apos;s another inswinging one from the left, Diawara rises and glances a header towards the bottom corner and it takes a fine stretching save from Julio Cesar to stop it creeping in.  9.17pm: In reply to Brian Russell (see 9:09pm) you can get the latest from Sheffield United here. Cambiasso comes on for Inter - that&apos;s Claudio Ranieri&apos;s final throw of the dice.  GOAL!! INTER 1-0 Marseille (Milito 75) (1-0 agg) Inter finally have the breakthrough after a goalmouth scramble where Marseille had ample opportunity to clear. It was a poor corner from Sneijder, Pazzini,had a stab at it and it fell into the path of Milito inside the six-yard box and he made no mistake.  9.23pm: Both Ribery and Shaqiri depart at the Allianz. Ribery has shown the young Swiss playmaker exactly what will be expected of him at Bayern next season.  GOAL! BAYERN MUNICH 7-0 Basel (7-1 agg) (Robben 81) What was that Heiko Vogel said about conceding seven? Well his worst fears have come true. Schweinsteiger threaded the most perfect through ball the the Dutchman who skipped past the advancing Sommer and rolled into the empty net. Bayern have now scored 14 goals in their past two games.  9.27pm: Micheal Meagher has pointed out that that Sneijder&apos;s poor corner which led to the Inter goal must have been some achievement seeing as he was substituted 20 minutes ago. He&apos;s an incredible player, that Sneijder.  9.29pm: Cambiasso has a great chance to put Inter through. Lucio cross takes a deflection and bounces in front of Cambiasso, who can&apos;t get over the ball to get any power in his header. But Inter are pushing for a winner - Maicon is brought down by Diarra on the edge of the area ...  9.31pm: ... but he blasts over the top. Travis Dudfield writes: &quot;&apos;Is it Ironic that one of the couldiest cities in the world insists on naming its newspaper The Vancouver Sun?&apos; - First, apologies for this gentleman&apos;s grammar. Second, Vancouver is not one of the coldest cities in the world. Does he not recall how we had to helicopter snow in for the Olympics a couple of years ago? As I stare out my office window I can blue sky, surrounded by a lot of cloud. I believe that the Vancouver Sun got its name out of a desire for MORE sunshine. But that is just a guess. But I would like to direct my fellow Vancouverite to Commercial Drive. Once he goes there he will find a number of establishments that would welcome him with open arms as he sips an espresso and watches the EPL, Serie A and La Liga on large screens surrounded by men who have more body hair than Robin Williams. That should tide him over until he turns 19.&quot;  9.33pm: RE: the mystery corner taker, both Eelco van de Stadt and Andrew Wiese suggest it was Cambiasso wot took it. I&apos;m not too sure - trying to do to MBMs at once is taking its toll - but make the point that Cambiasso and Sneijder are bald so it&apos;s an easy mistake. Don&apos;t let me off that easily.  Full time: Bayern Munich 7-0 Basel (7-1 agg). Oh dear.  GOAL! Inter 1-1 MARSEILLE (Brandao (90+1) (1-2 agg) Marseille are through and it&apos;s an absolute shambles from Inter&apos;s point of view. It&apos;s just a long ball upfield, Lucio and Samuel fail to deal with it, and the Brazilian turns Stankovic and fires a left-footed shot past Julio Cesar. So so simple but what were Inter playing at?  PENALTY TO INTER! Mandanda sent off for bringing down Pazzini. Inter need two to go through so this shouldn&apos;t make too much difference ...  GOAL! INTER 2-1 Marseille (Pazzini (90+3) (2-2 agg) Pazzini rifles it into thye top corner but it&apos;s the last kick of the game and Inter are out on away goal.  FULL TIME: Inter 2-1 Marseille (2-2 agg) Marseille win on away goals and reach the last eight for the first time since 1993.  9.42pm: What a finish in the San Siro. Marseille left it late in the first leg and they&apos;ve pulled off the same trick tonight. The game seemed set for extra-time, but some absolutely shambolic defending from Inter and a smart finish from the substitute Brandao and Marseille are through. Pazzini&apos;s penalty moments later was irrelevant save for the fact that it now means Mandanda will be suspended for the quarter final first leg. As will the excellent Diawara, who was booked and will also be absent. In Munich, Bayern coasted to a 7-0 victory over Basel. Yep, that&apos;s seven. Mario Gomez scored four. Thanks for all your emails. Sorry I couldn&apos;t publish them all. I&apos;ll leave you with the Basel manager, Heiko Vogel&apos;s, quote prior to tonight&apos;s game after Bayern had scored seven against Hoffenheim on Saturday: &quot;Quite clearly, it&apos;s an unusual result . But the margin of victory does not impress me. I have absolutely no fear that Bayern will score seven goals in one game [against us].&quot; Oh dear."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/mar/14/50-stunning-olympic-moments", "publicationDate": "2012-03-14T12:03:38Z", "tags": ["Sport", "Olympic Games"], "sentences": ["Both the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People\u2019s Republic of China (China) also withdrew, each because of problems with the other and the former so late in the day that their sailors were already on the water for the official opening of the regatta when they were beckoned back to land."], "title": "50 stunning Olympic moments No18: Boris Onischenko cheats, GB win gold | Simon Burnton", "article": "It is just as well that Nadia Comaneci turned up with her scoreboard-befuddling antics, because without her there would have been worryingly little good news to cheer in Montreal.   Related: Why Olympians shine under the spotlight    On the eve of the opening ceremony \u2013 a threatened strike by broadcasters having been seen off only the previous day \u2013 a torrential downpour sent water pouring into the velodrome through leaks in the roof, and so many people fainted during the ceremony\u2019s dress rehearsal that organisers were forced to distribute 14,000 salt tablets in an attempt to avoid a repeat on the big day. The bill for staging the Games \u2013 which escalated from an initial estimate of $124m to a final outlay of $1.5bn \u2013 took 30 years to pay off, finally being settled in December 2006. Canada became the first and so far only host nation not to win a single gold medal. The Games began with streams of athletes leaving the city, as all but two African nations eventually joined a last-minute boycott in protest at New Zealand, whose rugby side had just body-swerved a boycott to go on a tour of South Africa, being allowed to compete \u2013 \u201cunequivocally not our concern in any way,\u201d according to the IOC president, Lord Killanin. New nations were joining the protest even after the Games began, with officials often not finding out until only one boxer turned up to a bout, or just one team to a football match. Both the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People\u2019s Republic of China (China) also withdrew, each because of problems with the other and the former so late in the day that their sailors were already on the water for the official opening of the regatta when they were beckoned back to land. And then the Games began. 19 July, the second day of competition, started with the newspapers full of news of Comaneci\u2019s perfect 10. Finally it seemed that attention was starting to turn away from the politics and towards the action. By the day\u2019s end, though, the talk was only of one thing: the most infamous case of sporting skulduggery in Olympic history. Boris Onischenko was one of the modern pentathlon\u2019s star athletes. A three-times world champion and member of Russia\u2019s winning team in 1972, when he was an individual silver-medallist, he was, at 38, considered likely to leave his last Games with at least one further medal. After the equestrian events Russia\u2019s team lay fourth, with their best disciplines still to come, and Onischenko started the second day\u2019s fencing in thrilling style. In this part of the pentathlon, every athlete played each of the others in a round-robin competition, in what added up to 46 matches spread over a period of 12 hours. Each lasted three minutes, or until one of the contestants registered a hit, with an electronic scoreboard programmed to automatically detect when either blade found its mark. The aim was to win at least 70% of your matches, which would trigger a 1,000-point bonus, and after winning each of his first four Onischenko seemed very much on target. The Russians faced the Britons early in the day. First he easily beat Danny Nightingale \u2013 \u201cI was expecting to lose, he was a renowned fencer\u201d \u2013 and next up was Adrian Parker. \u201cOnischenko scored a hit, but we could not see how he managed it,\u201d recalled the British team manager, Mike Proudfoot, who suspected some kind of technical malfunction. \u201cWe called an official to look at the equipment. He inspected the piste and electrical equipment, but eventually awarded a hit.\u201d Officials put this complaint down to \u201cearly morning jitters\u201d. Onischenko\u2019s fifth match was against another Briton, the 36-year-old Jim Fox. Fox and his opponent were both military men and had been competing for the best part of two decades, during which time they had built up what the Englishman considered a decent friendship. During the match, Onischenko lunged towards his rival, and Fox leapt backwards to evade his blade. Although his evasive action was successful, the scoreboard lit up. \u201cIt was,\u201d said Fox, \u201clike waving a magic wand.\u201d \u201cBoris tried it on the wrong bloke with me,\u201d Fox added. \u201cI\u2019ve been around too long to fall for it. I was watching him when he fenced against Adrian Parker and thought he was a couple of inches short when a hit was scored. I was actually going away from him when the same thing happened to me. I said: \u2018Something is wrong here.\u2019 He said: \u2018Yes, I know I didn\u2019t hit you,\u2019 and tried to change his weapon. I wasn\u2019t having that, not because I thought he was cheating but because I thought the weapon was faulty and might be used again. I wanted it examined.\u201d Although for a while the Russians claimed to have lost it, when judges examined the \u00e9p\u00e9e in forensic detail they discovered, buried in the handle behind a layer of leather, a complex wiring system which, when a pressure pad was depressed, automatically told the sensors that a hit had been scored. \u201cIt was a real engineering job,\u201d said Proudfoot. \u201cNot just a ham amateur\u2019s effort. They had to dismantle the weapon to discover it.\u201d Carl Schwende, the chief of discipline for fencing, explained to the media that the offending \u00e9p\u00e9e had been \u201cdeliberately fabricated to show that he was winning when he was not\u201d. \u201cWe had no choice but to disqualify him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s out of the Olympics. The jury of appeal listened very carefully to Onischenko\u2019s explanation that the equipment was not his own, but decided that his explanation was not good enough.\u201d Sandor Kerekes, the Olympic pentathlon competition director, said: \u201cIt was a flagrant, deliberate manipulation with the weapon. It was like catching somebody with a smoking gun standing over a dead body.\u201d While the judges examined Onischenko\u2019s fiddled \u00e9p\u00e9e, the Russian was allowed to continue with a new, unbiased blade. During this period, he scored a perfectly respectable five wins and two losses. \u201cMake no mistake, he is a great fencer,\u201d said Fox. \u201cSuch terrible political pressures are put on competitors now. The need to win is too great for some people. I am absolutely shattered and so are all the Russians. We know them all well. We go drinking together. It\u2019s the land of sport, this is.\u201d When his ruse was revealed, Onischenko had swept from the hall, pausing only to say to Fox: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Perhaps, Fox was asked, at 38 \u2013 10 years older than the average age of his rivals \u2013 and having only just scraped into the Russian team for the Olympics, Onischenko felt under pressure to perform. \u201cI wonder if it preyed on his mind,\u201d he replied. \u201cI think it was pressure that caused it. But there is pressure on all of us, not just the eastern Europeans. It is getting out of hand. It is an absolute tragedy for Onischenko as well as for the Russian team, and for the whole sport.\u201d The case was viewed as further evidence of unsporting behaviour by Communist nations. In 1968, perhaps the closest the Olympics had come to this kind of scandal, the East German bobsleigh team were disqualified after being discovered taking a blow torch to their runners immediately before a race. A few days after this incident, the Associated Press would report that Russia had contacted other competing nations in an attempt to put in place an organised points-swapping exercise in the diving. East Germany\u2019s women swimmers, who hadn\u2019t won a single gold in 1972, hoovered up 11 out of a possible 13 in Montreal \u2013 Kornelia Ender, who won four of them, later confessed to nobody\u2019s great surprise that they had been receiving mysterious injections. But despite Onischenko\u2019s disqualification, his two team-mates were allowed to continue in the competition. Their hope of a team medal was over, but one of them, Pavel Lednev, went on to win individual silver. \u201cI am convinced that there is no question of it being planned by the Russians or the rest of the team being involved in any way at all,\u201d said Fox. \u201cI am 100% convinced that the rest of them had nothing to do with this.\u201d \u201cI know the coaches well and I don\u2019t think they had anything to do with it, but who can really say who\u2019s the culprit and who isn\u2019t?\u201d said Kerekes, a few days after the story broke. \u201cOnischenko was a nice comrade. I will never get over it. I haven\u2019t slept. I doubt if I will. To me, it\u2019s a tremendous shock as a sportsman. You know, Monday I was sitting back in my chair thinking about my responsibilities and saying, dammit, everything is going just beautifully. Then I get this bloody call and I can\u2019t believe it. For 20 years he has been such a tremendous athlete. Like wine, you know, he has got better with age. In the Soviet Union he is a hero, held up as an idol by the children. They have cards of him.\u201d As the western world delighted in Onischenko\u2019s downfall \u2013 the papers gleefully nicknamed him \u201cDisonischenko\u201d \u2013 the Russians had to work out what their version of the story should be. By coincidence, the Mail\u2019s Ian Wooldridge was in the Soviet delegation\u2019s offices in the Olympic village when the story broke and the phone started to ring: \u201c\u2019Cheating?\u2019 said the interpreter, glancing anxiously at his boss who was sitting directly under the five-foot portrait of a severe-looking Lenin. \u2018What event is this you are speaking of? Of this we know nothing. Our officials are all in a meeting. Please ring back tomorrow.\u2019 In fact, most of the officials were right there in the room, looking dead worried, as well they might. As hosts for the next Olympics in Moscow they have ducked all the recent political trouble and exercised uncustomary charm all over the place. The very last thing they wanted was to be caught fiddling the books or anything else for the sake of just another medal.\u201d That night, as Onischenko was collected from the athletes\u2019 village in a private car and taken to the airport, Russian radio reported only that Onischenko \u201cwas fencing with a sword that did not meet the requirements of international rules, so a disappointing mistake has occurred\u201d. But they knew that such pronouncements would not wash in the west. The following day, the Russian Modern Pentathlon Federation released a statement saying it \u201ccondemned this action by Boris Onischenko and expelled him from the team\u201d. In mid-afternoon a Soviet team spokesman confirmed that he was already \u201cback in his home town of Kiev\u201d. \u201cIt is a very sad matter and he will probably be stripped of all his medals and honours,\u201d he said. \u201cI am sure the matter will be investigated but I fear his career as a sportsman is over. The team did not know about it, and the trainers did not know about it. It is a tragedy for the entire team. These are not our methods.\u201d The distraction did little for Fox, whose own game fell apart. He won just 23 of his fencing contests; this was his fourth and final Olympics, and he had never done worse. \u201cI know I\u2019m finished, and now I\u2019ve finished the team, too,\u201d he told the Observer\u2019s David Hunn that evening. \u201cWhat a way to go out. They say it\u2019s character-building, this sport. It\u2019s a bastard.\u201d He set another low in the following day\u2019s shooting. With two events to go Britain lay eighth and seemed out of contention. What happened over the following two days must rank as one of the most remarkable successes in British Olympic history. In the 300m swim Fox equalled his personal best, while Parker and Nightingale smashed theirs to lift Britain up to fifth. On the morning of the final event, a 4,000m cross-country race that was to start and end in the Olympic Stadium but was mainly to be run over the municipal golf course next door, there was some quiet optimism. \u201cIt\u2019s our best event and we should end up quite well,\u201d said one coach that morning. The event was brutal, and the glamorous \u201cOlympic hostesses\u201d positioned at the finish to greet the athletes and offer them a drink wept openly as one by one the competitors collapsed across the line in a human shower of limbs, sweat and vomit. \u201cIt was awful, just horrible,\u201d said one later, bursting back into tears. When sense was made of this scene, it was discovered that the British \u2013 who would of course have had an even more remote chance of success had Russia still been involved \u2013 were indeed the winners. \u201cAlthough we had estimated that victory was possible it meant we all had to run as we have never done before \u2013 and on the same day,\u201d said Fox. \u201cIt really is incredible that we pulled it off.\u201d Two months later word reached the west of Onischenko\u2019s fate. He had been called before Leonid Brezhnev himself for a personal rollicking, dismissed from the Red Army, fined 5,000 roubles, stripped of all his sporting honours, and was now working as a taxi driver in Kiev. Nothing has been heard of him since. What the Guardian said Tuesday 20 July 1976 A Russian fencer alleged to have cheated in the modern pentathlon was expelled from the Olympic Games yesterday after officials discovered his weapon was wired to score a hit without touching his opponent. In an astonishing incident that destroyed the Soviet Union\u2019s chances of repeating their Munich gold medal win in the event, 38-year-old Boris Onischenko was found to have a piece of wire concealed on his \u00e9p\u00e9e to trigger the electronic scoring machine. He was fighting Britain\u2019s Jim Fox in the second round of the fencing when he took a lunge at his tall, fair-haired opponent. The Briton stepped back without being touched \u2013 and stood amazed as a light signalled the Russian has scored a hit. Fox, 24, lodged an immediate protest and officials launched an investigation. It ended with the expulsion of Onischenko, a Munich silver medallist who has been a member of the Soviet Olympic team for 10 years. Onischenko, who was later whisked away in a Soviet team coach, denied that the offending weapon was his. But Olympic officials decided his explanation was not good enough. Carl Schwende, chief of discipline in charge of fencing, said: \u201cThe weapon had definitely been tampered with. Someone had wired it in such a way that it would score a winning hit without even making contact.\u201d The British squad\u2019s manager, Mike Proudfoot, said they suspected that all was not well after their first bout against the Russians. \u201cOnischenko scored a hit against Adrian Parker in the first fight and we could not see how he managed it,\u201d Proudfoot said. \u201cWe called over an official to look at the equipment. He inspected the piste and electrical equipment but eventually awarded the hit. Then Jim Fox met the Russian and the same thing happened. This time it was more obvious than ever that it could not have been a hit, and we asked for the \u00e9p\u00e9e to be looked at.\u201d Fox said: \u201cIt was a silly thing to do and I\u2019m very sorry it should have happened because we are such good friends. But I am surprised that he should think he could get away with it.\u201d Wednesday 21 July 1976 Boris Onischenko\u2019s disqualification was another blow for the image of modern pentathlon. At Munich, 14 competitors in the event were found to have taken a stimulant. In 1968, at Mexico City in the days before drug tests, a Swede was found to have encouraged himself to pass its severe tests of all-round skill with alcohol. But Onischenko\u2019s breach of the rules is far more damaging. Here was a Russian grand master of sport, aged 38, an army major, the secretary-general of the Russian Pentathlon Federation, twice national champion, a silver medallist in 1972, and a member of the national team which won the gold medal in Munich, caught using an electrical device which enabled him to register \u201cfalse\u201d hits in the fencing competition. If his \u00e9p\u00e9e had been wired normally a light would have flashed every time he touched an opponent, but apparently Onischenko added an extra wire to the circuit. This was controlled by a thumb button hidden under the usual leather binding so that it was impossible to detect by those who checked his weapons. Onischenko was the favourite. What bewilders all his fellow competitors is that he is such a skilled fencer that he would have had no need to use artificial help to win the point he needed. Carl Schwende (Canada), the fencing chef de discipline, said: \u201cThis was deliberately fabricated to show that he was winning when he was not. We had no choice but to disqualify him.\u201d Russia have accepted that Onischenko was guilty of cheating and announced he had been expelled from the team in disgrace. In an unusually prompt response to the incident, the Russian Pentathlon Federation \u201cacknowledged\u201d that Onischenko had broken the rules: \u201cThe USSR Modern Pentathlon Federation condemned this action by B Onischenko and expelled him from the national team,\u201d an official federation statement said. Jim Fox, the British Army sergeant from Portsmouth, who made the complaint against the Russian, was more upset than anyone by the incident. Onischenko had said this would be his last Olympics. Fox had known him for 14 years. \u201cMake no mistake. He is a great fencer. This is a catastrophe for modern pentathlon, for Onischenko, and for Russia. The sport is gone because such terrible political pressures are put on competitors now. The need to win is too great for some people.\u201d After the Games Fox said that Onischenko had expected to be promoted to lieutenant-colonel and to a high position in the administration of Russian sport. \u201cI am absolutely shattered and so are all the Russians. We know them all well. We go drinking together. It\u2019s the kind of sport this is.\u201d   Related: Ten to watch: meet Team GB's sporting superheroes    After the complaint Fox himself fenced erratically and had one or two small arguments with the judges. During the two and a half hours that Onischenko\u2019s case was being considered, the Russian, disciplined and impassive, fenced on with another weapon and won five of his seven bouts. The Modern Pentathlon Council will meet tomorrow to discuss the matter. Onischenko\u2019s wiring trick isn\u2019t unknown in fencing. It is one of the sport\u2019s familiar practical jokes. Imre Nagy, a member of the Canadian team is quoted as saying yesterday: \u201cA guy would rig his weapon and beat someone else in friendly competition. After it was all over, he would say that it was a gag. In international competition, especially in the Olympics, this sort of thing is unheard of. This is no joke. It is incredible to think that such a great athlete would resort to such tactics.\u201d Like everyone else, Nagy feels that this has undermined the whole concept of sportsmanship in fencing. \u201cIt is a sad day when we know that stricter controls will have to be taken in an electronically operated sport.\u201d A month ago Onischenko won a fencing competition by a large margin. There were those who were wondering about that success in Montreal yesterday. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 March 2012. The original referred to Onischenko\u2019s weapon as a sabre and subsequently as a foil. This has been corrected."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2012/mar/15/lifecycle-carbon-footprint-bike-blog", "publicationDate": "2012-03-15T12:43:57Z", "tags": ["Cycling", "Fitness", "Life and style", "Waste", "Environment", "Carbon footprints", "Ethical and green living", "Climate change"], "sentences": ["With a few high-end exceptions, like Brompton for example, most frames are made in the far east: China and Taiwan mainly, and some in Vietnam and Cambodia.", "The tubing is Dedacciai, which was almost certainly made in Taiwan, according to Cory Blackwood at Kona.", "Other parts could come from all over, says Blackwood, including the US where some high-end parts are made, but they must be shipped to Taiwan for assembly.", "The specialized carbon forks, bespoke to my bike, are likely to come from Taiwan too, though at the time of writing the company had still not responded to my inquiry.", "Cycling behemoth Giant is included, with the majority of its parts made in Taiwan, with some shipped over from origins in Europe for assembly in the Taiwanese factory."], "title": "Examining the lifecycle of a bike \u2013 and its green credentials | Kat Austen", "article": "When it comes to emissions from cycling, the carbon dioxide that comes out of your average pair of lungs is far less than that of a car or bus. But with so many more bikes on the road these days, where do they all come from \u2013 and how much does the environmental impact of making and disposing of them affect how green they are? To know this, we have to look at the lifecycle of the bike. From the point that the raw materials are dug, or pumped in the case of oil for tyres&apos; synthetic rubber, out of the ground \u2013 to the point when the bike and parts reach the end of their lives. That&apos;s why I am running a workshop on Saturday at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas 2012 where I&apos;ll be talking more about the life of the bicycle. Through the lens of constructing a piece of art out of salvaged bike parts, we&apos;ll be discussing what we know \u2013 and what we don&apos;t \u2013 about where bikes come from and where they end up. It turns out that little is transparent in the manufacture of bike parts. With a few high-end exceptions, like Brompton for example, most frames are made in the far east: China and Taiwan mainly, and some in Vietnam and Cambodia. But the supply chain is often obscured by the fact that bike brands change their suppliers between models. In fact, finding a company that tells you the location of its factory is a rare treat, and while high-end bespoke manufacturers might be happy to tell you the provenance of your pedal-pusher, mass manufacturers rarely are. I tried to track down the provenance of my own Kona Paddy Wagon from 2007, in the hope that specificity might be the key to getting some answers. The tubing is Dedacciai, which was almost certainly made in Taiwan, according to Cory Blackwood at Kona. The tubes would have been then cut and welded together in the Kona factory in Hodaka, then shipped out. Other parts could come from all over, says Blackwood, including the US where some high-end parts are made, but they must be shipped to Taiwan for assembly. Kona refreshingly make no secret of this, transparently stating on their website that &quot;it is almost impossible to get even half the parts on a bike from one country&quot;. The specialized carbon forks, bespoke to my bike, are likely to come from Taiwan too, though at the time of writing the company had still not responded to my inquiry. But where would the steel have come from? Emissions from producing steel should not be ignored \u2013 the World Steel Association states that approximately 1.9 tonnes of carbon dioxide is produced for every tonne of steel, so a fairly light frame is still going to be responsible for over 5kg of CO2, even before it is manufactured into tubes, welded into shape or shipped. Using recycled steel might help, but according to Leo Bonanni, the founder of sourcemap.com \u2013 a site that provides crowdsourced or company-seeded maps to show where your goods have come from \u2013 finding out the source of raw materials is difficult. &quot;Given how many countries iron is mined in and the use of recycled ore, it is virtually impossible to track the source or steel, unlike more precious metals,&quot; he says. What it would take, he continues, is co-operation from the companies involved. Sourcemap hosts only a couple of maps pertaining to bikes. Cycling behemoth Giant is included, with the majority of its parts made in Taiwan, with some shipped over from origins in Europe for assembly in the Taiwanese factory. Cube was more transparent with its map, even showing where the manganese and copper were sourced for some of their parts. With information like this you could work out not just the carbon, but pollution too. Of course it&apos;s not just the origin of the bike that will have an environmental impact, it&apos;s the way we dispose of cycling waste too. I make artworks out of old cycles, and in sourcing parts for my work I&apos;ve come into contact with a lot of different cycle shops with different attitudes to disposing of their waste. Lock 7 near Broadway Market in east London ensures that everything from its environmentally savvy operation gets recycled \u2013 even the dilapidated tyres get mashed up and mixed with asphalt, owner Kathryn Burgess told me as she let me rifle through their bins. When I approached my local branch of cycle shop chain Cycle Surgery, I was told: &quot;We recycle as much as we can, but we don&apos;t have the resources&quot;. At least we know where some small fraction of London&apos;s discarded bikes end up: once we&apos;ve made the artwork on Saturday it will provide the endpoint for a sourcemap. As far as they can be identified, I will be tracing the origins of the various components, using crowdsourcing, Bonanni and any manufacturers who believe that transparency is the best way to win public approbation. The future for green cycling surely is for us all to know a bit more about the bikes we consume and how best to dispose of them once they have served us so well."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/17/globizness-world-celebrity", "publicationDate": "2012-03-17T00:04:00Z", "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture", "Celebrity"], "sentences": ["Photograph: Chinafotopress/Getty Images    Also looking to beef up his macho credentials is Ethan Ruan, Taiwan&apos;s most popular acting totty, who joined the military last month.", "Ruan, 29, isn&apos;t going method though \u2013 12 months of national service is mandatory in Taiwan, a fact he managed to avoid until now because of &quot;back problems&quot; and the old classic, &quot;flat feet&quot;."], "title": "Globizness: our round-up of celebrity scandal around the world", "article": "PAKISTAN Veena Malik is officially auditioning for a husband.

GHANA     Mzbel.    What to do when you&apos;re a pop star stood accused of running over a traffic cop in your Mitsubishi 4x4, then beating him up for good measure afterward? If you&apos;re Mzbel, Ghana&apos;s answer to Ke$ha, the options seem obvious: sit pretty on The One Show sofa (west Africa edition). Or, alternatively, channel the whole nasty business into a new comeback track and call it (Get Off) My Bonnet. Starring a fake cop being violently thrown off your car. Take that, pigs! Being a bit image savvy about these things, Mzbel (real name Nana Ekuah Amoah) has decided to do both. According to news reports, the musician and two male pals last summer left a policeman &quot;hooked dangerously on the bonnet&quot; of Mzbel&apos;s car, the man being driven some distance before being thrown off. The Ghanian press claimed that Mzbel then attempted to slap and strangle the officer. All nonsense, says the Mzbel PR machine this spring; just a traffic violation blown out of proportion. True, the 32-year-old was arrested and held in a cell for a weekend and the case was splashed all over the papers, but why worry over the boring details? After all, &quot;no matter how long we have traveled on the wrong road, we can always turn round&quot;, as Mzbel tweeted (without irony) earlier this month.

As the sun glances through the windows of his Marylebone office, the man who has made a success of a\u00a0magazine, of a printed product at a\u00a0time of media crisis, begins to talk. He starts to ramble, so I interrupt, saying that I&apos;m disappointed, that I was expecting something pithy. Br\u00fbl\u00e9, who at 43 has real physical presence, a\u00a0gift from his American-football-playing father, looks aghast and for a moment his raw competitiveness shows. He struggles for the right line: &quot;People need to attend to details,&quot; he says at last. &quot;I believe in a\u00a0tidy ship. No jackets on the backs of chairs.&quot; I like Br\u00fbl\u00e9. You&apos;d have to be po-faced (or, the sceptics say, know him well) not to. He&apos;s an original. Nearly 20 years ago, an editor I know told me that in him she&apos;d found her perfect glossy-magazine foreign correspondent: &quot;He&apos;s not scared of war, and he knows a good pair of trousers.&quot; The Br\u00fbl\u00e9 myth began shortly afterwards when he was twice shot while in Afghanistan. He had a\u00a0conversion on a hospital bed, less Damascene and more Mayfairean. He thought about what really mattered to him \u2013 and it was friends, a\u00a0nice house and travelling. Since then he has turned this vision \u2013 himself \u2013 into two successful businesses. He went on to found Wallpaper* and, subsequently, Monocle. His assistant walks in and asks whether I\u00a0would like &quot;some baumkuchen from Germany?&quot; Br\u00fbl\u00e9 breaks in: &quot;Actually it&apos;s from Japan. It&apos;s one of those things that you&apos;d now be hard pressed to find in Germany, but the Japanese have gone nuts for it.&quot; Of course, Br\u00fbl\u00e9 knows I\u00a0will write about this. Self-awareness is what he does. Art directing his life, his style is his business model. The baumkuchen is delicious, like an aspirational Swiss roll. Wallpaper*, with its tagline &quot;The stuff that surrounds you&quot;, was the epitome of urban dreaming. The magazine baumkuchened up the idea of Homes &amp; Gardens, and in 1997, a year after he founded it, Time Inc bought it for a\u00a0reported $1.63m. For several years, Br\u00fbl\u00e9 lived the corporate life, but it didn&apos;t suit him and he says now: &quot;We&apos;ve seen the creep of the consultant on to the editorial floor \u2013 and that brought on a certain crisis of confidence.&quot; When, inevitably, he fell out with the Americans, a noncompete clause saw him branch out into consultancy with Winkreative, where he has brought his taste to bear on everything from Swissair to the country of Taiwan. But as soon as the legal restrictions fell away, Br\u00fbl\u00e9 went back into magazines, founding Monocle. A\u00a0compendium of global, newsy nuggets with a furious aversion to celebrity, it wanders from Saudi arms deals to fashion shoots in Tokyo barber shops, all leavened with an obsessive fascination with aviation. It is about the infrastructure of living internationally. It earnestly, if wittily, wants us to enjoy our planes, our hotels, our metro transportation systems. But it&apos;s never going to advise you to kick off all your clothes and jump into the nearest stream. Br\u00fbl\u00e9 says he&apos;s selling more than 70,000 copies of Monocle at \u00a36 each. According to ABC, who audit these things, 11,000 sell at newsstands and 2,000 by subscription in the UK, while the rest go abroad. Last year he founded a 24-hour digital radio station which seems to want to be a\u00a0baumkuchened-up Radio 4 and although it has not yet achieved anything like the depth, you can hear the aspiration. Add a\u00a0biannual newspaper and a\u00a0global chain of shops selling the accessories for a Monocle-based life, and you get a picture of the Br\u00fbl\u00e9 empire. It&apos;s all based on a philosophy that runs counter to prevailing thought in the media. &quot;It didn&apos;t make sense to us to give away our journalism for free. But we did have to think: &apos;How do we add value online?&apos; We started with video then it became radio, but it couldn&apos;t replicate what we were doing in print.&quot; Br\u00fbl\u00e9 leads me down to the morning conference. Everyone has just returned from a fifth birthday party in Budapest (they have also celebrated with their subscribers in Tokyo, Seoul, Berlin and are on their way to New York). In the meeting, they spend much of their time discussing the various airlines they&apos;ve used. There is an echo of a\u00a0male fascination with giving directions \u2013 Monocle meetings seem to play on this geeky joy. Back in his office, I ask Br\u00fbl\u00e9 who would be his perfect reader. He pulls out his mobile. &quot;This email just came in. &apos;I am a\u00a021-year-old studying economics and government in Australia. I have not achieved the means to live by the majority of the magazine&apos;s ideas, I&apos;m simply writing to thank you for the wealth of, for lack of a better word, awesomeness of the magazine.&apos; Now would I go to an advertising meeting and talk about that being the core reader, maybe not, but then I\u00a0would as well because here is someone who is going to be with us for a long time, who is part of a different media generation.&quot; Br\u00fbl\u00e9 is half Estonian, but was raised in Canada. &quot;I grew up in a variety of cities from Ottawa to Montreal to Toronto, in an era before the invasion of US channels across the border. From an early age I was dazzled by the big nightly newscasts and I always wanted to stay up late and see these men and women broadcast from around the world. In parallel, I grew up in a\u00a0magazine household, whether it was Forbes or my mother&apos;s decorating magazines. And when I\u00a0visited my Estonian relatives \u2013 people who had fled Germany \u2013 there were always copies of Stern and Spiegel. Also there was a\u00a0certain gruesomeness in the German reportage. It was all incredibly exciting to me.&quot; Into this is incorporated the painfully modern aesthetic that infuriates so many. Those programmes on his radio station and the section titles in his magazine reflect the man. He is an urbanist, he is absolutely a globalist, and he likes to speak from the perspective of seat 1A of the intercontinental jetliner. From there Br\u00fbl\u00e9 finds himself first despairing of innovation in his adopted country. &quot;There is so much international talent in London \u2013 architects, graphic design \u2013 but it&apos;s all despite itself, not because the government and private sector get together to celebrate it. It happens because of the natural forces, that we&apos;re English language, that we&apos;re in the EU. You can&apos;t just rock up in New York as an Austrian and get a job in graphic design, but you can here.&quot; So would he move the his business out? &quot;We&apos;ve had this discussion. The question is where. That&apos;s the curse of it all. The government thinking: &apos;Where would these media companies go?&apos; I\u00a0mean, we&apos;re not going to go to France.&quot; What about Scandinavia? After all, Monocle is forever claiming Copenhagen or Helsinki is the best place in the world to live. Br\u00fbl\u00e9 looks aghast, revealing the conflict between aesthete and businessman. &quot;The Scandis are a\u00a0bit too socialist.&quot; He swings his hand around the office. &quot;Everything in this room is from Scandinavia, but the maternity leave would kill us.&quot; So Copenhagen may be the best place to live in Br\u00fbl\u00e9&apos;s world, but it is no place to run a business. We&apos;re winding down. Don&apos;t you get bored of flying, I ask. &quot;I&apos;m moving to grand tours rather than there and backs.&quot; Your partner must hate it. &quot;He travels with me a lot.&quot; Any plans for children? A strangled laugh. &quot;Not yet.&quot; (Pity, his rigorous aesthetic would be a hoot on Mumsnet.) Br\u00fbl\u00e9 gives me a tour of the studios, separate floors dedicated to magazine, radio and consultancy. It is like a cool architectural practice run by a cult. He has told me: &quot;Everyone needs to be on the same page \u2013 I&apos;m not a huge fan of creative conflict.&quot; It&apos;s supposed to be cuddly, but comes across as slightly scary. Nonetheless, it makes sense because a good answer to my original question is that a publication&apos;s success usually rests on readers buying into a\u00a0singular vision. That&apos;s certainly true in Br\u00fbl\u00e9&apos;s case, and the view is absolutely from behind those thick-framed glasses. As he walks me into the crisp sunshine, I\u00a0can&apos;t stop myself messing with the show he&apos;s put on. &quot;Tyler, there was someone in there with their jacket on the back of their seat.&quot; He looks momentarily crestfallen and mutters something about people on work experience. The next day I tell this story to one of his staff. &quot;Oh that&apos;s why that guy was fired,&quot; he jokes. At least I hope he was joking."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/18/trailer-trash-film-on-rocks", "publicationDate": "2012-03-18T00:02:05Z", "tags": ["Apichatpong Weerasethakul", "Tilda Swinton", "Film", "Culture"], "sentences": ["A diverse selection of guests included British director Joanna Hogg (if she were looking for new material, after Unrelated and Archipelago, to skewer certain middle-class types on their holidays, she was in the right spot), Taiwan&apos;s Tsai Ming-liang, indie darling Chlo\u00eb Sevigny (who was adorned with a smattering of pale, skinny boys who would often be heard uttering what for me became the festival&apos;s catchphrase: &quot;I&apos;m just hanging out with Chloe&quot; \u2013 should be printed on T-shirts, that one), Dazed founder Jefferson Hack, film-maker Gregg Araki, New York MoMa curator Josh Siegel and Thailand&apos;s Rirkrit Tiravanija."], "title": "Trailer trash", "article": "Realm of the Six Senses Film festivals come in all themes and sizes and give prizes from Golden Bears to Audience Awards \u2013 but if there were an award for the world&apos;s most exclusive, it would surely go to Film on the Rocks, inaugurated and curated by Tilda Swinton and Palme d&apos;Or winner Apichatpong Weerasethakul last week at the blissful Six Senses resort on Koh Yao Noi, a tiny island off Phuket in Thailand. I&apos;m not really sure what it was I just attended in the line of journalistic duty \u2013 &quot;Castaways,&quot; Swinton called the assembled guests. &quot;Not quite a festival but a mind orgy,&quot; preferred Apichatpong (a national hero following his 2010 win at Cannes with Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives).

However, here, she coaxed together a programme of arty shorts and rarities, all screened in the most beautiful locations. &quot;Taking cinema back to its roots,&quot; she told me, just as she had done when she and Mark Cousins pulled a mobile cinema in a bus around Scottish towns. Empire state of mind Part of the festival&apos;s ethos was to show films in &quot;primordial&quot; locations, which turned out to be as spectacular as it was folly. It began, for example, with a &quot;conceptual screening&quot;, which we all attended deep in the island forest by a 300ft high tree. Musician Arto Lindsay had recorded jungle sounds to play out, and Rirkrit T brought a projector and reels in a huge trunk, which lay on the forest floor, pointed toward a makeshift screen but never shown. &quot;What\u00a0film&apos;s in the box?&quot; I asked innocently. It was the full 10 reels of Andy Warhol&apos;s eight-hour rarity Empire, flown in from New York and boated out to this jungle, just for, well, the hell of it. Alice meets Coltrane Before the festival, Swinton had urged guests to share creative inspirations and bring with them a &quot;message in a bottle&quot;. My choice was \u2013 unbeknown to me until I got there \u2013 accorded a centrepiece slot. The BFI Archive had lent me a digitally restored copy of Cecil Hepworth&apos;s 1903 Alice in Wonderland , which screened in an island lagoon, on a raft designed by architect Ole Scheeren. I gave a brief introduction to the work but I was unprepared for how ethereal and wondrous it would look. It helped that, following a monsoon that threatened to nix the event that afternoon, I decided to change the restoration&apos;s score (no offence to composer Wendy Hiscocks, whose &quot;Jill in the Box&quot; is the official accompaniment), instead playing John Coltrane&apos;s &quot;After the Rain&quot;, which echoed across the waters and around the cliffs, over images of Alice following the White Rabbit into another world. If that weren&apos;t enough, musician Simon Fisher Turner then gave an improvised live accompaniment to Paramount&apos;s 1924 Peter Pan, supported by electronic wizardry and a local drummer. It was, without doubt, one\u00a0of the best nights of my movie-going life."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/mar/22/jeremy-lin-tim-tebow-new-york", "publicationDate": "2012-03-22T12:00:00Z", "tags": ["NBA", "US sports", "Sport", "New York Jets", "New York Knicks", "Phoenix Suns"], "sentences": ["It would be a win-win for both of the leagues: The NFL would spread its brand to China/Taiwan and the NBA would spread its brand to devout Americans turned off by the NBA&apos;s &quot;urban&quot; appeal."], "title": "Don't Free Steve Nash and New York is home to Jeremy Lin and Tim Tebow", "article": "March Madness is one of the greatest sporting events of the year, but despite the late-game drama and radical upsets of the NCAA Men&apos;s College Basketball Tournament, the pageant makes a NBA fan appreciative of the level of play at the pros. The average NBA game, assuming it&apos;s not one between, say, the Toronto Raptors and the Sacramento Kings, features fewer scoring droughts, smarter plays and an exponentially higher level of athletic competition. Also, NBA players tend to be paid more than their college equivalents (depending on the particular school of course). With that in mind, here&apos;s what was happening while your brackets devolved into birdcage lining. 1. The trade deadline was boringly eventful March 15 came and went, and, behold, Dwight Howard remained with the Orlando Magic. In fact, after countless changes of heart, Howard also eventually agreed to not exercise the opt-out of his contract that would make him a free agent this summer. As feared, this means that next deadline, trade talk speculation might loom again around the Orlando center and he could subject us all to The Indecision Round II. This year they almost gave Dwight Howard full rights to fire the manager if he agreed to stay, I assume next go-around, they will give him the opportunity to be Orlando&apos;s mayor for life. In any case, better luck next year to the soon-to-be Brooklyn Nets. Now just because Dwight Howard ended up remaining with his team, as did the Boston Celtics&apos; Rajon Rondo and the Los Angeles Lakers&apos; Pau Gasol, doesn&apos;t mean that the trade deadline was completely uneventful. Here we&apos;ll list some of the more impactful deals that came in before the 3PM deadline. Although none of these moves were blockbusters, or even block-nudgers, they do hint at the future of their respective clubs. \u2022 In a season where several of their players broke down on their watch, it&apos;s no surprise that the Portland Trail Blazers decided it was time to break down the team itself. The Blazers parted ways with Gerald Wallace (who went to the New Jersey Nets) and Marcus Camby (shipped to the Houston Rockets). The Blazers also cut team mascot Greg Oden, whose ability to look fantastic while wearing a suit on the sidelines will always be a lasting memory for Portland basketball fans. \u2022 The Washington Wizards traded way JaVale McGee (the Human Lowlight Reel) in a deal to get power forward Nen\u00ea and his hefty contract from the Denver Nuggets.  \u2022 The Los Angeles Lakers shipped off long time mainstay Derek Fisher, trading him to the Houston Rockets (who promptly waived the veteran), leaving Kobe Bryant to find another best friend on the team who will never visit his house. The Lakers also traded Jason Kapono, Luke Walton and a first-round pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Ramon Sessions, Christian Eyenga and the Relief of Not Carrying Luke Walton on the Roster Anymore.  \u2022 In a fairly badass move, the Oklahoma City Thunder did absolutely nothing on the deadline because they believed they had the roster to win it all this year. At least the Thunder believed this until Wednesday, when they picked up the waived Derek Fisher (which, in some technical sense of the word, counts as something more than &quot;nothing&quot;). \u2022 In the words of Jason Kirk of SB Nation, the Atlanta Hawks made the most Atlanta Hawks trade ever.  Okay, so it wasn&apos;t the most exciting trade deadline for all but diehard NBA fans, in the end the biggest move that happened near the deadline involved a coach (the Knicks&apos; Mike D&apos;Antoni). Still, it will be interesting to see how the Portland Trail Blazers rebuild or what exactly the Wizards are trying to accomplish with a core of John Wall and Nen\u00ea. Well, at least marginally interesting. 2. An open letter to NYC regarding Tim Tebow and Jeremy Lin Dear New York City, I know that I&apos;ve spent a lot of time making fun of your sports teams in the past, but since I just visited you and had quite a good time, I decided to return the favor and help out two of your teams. I just learned that the Denver Broncos have traded young quarterback Tim Tebow to your Jets, and was somewhat confused: Don&apos;t the Jets already have a better lousy quarterback who can somehow pull off fourth quarter victories in Mark Sanchez? This seems like a bit of an overlap. It sounds like I&apos;m knocking one of your teams again, New York City, but it&apos;s not like that. I&apos;m just saying that this is why the New York Jets, who are used to missing out on the playoffs by one or two games, should use Tim Tebow as a trading chip to get someone who has been proven to provide a much needed temporary spark for a few games. Obviously I&apos;m referring to New York Knicks&apos; point guard Jeremy Lin. Now the rules don&apos;t officially allow trades between the NBA and the NFL, but I&apos;m not entirely sure that they explicitly disallow it. Whatever, I&apos;m sure something can be worked out underneath the table. It would be a win-win for both of the leagues: The NFL would spread its brand to China/Taiwan and the NBA would spread its brand to devout Americans turned off by the NBA&apos;s &quot;urban&quot; appeal.  As far as the teams involved go? Well, Jeremy Lin certainly would have a better completion ratio than Tebow, even if he doesn&apos;t have his deep ball. Yes, Lin&apos;s tendency to turn over the ball in the NBA could carry over into the NFL, but the Jets are already okay with Sanchez&apos;s interception rates, Lin couldn&apos;t be much worse. Meanwhile, Tebow could provide the Knicks with the high-quality leadership the team needs to keep Carmelo Anthony and Amar&apos;e Stoudemire on the same page, or at least in the same section of the library. As far as drawbacks, I will admit this: Despite his obvious leadership qualities, I&apos;m not sure if Tim Tebow is a natural point guard, he seems to be more of a forward quite honestly. Would he be open for a position change? Just think my proposal over for a bit. Sincerely,Hunter Felt P.S. \u2013 If Tebow to the Knicks doesn&apos;t work out, the New York Mets are certainly looking to dump outfielder Jason Bay&apos;s salary and Tebow is cheaper. (Save that idea until the baseball season - ed) 3. The Suns rise in the West The &quot;Free Steve Nash&quot; moment has hit a snag, namely that, out of nowhere, the Phoenix Suns are (as of this writing) just two games out of a playoff spot. When it seemed that Steve Nash, accompanied by fellow elder statesman Grant Hill, was doomed to play out the end of his career for a fading former contender, fans and media commentators alike were openly hoping that the loyal Nash would demand a trade to a playoff team or that the Suns ownership were able to grow the stones to take the PR hit and actively shop him themselves. Instead Nash and the Suns stayed together and the Suns are this close to one more shot at playoff glory. Steve Nash is a first ballot Hall of Famer, one of the most enjoyable players to watch in modern times, as well as a model citizen off the court. The worst that can be said about Nash is that he&apos;s too preachy about nutrition. Couple that with the fact that he probably has about two years left of above-average play and provides the leadership intangibles that NBA coaches drool over, it&apos;s no wonder that other teams covet Steve Nash even during his twilight campaign.  Part of the &quot;Free Steve Nash&quot; movement is the not-so-secret desire for fans to see him on their postseason-bound team. Grant Hill is also an easy player to root for. The former Pistons forward was one of the best players of the &apos;90s, and the greatest Sprite pitchman who ever lived, until his HOF-bound career was seemingly ended by a non-stop barrage of injuries. After making a comeback in his late thirties, Hill has revealed few regrets about how his career has turned out: &quot;If I had played those years&quot;, he told Dan Patrick, &quot;I would have [lost the desire]\u2026 I still have that itch and I&apos;m running around after guys half my age.&quot; With these two likeable veterans at their core, this Suns team is difficult to root against, unless you&apos;re a San Antonio Spurs fan. 4. Kobe Bryant has been having a rough few days On Sunday, Los Angeles Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant had a bad night. As often happens when Kobe has a bad night, the Lakers lost, this time to the Utah Jazz to the tune of 103-99. The Lakers losing is not news, but the Lakers losing due to a 3-20 shooting performance by Kobe Bryant, the league&apos;s scoring leader, is worrisome. The Lakers went on to lose their next game, against the Houston Rockets who overcame a late 12 point deficit to steal a 107-104 win. Get ready to hear the rumors, I&apos;m sure they&apos;re already out there, that Bryant is still adjusting to the loss of longtime teammate Derek Fisher. When guard Ramon Sessions, basically Fisher&apos;s replacement, began taking over the game late, scoring on four straight possessions, Bryant responded by going into &quot;game takeover&quot; mode. The move backfired on the Lakers, as Bryant ended up missing three straight shots and allowing a steal during two minutes of game time, effectively handing Houston the victory. Keep in mind that these back to back losses came after a five game winning streak and nobody, not even his biggest critics, expect Kobe&apos;s scoring to be a long-term problem. Kobe Bryant&apos;s attitude towards his team, on the other hand, is always a major wild card when it comes to the success of the Lakers. The Lakers have a slim enough opportunity to reach the NBA Finals this year as it is, the team doesn&apos;t need another burst of Kobe petulance. Previous Lakers teams have risen above this sort of drama to make championship runs, but those teams were better run and younger than this older team adapting to a new coach in Mike Brown. Right now the Lakers are more equipped to shop a reality show than win a title. 5. Other things we&apos;ve learned \u2022 An article by Sports Illustrated sheds some light in Antoine Walker&apos;s depressing attempt to return to the big leagues.  \u2022 Blake Griffin continues to be a goldmine for viral video. First he memorably airballs two straight free throw attempts and then, a week later, he knocks over a fan&apos;s concessions. The Los Angeles Clippers need to seriously look into drafting Michigan State&apos;s Draymond Green just to clean up after their star forward. * The Golden State Warriors fanbase really doesn&apos;t like their owner. I mean really doesn&apos;t. Monta Ellis has a posse it seems.  \u2022 The Memphis Grizzlies have signed former Washington Wizard Gilbert Arenas, presumably he will primarily be used as a shooting guard. No, I will never stop using this gag until Arenas is out of basketball. \u2022 This is my vote for Dunk of the Week, courtesy of the New jersey Nets&apos; Deron Williams, although feel free to nominate your own favorite in the comments below."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/22/1", "publicationDate": "2012-03-22T15:04:08Z", "tags": ["Environment"], "sentences": ["Giant Manufacturing, once an obscure contractor, now adds a new bike factory somewhere in the world every few years while working feverishly at its Taiwan base to meet rising demand for the body-building, gas-saving vehicles."], "title": "Green news roundup: Chinese solar, fish discards and badger cull", "article": "Environment news \u2022 US to impose tariff on Chinese solar panels in victory for domestic makers\u2022 Norway leads calls for EU ban on fish discards\u2022 Keystone XL pipeline: Obama to oil progress as pump prices rise\u2022 Tennessee bill protects teachers who challenge evolution and climate change\u2022 Badger cull in Wales scrapped for vaccination programme\u2022 India may urge airlines to boycott EU carbon scheme Budget 2012     Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne holds up his red Ministerial Box outside 11 Downing Street before heading to the House of Commons to deliver his annual Budget statement, March 21, 2012.

Instead insomniacs are treated to the minutiae of Chinese domestic affairs courtesy of that country&apos;s CCTV News. President Bingu wa Mutharika sensed what direction the wind was blowing when, five years ago, he dumped Malawi&apos;s longtime partner Taiwan and adopted a &quot;one China&quot; policy, establishing diplomatic relations with Beijing. The rewards are writ large on the skyline of the capital, Lilongwe. A new parliament building went up in 10 months and the national conference centre in 12. Both came from Chinese contractors, although they are said to have created jobs for 500 and 900 Malawian workers respectively. China has also delivered the five-star Golden Peacock hotel (permanent jobs for 100 locals), presidential villas, school and university buildings, a 60-mile road and 600 boreholes for water. A national stadium and agricultural technology centre are among projects still to come. China also claims to have assisted farmers, dispatched 16 doctors with drugs and medical equipment and created training opportunities. A hundred Malawians have taken up scholarships to study in China. This is just one piece in a continental jigsaw. Three years ago China surpassed the United States as Africa&apos;s biggest trading partner. Bilateral trade grew from $10.6bn (\u00a36.67bn) in 2000 to $160bn in 2011, according to Chinese state media and Chinese investment totals $13bn. China says it has also provided tens of millions of dollars in food aid. The new $200m headquarters of the Africa Union in Addis Ababa was a gift from China as a &quot;symbol of deepening relations&quot;. What does the Asian giant want in return? Minerals, gas and oil, say critics, who warn of a morally blind &quot;resource colonialism&quot;. But in a rare interview, Pan Hejun, the Chinese ambassador to Malawi, painted a different picture, making no secret of his country&apos;s geopolitical ambitions. &quot;Our policy is to make friends with African countries to help with the natural development of both them and China,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;Some western media say China is in Africa only for minerals and oil. It&apos;s not true. We want to have broader co-operation in other fields like health and education. &quot;Malawi has no minerals and no oil, but it is one of the African countries we want to establish a relationship with. &quot;What do we get from Malawi? Diplomatic relations \u2013 Malawi sticks to a one-China policy \u2013 and respecting each other&apos;s sovereignty and national interests. We have Malawi&apos;s support on the international stage. We get friendship back from the Malawian people and that&apos;s what we want.&quot; Speaking recently on state TV, President Mutharika, aptly wearing a Chinese collar suit, boasted: &quot;The Chinese government has given us aid absolutely with no strings attached, just as one friend to another.&quot; Pan Hejun said: &quot;That is true, that is China&apos;s foreign policy. According to Chinese experience, the people of a country are clever enough to know their own needs. They can find their own path to development without input from outside. We are not here to impose our own ideas. We are here to offer our help. &quot;The people of Malawi have their traditions and culture and mindset. You cannot impose your own ideas on others. We think our policy is workable and sustainable.&quot; China has been criticised for propping up autocrats such as Sudan&apos;s Omar al-Bashir and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. A leaked US diplomatic cable described China in Africa as a &quot;pernicious economic competitor with no morals&quot;. But many African leaders praise Beijing for not preaching to them on human rights. Pan Hejun said: &quot;It&apos;s not China&apos;s policy to make regime change. Who is the king, who is the president should be the decision of the people of that country. You have no right to interfere with the internal affairs of a peaceful country and its set of laws. Only the people have the right to decide, not outsiders. To interfere in sovereignty is against international law. &quot;That is why China vetoed the resolution on Syria. We think the UN security council is not a place to do regime change or make a new king or president.&quot; Citing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, he said: &quot;We don&apos;t want to see these things repeated again. Our foreign policy is for peace, stability, development and co-operation. &quot;Politics and economics are not separate. When the economic links are closer, you will enhance relationships. China&apos;s influence in African countries is increasing.&quot; Last year, Britain&apos;s high commissioner was expelled after describing Mutharika as &quot;ever more autocratic and intolerant of criticism&quot;. It is not a fate likely to befall Pan Hejun. Less is more: that appears to be the Chinese strategy. &quot;I can tell you a secret,&quot; he said. &quot;It is not about influencing the internal policy decisions: let them decide by themselves. Some countries want to influence policy decisions but have failed. We do not interfere with internal affairs, so we get mutual respect. By not interfering, our influence increases.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2012/mar/23/london-book-fair-china-banned", "publicationDate": "2012-03-23T13:27:25Z", "tags": ["China", "Censorship", "Publishing", "London", "Business", "Books", "Chinese literature", "London book fair"], "sentences": ["Fortunately, these banned books (in simplified Chinese) need not be deserted as blacklisted writers enjoy the freedom of the press in Taiwan and Hong Kong, where books are published in traditional Chinese."], "title": "At the London Book Fair, China's money outweighs freedom | Bei Ling", "article": "Next month, a number of Chinese publishing houses will visit the annual London Book Fair, trying to drum up interest for their latest publications and most exciting writers. A number of books will never make it across to London, however. They include Soul Mountain and One Man&apos;s Bible by the 2000 Nobel literature prize winner Gao Xingjian, who now lives in Paris; Testimonials by exiled Liao Yiwu, a memoir charting his experience in jail after the 4 June 1989 Beijing massacre; Beijing Coma by Ma Jian, a long novel set against the backdrop of the 1989 massacre; M\u00e9moire interdite and Sh\u0101ji\u00e9 (Forbidden Memory: Tibet During the Cultural Revolution) by Tsering Woeser, a Beijing-based Tibetan, whose books provide unprecedented analysis of the Tibetan situation over the last 40 years; and Selected Poems by China&apos;s most acclaimed literary critic Liu Xiaobo and his wife Liu Xia. The 2010 Nobel winner has nine more years of prison to serve and his wife is under house arrest. None of these books will appear at the 2012 LBF. They are only a selection: over the last three decades, at least 100 books have been banned by the Chinese government. They are books that never see the light of day; books that alter lives of writers and publishing houses; books that were published and then retracted and destroyed. It all happens under the authority of the General Administration of Press and Publication (Gapp). In the last two decades, Gapp has established press and publication bureaux across all provinces and special administrative regions, compiling a blacklist of writers forbidden to publish. The number of names on the list, like the country&apos;s economic growth, increases every year. The criteria required to end up on the blacklist are: 1) whether the writer is a political dissident, openly criticising the Chinese government and political system; 2) whether the writer&apos;s work focuses on topics prohibited by the Communist party, such as the student movement of 1989 followed by the 4 June army crackdown and massacre, as well as the destruction of Tibetan monuments and eradication of Tibetan culture after the Dalai Lama&apos;s escape in 1959. The Communist party committee or party branch holds the decision-making power. They ensure that the text is free of &quot;political errors&quot; as well as profane content. If the book under review violates any of those criteria, it will not be granted publication. Books that have already been published are continuously subjected to examination by the publication bureau. This painstaking preview and review process views literature as an agent that disrupts the artificial utopia the government has tried to concoct at the expense of human freedoms and free will. The participants of the 2012 LBF will see this &quot;utopia&quot; but miss out on the relics of destroyed cultures and people. Because banned books cannot be published in China, they have gone unseen by millions of Chinese readers for almost 20 years. After another 20 years, the names of these authors as well as their books will be completely forgotten \u2013 if their existence was ever acknowledged at all. Fortunately, these banned books (in simplified Chinese) need not be deserted as blacklisted writers enjoy the freedom of the press in Taiwan and Hong Kong, where books are published in traditional Chinese. After I made a public complaint about the selection of writers at the festival, I received a response from the director of the LBF and the director of literature of the British Council. They informed me that the book fair&apos;s co-operation with China&apos;s Gapp will bring huge business opportunity for both countries. I understand the importance of money, but should there not be more to the world of books than business? This is British capitalism at its finest. When it comes to business, freedom of expression has to move aside. Set against the power of money, literature and freedom are nothing but ornaments. But writers are different. They each have a soul, rather than cash. They have to speak frankly. They cannot, and should not, trade what they have for any business opportunities. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/plastic-disclosure-project-waste-reduction", "publicationDate": "2012-03-23T17:19:00Z", "tags": ["Resource efficiency", "Waste and Recycling", "Guardian sustainable business", "Strategy"], "sentences": ["But he says one major cosmetics brand has completed the questionnaire, hospitals and sports clubs have asked about it, and investment funds in the UK, US, India, Taiwan, and Australia have agreed to be partners."], "title": "After carbon and water, the drive is on to reduce the world's plastic footprint", "article": "As you may have heard, we have a plastics problem. Millions of tonnes of the stuff goes into the sea every year, according to Plastic Oceans, a UK NGO. And, because plastic is made to be durable, that is where it stays. Plastic accounts for four-fifths of the accumulated garbage in the world&apos;s oceans, says the United Nations. And, perhaps most insidious of all, the debris is broken down by waves and sunlight into a sort of &quot;soup&quot; that fish and other wildlife mistake for food. This much is known. The question is, what can we do about it? Doug Woodring, a campaigner in Hong Kong, says one answer is to bring greater accountability to the use of plastics. He is asking companies, and other major plastic consumers, to disclose how much plastic they are using, in the hope that measuring is the first step to minimising, re-using, and finding alternatives. His Plastic Disclosure Project, launched last October, aims to emulate the success of the Carbon Disclosure Project, which now counts more than 3,000 organisations as members and is widely credited with driving carbon reductions at a company level. More broadly, he is trying to establish the concept of a &quot;plastics footprint&quot; alongside the carbon footprint, and more recently, the water footprint. &quot;The Plastic Disclosure Project is a great way to get companies and communities to value and look at plastic in a different way,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;re not saying &apos;Don&apos;t use it&apos;; we are saying, &apos;Let&apos;s close the loop&apos;.&quot; Woodring is trying to gain momentum for his campaign by sending out questionnaires, while encouraging investor groups, consultants, and other NGOs, to act as champions. So far, he has not announced any members. But he says one major cosmetics brand has completed the questionnaire, hospitals and sports clubs have asked about it, and investment funds in the UK, US, India, Taiwan, and Australia have agreed to be partners. Several consultants also want to be involved. &quot;We&apos;ve heard from a lot of consulting businesses who see the project as a way for them to go to their clients and say &apos;We&apos;ve done the carbon footprint, and your water footprint, now we can start with your plastic&apos;,&quot; he says. Anna Clark, president of EarthPeople, a US consultancy in Dallas working with the project, describes the scheme as &quot;very relatable&quot;. She thinks that because many people have heard of &quot;giant garbage patches&quot; in the oceans, they are primed to get involved. &quot;What&apos;s great is that it&apos;s a way for companies to reduce their impacts, while being part of something that&apos;s widely recognised by the public.&quot; Woodring says plastic should be an easier sell than carbon was \u2013 because of its &quot;higher consumer touch point&quot; and visibility. &quot;If your power plant tells you they have reduced their carbon footprint by 20%, you don&apos;t really know what that means. But if you say &apos;We&apos;ve changed our packaging and it&apos;s 50% lighter, it&apos;s a different shape, and now we can re-use it&apos;, that&apos;s something everyone can understand.&quot; Julie Frieder, a sustainability analyst at Calvert Investments, fund managers in Maryland, says it is too early to endorse plastics project, but that the disclosure model &quot;can definitely work in plastics&quot;. &quot;When companies have information, that can affect management behaviour, and it can affect investors in their ranking, scoring, and research,&quot; she says. &quot;It is also useful for NGOs to do their sorts of action, and governments can establish sound policy.&quot; To allay groans about &quot;questionnaire fatigue&quot;, Woodring is keeping the initial survey simple. It asks only what volume and weight of plastics groups are using, what recycling they have in place, and what plans they have to reduce plastics use, or switch to bio-plastics. Woodring has a long way to go before the plastics project approaches the relevance of its carbon counterpart, which since 2000 has got the backing of 655 investment groups, with $78 trillion under management, set up offices in three countries, and recruited partners in another 18. For the moment, Woodring says his staff is small and that he has limited funds to market the scheme. The position of the plastics industry probably does not help. When asked about disclosure project, Keith Christman, managing director of plastics markets for the American Chemistry Council, says he welcomes anything that helps cut waste. But, he says &quot;if it encourages people to switch to alternatives, it could have negative impacts&quot;, and &quot;major unintended consequences&quot;. The council argues that the lifecycle of plastic packaging is less carbon and energy-intensive than, say, paper. Instead of reducing plastic for its own sake, it calls for greater enforcement of litter laws, more recycling and energy-from-waste, and further research. Forty-seven plastics trade associations signed a &quot;global declaration&quot; last year, agreeing to such measures. Louis Lindenberg, global packaging director at Unilever, is also sceptical about the plastics project. &quot;I&apos;ve heard about it, but I&apos;ve wondered as to the value of it,&quot; he says. &quot;What is it going to deliver? Plastic is here, and it&apos;s going to stay, I&apos;ve no doubts about it.&quot; But, in a sense, Unilever proves the value of Woodring&apos;s approach. A couple of years ago, the company did a full lifecycle assessment of the packaging it was using, eventually commiting to a 50% waste reduction by 2020, under its 2010 Sustainable Living Plan. It is fair guess that if all companies took Unilever&apos;s approach, Doug Woodring, and his organisation, would not be too unhappy. For now, he is struggling to achieve a lot less.

His job is to keep the crowds attending the sprawling trade fair at bay. Behind him, a pavilion the size of a bus garage houses the latest technology produced by China&apos;s Huawei. Those without a meeting to attend are told they cannot enter, and cameras are banned inside. Huawei is China&apos;s biggest exporter, and its equipment helps run the BT broadband network, but the brand is unknown to most UK households. Regarded as a secretive organisation even within the people&apos;s republic, Huawei is headed by a former Red Army engineer, Ren Zhengfei. Unlike other Chinese IT firms, such as the PC maker Lenovo and telecoms group ZTE, Huawei is not listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. A private company owned entirely by its founders and employees, the names of its board members were only published for the first time last year. But it is also a flagbearer for China&apos;s &quot;going out&quot; policy of encouraging the first generation of corporations created by economic liberalisation in the 1980s to compete on the world stage. Entrepreneurial and unbureaucratic, it has prospered without having the state as a shareholder. It sells everything from mobile mast radios to software, data-centres and laptop dongles. Founded in 1987, Huawei only began exporting in earnest in 2000, but already over 65% of its revenues are from abroad. Last year, they totalled 185.2bn yuan (\u00a318.51bn), just half a billion pounds less than the world&apos;s largest telecoms equipment group, Ericsson. Now Huawei is preparing to step out of the shadows. While its governance remains veiled, the company is pushing its brand to the fore. It wants to place its products in the hands of millions of western consumers, and become the fourth largest manufacturer of smartphones by the end of this year. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last month, Huawei&apos;s devices chairman Richard Yu said that by the end of 2012 he hoped to have sold 60m smartphones, up from 17m last year. Hitting that target would vault the firm into the big league, behind Apple, Samsung and Nokia, and ahead of BlackBerry maker RIM and Taiwan&apos;s HTC. To succeed, it will have to redefine what &quot;Made in China&quot; stands for. While Huawei&apos;s hometown of Shenzhen is the electronics workshop of the world, churning out iPhones for Apple and PCs for Dell, its produce usually bears the stamp of a foreign company. Aside from PC maker Lenovo, it is hard to name a Chinese brand known to European and American shoppers. &quot;Consumer perception is that a Chinese product is cheap and looks cheap because the quality is no good,&quot; says Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst at research firm IDC. &quot;Huawei needs to change that perception.&quot; Jeronimo believes Huawei products have the quality to compete, but says it will need to raise its public profile. The charge will be led from the UK, where no expense has been spared in recruiting British executives and an advisory board to help find friends in high places. Former Sunday Telegraph editor Patience Wheatcroft is an adviser, as is Amazon&apos;s ex-UK boss Brian McBride, and Sir Andrew Cahn, once chief of staff for Neil Kinnock and recently chief executive of UK Trade &amp; Investment, the government trade promotion body. To promote the smartphones, Bartle Bogle Hegarty, ad agency to Google and BA, will create a global campaign from London. &quot;It&apos;s imperative we are seen as a global brand and not a Chinese brand,&quot; says Mark Mitchinson, a Samsung veteran running Huawei&apos;s UK devices arm. His newest stock are phones and tablet computers running Google&apos;s Android interface, which house computer chips that have four rather than the now usual two processors, allowing them to handle multiple instructions at the same time. They are fast, particularly when it comes to downloading video. While most phone makers prefer to leave chips to specialists like Intel, Huawei, whose name stands for &quot;China can&quot; and &quot;splendid act&quot;, designed its quad core processors in house and has become known in recent years for innovating. Some 62,000 of its 140,000 staff work in research and development, and there are 23 R&amp;D centres around the world. Without a recognised brand, Huawei&apos;s phones will sell on price. Its mission will be to mop up those mobile subscribers who don&apos;t yet own a smartphone, rather than trying to poach Apple&apos;s customers. With BlackBerry caught napping and now adjusting to a new chief executive, and Nokia yet to prove its adoption of Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone interface can turn business around, Huawei is seizing a window of its own. &quot;There are certain manufacturers that have dropped the ball over recent years and others can pick up that ball and run with it,&quot; says Mitchinson. Samsung has shown it can be done. The Korean company moved from fifth to second spot globally in smartphone sales last year, the only one in the top five to grow in the face of the unstoppable iPhone. There are those who wonder why Huawei is so keen to risk its hard-earned yuans by chasing capricious mobile phone customers. The answer is that this is a high-growth market. Even in an early adopter nation like the UK, only half of us have a smartphone. And the handset market has the attraction of being a less politically sensitive one than infrastructure. Huawei is already big in Europe, having last year won a breakthrough contract to overhaul the network of the UK&apos;s largest operator, Everything Everywhere. But an offer to donate \u00a350m of equipment to bring a mobile signal into the London Underground in time for the Olympics was never taken up. MP Patrick Mercer described the possibility of detonating bombs with phones on trains as &quot;the answer to terrorists&apos; prayers&quot;. A spokesman for Huawei says the deal fell apart not because of security fears, but because commercial agreement could not be reached between all the various players involved. The culture within Huawei is often described as militaristic. Information is shared on a need-to know basis, with one employee complaining anonymously on recruitment website Glassdoor: &quot;Don&apos;t expect to get the information or documentation to be able to carry out the job you are employed to do.&quot; Others who have worked there, like former UK mobile chief Jeremy Sheehan, says this comes from a desire to &quot;protect client confidentiality&quot;. Bengt Nordstr\u00f6m, a strategic adviser to European mobile networks, says Huawei has succeeded because of its ability to learn fast. While Chinese employees even in the UK still put their heads down on their desk for a nap after lunch, managers study for MBAs, and are offered crash courses in Western culture. &quot;Ten years ago they were really only selling on low prices,&quot; says Nordstr\u00f6m. &quot;It was hard to find people that could speak English well enough to conduct a business discussion. But for every quotation they produced, their quality increased. Customer relations is an area where Ericsson is stronger than any other vendor but Huawei have learnt that game.&quot; Backed by a $30bn credit line from the China Development Bank, the pattern of Huawei&apos;s international expansion has followed its philosophy, borrowed from Chairman Mao, of encircling the cities by winning the countryside. Beginning in Africa and Russia, it has moved successfully west. Only America has blocked its advance. Efforts to expand have been repeatedly neutralised by Washington. Offers to acquire Motorola&apos;s wireless division and a broadband software group were quashed after the sellers were informed that regulatory approval would not be forthcoming. A contract to modernise mobile operator Sprint Nextel&apos;s network was kyboshed, and the US commerce department last autumn barred Huawei from an emergency services contract. A British executive whose company buys from Huawei says US politicians are using espionage as a scare tactic to protect domestic businesses from foreign competitors. &quot;You&apos;ve got to remember the most protectionist country of the developed world is America. Rupert Murdoch had to become American to buy Fox. What the Americans are really trying to do is stop Huawei getting the business they know they could get if they opened up their equipment market to them.&quot; Huawei&apos;s stated ambition is to become as big as Cisco or IBM, with annual revenues of $100bn in 10 years. Nordstr\u00f6m says this is unlikely without conquering America: &quot;This is an industry where you need to be truly global to have a future.&quot; Observers say the most serious threat to Huawei&apos;s ambitions comes from within. As Ren approaches his 68th birthday in October, the company he founded is facing a succession crisis. In her letter published in last year&apos;s annual report, Huawei&apos;s charismatic chairwoman, Sun Yafang, thanked the staff for re-electing her, saying: &quot;I am sincerely grateful to our employees&apos; trust and confidence in me.&quot; It was a short statement that masked an internal power struggle. While Ren, who does not give interviews, has been criticised in the Chinese press for a lack of transparency, Sun is increasingly being seen as Huawei&apos;s public face, a networker who was among corporate China&apos;s most senior representatives at Davos this year. But in October 2010, a report in Meiri Jingi Xinwen (Daily Economic News) suggested Sun had been offered 1bn\u00a0yuan to leave Huawei so that Ren could prepare the ground for the appointment to the 13-member board of his son, Meng Ping, who is customer relationship management director and is said to have spent time in the US. The company denies this. Whatever the truth, Sun survived in a post she has held since 1999 and Meng did not join the board. But the Ren dynasty holds sway at Huawei; Ren&apos;s daughter Meng Wanzhou is chief financial officer. Meanwhile, Ren Shulu, the founder&apos;s younger brother, is a member of the five-strong supervisory board that oversees the directors. Both boards are elected every five years, by 51 staff representatives who are in turn elected by Huawei&apos;s 60,000 shareholding staff. Gary Liu, a professor at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, says Ren&apos;s determination to find a successor from within his family stems from 2000 when his then second-in-command, Li Yinan, left to start a rival company, Harbour. Ren fought and eventually bought Harbour, but the experience, says Liu, destroyed his trust in non-family members. Succession is not just an issue at Huawei. China&apos;s first generation of entrepreneurs at Lenovo and white goods maker Haier are also nearing retirement. &quot;These companies&apos; futures hinge on how effectively the incumbents manage leadership transitions. Indeed, the choices the founder CEOs make may well reshape their companies as well as the Chinese economy,&quot; says Liu. Ren has resisted a stock exchange listing, but ownership could help shed light on the business and build trust. Huawei may have to open its own doors before America decides to do the same."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/27/arab-spring-middle-east-executions", "publicationDate": "2012-03-26T23:06:00Z", "tags": ["Capital punishment", "Amnesty International", "Middle East and North Africa", "Iran", "China", "Asia Pacific", "US news", "Protest", "World news"], "sentences": ["&quot;We&apos;ve reached a tipping point globally where the vast majority of countries that are regarded as standard bearers of human rights have rejected the death penalty, and that makes it much harder for the US to explain why it is sticking to the practice.&quot; Methods of execution across the world included hanging, as in Iran; lethal injections, in China, Taiwan and the US; and beheading, in Saudi Arabia."], "title": "Arab spring leads to wave of Middle East state executions", "article": "Middle Eastern countries have stepped up their use of capital punishment, executing hundreds of people as rulers across the region seek to deter the wave of uprisings sweeping the Arab countries. Despite a significant reduction in the number of countries that used the death penalty worldwide last year, there was a sharp rise in executions in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Yemen, according to Amnesty International&apos;s annual capital punishment survey, released on Tuesday. China remained at the top of the list of the countries with the worst record of executions last year. Authorities in China maintained their policy of refusing to release precise figures on the death penalty in the country, which they consider a state secret. Amnesty said it had stopped publishing figures on China, available from public sources, because they were likely to &quot;grossly underestimate&quot; the true number, but reported that the country had executed thousands of people, more than the rest of the world put together. According to Amnesty, at least 676 judicial executions are known to have been carried out in 2011 globally, excluding China, up from 527 in 2010. More than half took place in Iran, which executed at least 360 people. But reports about the regime&apos;s campaign of secret and mass hangings of prisoners have made it impossible for Amnesty to publish the true figures there too. &quot;Amnesty has also received credible reports that a large number of unacknowledged executions took place in Iran, executions that would almost double the number of &apos;official&apos; ones there,&quot; it said. In December, Amnesty warned of a &quot;new wave of drug offence executions&quot; in Iran, which it described as a &quot;killing spree of staggering proportions&quot; in an effort to contain drug-related crimes. Saudi Arabia executed at least 82 people, which was 55 more than the minimum known figure for the previous year. Iraq, which had acknowledged only one execution in 2010, used the death penalty at least 68 times in 2011. Yemen executed at least 41, North Korea 30, Somalia 10, Sudan seven and Bangladesh five. Egypt and the United Arab Emirates are known to have executed at least one person, but exact numbers were unknown for Malaysia and especially for Syria, which has been rocked by violence in the past year. The escalating use of the death penalty in the Middle East is seen as a tactic by the authorities to spread fear among dissidents in order to prevent them from participating in pro-democracy movements. On a more positive note, fewer countries are resorting to the death penalty \u2013 20 in 2011, down from 31 a decade ago, Amnesty said. The United States has significantly reduced execution numbers, but still put 43 people to death last year. Amnesty&apos;s US director, Suzanne Nossel, said that significant progress has been made in the number of executions in America as well as the number of new death sentences handed out \u2013 78 in 2011 down from an average of 280 a year in the 1980s. The popularity of the death penalty in the US had also declined to record lows, she said. But Nossel said the company that the US was keeping \u2013 Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and a handful of other states practising executions \u2013 was increasingly glaring. &quot;We&apos;ve reached a tipping point globally where the vast majority of countries that are regarded as standard bearers of human rights have rejected the death penalty, and that makes it much harder for the US to explain why it is sticking to the practice.&quot; Methods of execution across the world included hanging, as in Iran; lethal injections, in China, Taiwan and the US; and beheading, in Saudi Arabia. Amnesty warned that Iran has used the death penalty at least three times on minors, in violation of international laws. Saudi Arabia is also believed to have carried out at least one juvenile execution. Those put to death globally were convicted of various charges ranging from murder to adultery and sodomy (in Iran), sorcery (in Saudi Arabia) and drug offences. Despite the executions, Amnesty said progress had been made even in countries that still carry out executions. In the US, Illinois became the 16th state to abolish the death penalty. In China, the authorities dropped the death sentence for 13 crimes, and in Iran the government made amendments to the country&apos;s penal code, although they did little to improve the situation there. In 2011, at least 1,923 people were given death sentences, taking the overall number of those on death row to 18,750. &quot;The vast majority of countries have moved away from using the death penalty,&quot; said Salil Shetty, Amnesty&apos;s secretary general. &quot;Our message to the leaders of the isolated minority of countries that continue to execute is clear: you are out of step with the rest of the world on this issue and it is time you took steps to end this most cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.&quot;He added: &quot;Even among the small group of countries that executed in 2011, we can see gradual progress. These are small steps but such incremental measures have been shown ultimately to lead to the end of the death penalty. It is not going to happen overnight but we are determined that we will see the day when the death penalty is consigned to history.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/27/scotch-whiskey-exports-soar", "publicationDate": "2012-03-27T14:44:32Z", "tags": ["International trade", "Economics", "Food & drink industry", "Business", "Scotland", "UK news", "Whisky", "Life and style"], "sentences": ["Brazil was the fastest growing market, recording an increase over 2010 of 48%, with Singapore and Taiwan close behind on 44% each."], "title": "Value of scotch whisky exports soar 23% topping \u00a34bn", "article": "The Scotch whisky industry boosted the value of its exports last year to a record \u00a34.2bn. Brazil was the fastest growing market, recording an increase over 2010 of 48%, with Singapore and Taiwan close behind on 44% each. The volume of exports was up by a healthy 19% showing strong worldwide demand and growth was not simply driven by producers raising prices. In 2010, volume was only marginally ahead at 2%. The Scotch Whisky Association said the value of exports was up 23%. The USA was the biggest importer, followed by France, although by volume France was ahead. Rising demand in emerging and more mature markets has resulted in export values increasing by an average of 10% a year over the last five years, said the Scotch Whisky Association. Exports contribute \u00a3134 per second to the UK balance of trade. The value of exports to the USA broke the \u00a3600m barrier for the first time in 2011 to reach \u00a3654.9m \u2013 up 31% on 2010. Exports to France increased 27% to \u00a3535.4m. Affluent young professionals in fast growing economies are increasingly developing a taste for Scotch, viewing the drink as &quot;a status symbol&quot; and &quot;trendy,&quot; said SWA&apos;s Rosemary Gallagher. To meet increased demand, distillers are investing record amounts in production capacity across Scotland. In the last four years the Scotch whisky industry has invested more than \u00a31bn in new facilities. The industry employs 10,300 people in Scotland and another 35,000 across the UK supply chain. Gavin Hewitt, chief executive of the SWA, said: &quot;Despite continuing economic uncertainty, Scotch continues to meet increasing demand from all corners of the globe. It continues to appeal to consumers in countries such as the USA and France and is being enjoyed by younger professionals in newer markets in Asia and Latin America.&quot; Exports have increased for seven consecutive years, contributing to delivering an export-led recovery, a focus for the UK and Scottish governments. But some markets saw a decline, including Spain and South Korea. Hewitt added that securing fair market access and reducing tariffs is now a priority for the whisky industry. A free trade agreement between the European Union and South Korea came into force in July. India is a priority for this year. Hewitt said: &quot;We are hopeful a free trade agreement can be signed which will lead to a reduction in the onerous 150% import tariff. The industry is investing in Scotland to ensure it can seize these overseas opportunities.&quot; The SWA figures derive from HM Revenue &amp; Customs data. They are based on individual company declarations of the export customs value and volume of shipments to each market (which may not be the final destination of the consignment). The figures do not reflect the mark-up charged by retailers. Scotland&apos;s Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead said: &quot;Scotland is rightly hailed as a land of food and drink, which is underpinned by the record exports achieved in both areas in 2011. &quot;This demonstrates that people around the world are appreciating the high quality and delicious products that Scotland&apos;s larder has to offer. &quot;With exports increasing by more than a fifth, the whisky industry has seen hugely impressive year-on-year growth, while Scotland&apos;s seafood remains at the heart of our food exports offering. It&apos;s also heartening to see a substantial 60% boost in fruit and vegetable exports.&quot; James Withers, chief executive of Scotland Food and Drink, said: &quot;Our food and drink industry is Scotland&apos;s biggest growth story right now. &quot;These new figures mean that the 10 year target industry set itself in 2007 - to grow our total exports by 38% - has been achieved six years early. &quot;Whisky has been a trailblazer across the globe. But our food sector is now following its lead, with exports up a staggering 62% in just four years, as our reputation as a land of food and drink grows day-by-day.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/mar/28/sustainable-local-development-alternative-microfinance", "publicationDate": "2012-03-28T06:00:00Z", "tags": ["Microfinance", "Global development", "World news"], "sentences": ["It was a set of carefully selected policies to support local private sector growth, starting with South Korea and Taiwan learning from Japan&apos;s support to SMEs."], "title": "Is sustainable local development a persuasive alternative to microfinance?", "article": "Milford Bateman is perhaps best known for his strident attacks on microfinance as an anti-poverty strategy, including his sometimes acrimonious debates with David Roodman, another microfinance analyst. Bateman claims that, by diverting resources away from more productive investments and indebting poor people with no significant return, the microfinance &quot;fad&quot; has been anti-developmental, benefiting lenders most. If, like me, you have been an instinctive believer in microfinance for the past few years, Bateman&apos;s critique is worrying. But even more worrying, perhaps, is the fact that Roodman, his apparent adversary on the subject, is also unconvinced. &quot;We do not have credible academic evidence that microcredit on average lifts people out of poverty,&quot; says Roodman. &quot;We [also] do not have evidence that microfinance is systematically making people worse off.&quot; Hardly reassuring. No one, it seems, is able to back up the microfinance industry&apos;s claims to be reducing poverty. In a systematic review of the evidence, Maren Duvendack, of the Overseas Development Institute, also gives what can only be described as a thumbs-down to the multi-billion dollar industry, concluding: &quot;[There is] no clear evidence that microfinance has any positive or negative impacts.&quot; But while much has been written on the rights and wrongs of microfinance, there has been less analysis of what might replace it and how funds could be better used to help poor communities move out of poverty. This is the question on which Bateman has developed a position that is compelling, well-evidenced and firmly part of the heterodox economic tradition populated by development economist Alice Amsden, who sadly died last week just as her ideas are regaining ground. Speaking at a conference on local development last week in Medellin, Bateman argued that where the local private sector (that is, small- and medium-sized enterprise) has developed successfully in the past, local governments have played a strong and decisive hand. This is in contrast to the neo-liberal insistence that the state should have little to do with local development. Europe&apos;s postwar recovery, according to Bateman, was managed under broadly Keynesian macro-principles and a tolerance for planning. From northern Italy to the Basque country, from west Germany to Scandinavia, local and regional governments were strongly interventionist in support of their small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and the upgrading of technological capacities was facilitated by access to affordable finance. The east Asian economic miracle was, of course, no miracle at all. It was a set of carefully selected policies to support local private sector growth, starting with South Korea and Taiwan learning from Japan&apos;s support to SMEs. China engaged in a range of local government interventions to support the private sector, long before foreign direct investment came into play. Vietnam is the latest country to build success on town and village administrative support for small-scale family farms and businesses; it now dominates several global sectors, and is the world&apos;s third-largest rice exporter (after the US and Thailand). In contrast, in Bangladesh, the home of microfinance, an NGO sector has been built up to the detriment of state capacity: as finance is circulated through the &quot;big four&quot; microfinance institutions (Grameen Bank, BRAC, ASA and Proshika) into informal microenterprises with no growth potential, the SME sector remains almost non-existent. The other example Bateman gives is Jeff Sachs&apos; infamous &quot;shock therapy&quot; experiment in 1980s Bolivia \u2013 again, savings and remittances circulated through for-profit microfinance institutions (such as BancoSol) and into &quot;postage stamp&quot; farms and informal microenterprises, leaving growth-oriented small enterprises with no support. Bateman is highly critical of the World Bank&apos;s Doing Business project, which he thinks is ideological and &quot;driven forward by business elites&quot;. Instead of addressing substantive and systematic issues at the local level that might require a collective response or co-ordinated state intervention \u2013 for instance demand constraints, affordable finance, lack of technical back-up, weak/non-existent agricultural extension services \u2013 it focuses on issues such as streamlined registration (the ease of registering a business), which is fairly irrelevant to business development. Bateman&apos;s alternative is based on an analysis of what has worked. There is now a need for community-based financial institutions that prioritise sustainable local development, such as credit unions, financial co-operatives, community and local state development banks, and social venture capitalist funds. In short, Bateman does for local development what economist Ha-Joon Chang has done for national development. He emphasises first how important it can be for local and national governments to get heavily involved in local development strategies, sets out examples of successful efforts of the past, and argues for an evolutionary approach whereby an appropriate mix of public and private is developed for each unique context. It is a convincing pitch, and one that should get extensive coverage."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/29/huawei-ban-cyber-cold-war", "publicationDate": "2012-03-29T16:12:22Z", "tags": ["Telecommunications industry", "Business", "Telecoms", "Technology", "China", "Australia news", "US news", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["While Ericsson sold its half-share in the loss-making Sony Ericsson mobile phone business in October 2011, Huawei has just ventured into the handheld business \u2013 and analysts already expect it to undercut rivals such as Taiwan&apos;s HTC."], "title": "Huawei contract ban stokes fear of cyber cold war", "article": "Being banned from supplying telecommunications products to one country may be bad luck. But the Chinese company Huawei \u2013 the world&apos;s second-biggest supplier of telecoms network equipment \u2013 this week found itself facing shutouts from both Australia and the US, fuelling concerns about a cyber cold war between east and west. The company announced this week it had been banned from tendering for contracts in Australia&apos;s A$38bn (\u00a324.7bn) National Broadband Network (NBN) because of cybersecurity concerns. Then it emerged that the reason why its joint venture with the US online security company Symantec (which had the 49% stake) was dissolved last November was that the US company feared losing out on information from the US government, according to the New York Times. For Huawei, it&apos;s part of a continuous uphill struggle. &quot;We were informed by the government that there is no role for Huawei in Australia&apos;s NBN,&quot; said Jeremy Mitchell, a Huawei spokesman in Australia. That will be a blow to the company, which aims to overtake Sweden&apos;s Ericsson to be the world&apos;s biggest supplier of telecoms infrastructure such as fibre-optic connections and routers. It is already heading that way: for 2011 its revenues were \u00a320.3bn, compared with Ericsson&apos;s 227bn kronor (\u00a321.5bn). But to take the top spot, it needs contracts in projects such as NBN, which was launched in 2009 and aims to connect 93% of Australian homes and workplaces to optical fibre by 2020, providing superfast broadband services in urban and regional areas. When Huawei sought a A$1bn supply contract for the NBN, the attorney general, Nicola Roxon, blocked the bid \u2013 on advice from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. &quot;This is consistent with the government&apos;s practice for ensuring the security and resilience of Australia&apos;s critical infrastructure more broadly,&quot; she said in a statement. Roxon was backed up by the prime minister, Julia Gillard: &quot;You would expect as a government that we make all of the prudent decisions to make sure that the infrastructure project does what we want it to do, and we&apos;ve taken one of those decisions,&quot; she said. Certainly, concerns about silent Chinese incursions into western businesses have never been higher. Besides hacker attacks on Google in 2010 \u2013 thought to be government-inspired \u2013 security companies and the Pentagon have uncovered evidence of infiltration into a number of important US companies, while some using suppliers in China have complained of more subtle theft of intellectual property. A Huawei source insists that &quot;we take cybersecurity very, very seriously&quot;. But what&apos;s wrong with Huawei, an employee-owned business set up in 1987 that has never been accused of such activities? First, its chief executive, Ren Zhengfei, was formerly a Chinese army officer, fuelling claims that Huawei has a cosy relationship with the Chinese government \u2013 something the company denies. Second, no Chinese company can do business without the approval of its government, and Huawei works in such sensitive areas \u2013 nothing is more essential to a modern country than its telecoms system \u2013 it faces extra hurdles that might not apply to western companies. The US has fuelled the concerns: in 2008 Congress blocked a planned purchase (along with Mitt Romney&apos;s Bain Capital Partners) of the networking company 3Com, and telecoms company TeaLeaf in 2011. Congress has also barred Huawei from selling kit to any US operator, after blocking a sale to Sprint Nextel in 2010. (The Huawei source says: &quot;There&apos;s a very concerted campaign around China. We are running into that.&quot; Such concerns also help US-based manufacturers, of course \u2013 which is where the votes are.) Against that background, the New York Times says Symantec had become concerned that, as the US government shifted an information-sharing program about cyber threats to the control of the department of homeland security, it would be frozen out. For a company reliant on corporate clients, that could be lethal. Symantec rebutted the claims on Tuesday, saying it had announced the sale of its 49% stake in November 2011,when its chief executive, Enrique Salem, said: &quot;Symantec achieved the objectives we set four years ago and exit the joint venture with a good return on our investment, increased penetration into China and a growing appliance business.&quot; In Australia, Mitchell said: &quot;While we&apos;re obviously disappointed by the decision, Huawei will continue to be open and transparent and work to find ways of providing assurance around the security of our technology.&quot; He also pointed out that &quot;Huawei is building NBN-style networks in the UK, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia and more&quot;. He could have included Qatar, where it&apos;s also helping. In fact, 45 of the world&apos;s top 50 telecoms operators are customers. Most of the missing five are in the US. &quot;We have never been told by the Chinese government to do a certain thing. If we would, that would be to our detriment and we would lose the market share that we have,&quot; Mitchell said. In the UK, BT reiterated its confidence in Huawei, and said that it was able to examine source code for products to check for &quot;back doors&quot; or eavesdropping functions. It said in a statement: &quot;BT&apos;s relationship with Huawei and other suppliers is managed strictly in accordance with UK laws and security best practice. BT&apos;s network is underpinned by robust security controls and built-in resilience. We continue to work closely with all our suppliers and the government, where appropriate, to ensure that the security of the network is not compromised.&quot; Australia&apos;s former foreign minister Alexander Downer, who is an independent director on the board of Huawei&apos;s Australian unit, rejected the government&apos;s security concerns. &quot;This sort of whole concept of Huawei being involved in cyberwarfare, presumably that would just be based on the fact that the company comes from China. This is just completely absurd,&quot; he told ABC Radio. But even if it is, there are those in the west who are reluctant to put aside their mistrust for now. But Huawei is likely to have the last laugh. While Ericsson sold its half-share in the loss-making Sony Ericsson mobile phone business in October 2011, Huawei has just ventured into the handheld business \u2013 and analysts already expect it to undercut rivals such as Taiwan&apos;s HTC. This week&apos;s setbacks for Huawei may not be its last, but the company is by no means finished with its ambition. Household names, just not in Britain Huawei Company from the Shenzhen special economic zone that is pushing to become the world&apos;s largest telecoms equipment manufacturer. Second only to Ericsson in size, it is branching into smartphones and has research centres around the world. Western concerns focus on its chief executive&apos;s former links with the Chinese army, the lack of clarity around its operations \u2013 and natural defensiveness about letting a company from a communist dictatorship run the most sensitive systems a modern country can have. ZTE  Formerly Zhongxing Telecommunication Equipment Corporation, ZTE also comes from Shenzhen and is growing rapidly in the telecoms sector, focusing increasingly on smartphones. Formed in 1985 by enterprises associated with China&apos;s ministry of aerospace, it has provided mobile networks for companies including Vodafone in the UK, Canada&apos;s Telus and France Telecom. It has been accused of helping Iran to get around US sanctions on the importation of systems from Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Oracle and Symantec. Lenovo When it bought IBM&apos;s PC business in 2005, many in the computing world were shocked \u2013 but it was just the beginning of the company&apos;s rise. While IBM got a 18.9% share (since reduced to below 5%), Lenovo was catapulted into the spotlight and is now one of the three largest PC vendors in the world. It has the advantage of being located in the heart of Asia, the largest market where PC sales are showing growth. (In the west they&apos;re shrinking.) It is also pushing into other products such as smart TV and, inevitably, smartphones, where it will be the first to use Intel chips."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/mar/30/mlb-2012-preview-american-league", "publicationDate": "2012-03-30T08:00:00Z", "tags": ["MLB", "US sports", "Sport", "New York Yankees", "Boston Red Sox", "Cleveland Indians", "Texas Rangers"], "sentences": ["The long story Hashtag: #bannedinkorea Prediction: The Orioles scouts will not get banned in Taiwan or Japan."], "title": "MLB 2012 preview: American League", "article": "Back in October the St. Louis Cardinals celebrated their wildly dramatic World Series victory over the Texas Rangers. Five months later, 30 Major League teams are back and ready for another ride on baseball&apos;s carousel. A lot went down in between: Cards manager Tony La Russa retired. A new collective bargaining agreement was signed, leading to a new playoff system and the Astros moving to the American League West for 2013. Mystery teams splashed out on blue chip free-agents Albert Pujols and Prince Fielder while Jose Reyes also left his ballclub for a team with a new name, new uniforms, a new stadium, a new manager and a lot of other new players. Ryan Braun overturned a positive drug test. The Dodgers were finally sold and the Mets continued to make headlines for the wrong reasons. In Boston, Terry Francona was fired, Bobby Valentine was hired and Theo Epstein left for Chicago to run the Cubs. Texas lost C.J. Wilson and replaced him with the Japanese pitcher named Yu Darvish, while the miserly Oakland Athletics made big trades of young pitchers before splashing out on Cuban slugger Yoenis Cespedes and brought Manny Ramirez back into the big league fold.  Now those A&apos;s are back from Japan after splitting two games against the Seattle Mariners, having kick started the regular season outside North America for the third time while the rest of the clubs hang out in Florida and Arizona for just a touch longer. On April 4, 2012 gets going in earnest when the Cardinals title defense begins with an opening night game vs. the newly christened Miami Marlins, which by the way, you can follow right here, live. Until then, here&apos;s part one of our two part MLB preview, beginning with a look at the American League. Part two - the National League - will be online on Monday. American League West Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 2011 Finish: 86-67 2nd place, 10 GB Main moves: Bringing in Albert Pujols and pitcher C.J. Wilson. Depth Chart Video: If all goes to plan, the Angels won&apos;t need this. The short story: Until last season, the Angels hadn&apos;t gone two consecutive years without making the playoffs since beating the San Francisco Giants in the 2002 World Series. This obviously upset their owner Arte Moreno, a very serious man, who put together some very serious plans to ensure such a streak would not continue. Owner and management flew under the radar and emerged as the mystery team, landing Albert Pujols for a salary significantly larger than my bar tab at the club. Just for a laugh, they also brought in C.J. Wilson to pitch. There are a handful of teams stacked with pitching riches and the Angels are one of them, so much so that Wilson finds himself as a number three behind Dan Haren and Jered Weaver in the rotation. Their bullpen was one of the best in baseball in 2011, and it&apos;s reasonable to expect more of the same this year. This team was already good, they just fell short with the bats last time out, and now they have the bat, plus DH Kendry Morales if he can stay healthy (so far so good this spring). Truth is, if the Angels hadn&apos;t dealt away Mike Napoli to Toronto last offseason, there&apos;s a very good chance that they would have had enough offense to beat out the Rangers in the AL West. Yes, they have a few holes, such as bottomless pit Vernon Wells, but hard to imagine them not topping Texas in &apos;12.The long story Hashtag: #themonkeyisbored Prediction: I&apos;ll leave this one to the cat. Apologies in advance. Oakland A&apos;s 2011 Finish: 74-88 3rd place, 22 GB Main moves: Dealing away the kids, closer Andrew Bailey, starters Trevor Cahill, Gio Gonzalez and Guillermo Moscoso, signing outfielders Yoenis Cespedes and Manny Ramirez.Depth Chart Nostalgic Video:            .The short story: If we know one thing about this A&apos;s team, it&apos;s that it&apos;s about tomorrow, not today. Oakland had excellent young pitching that performed well last season, but they dealt much of it away to stockpile even more young talent. To some this seemed somewhat surprising as the hurlers they dealt were under their control and affordable, even to the financially strapped franchise. However, when you consider that the A&apos;s are not about to compete in a division with the Angels and Rangers, it makes sense to make the most of what you have for the future. Their trade of Gio Gonzalez to the Nationals yielded four players that are considered top ten organizational prospects, and then they signed Cuban slugger Yoenis Cespedes to a four-year deal for $36 million. If he&apos;s good he&apos;s a more than an affordable big bat, or he&apos;s yet another chip for Billy Beane. Meanwhile the A&apos;s are trying to figure out their dire stadium situation, which if they have their way, will land the club in San Jose. It would be the franchise&apos;s third home since starting baseball life in Philadelphia. The long story Hashtag: #doyouknowthewaytosanjose? Prediction: A&apos;s finish last, Billy Beane quits after the season to run Liverpool, or not. Seattle Mariners 2011 Finish: 67-95 3rd place, 29 GB Main moves: Acquiring Jesus Montero from the Yankees for pitcher Michael Pineda, nevermind the minor league deals to Oliver Perez, Aaron Heilman and Kevin Millwood. Depth Chart Video: If this is 2011&apos;s most entertaining moment in Seattle... The short story: Seattle have lost a lot of ballgames over the past few seasons, and the good times of Ichiro&apos;s early days in the Queen City seem like a long long time ago. In 2001 the club set a record for regular season wins while the Japanese hit machine won the MVP and Rookie of the Year Award, but a decade later the coolest thing about the Mariners is the Ivar Dog on sale at Safeco Field. The good news is that ace pitcher Felix Hernandez says he loves Seattle and doesn&apos;t want to leave, going so far as to say he even enjoys the rain. Good thing, because it&apos;s going to pour around the Mariners again in 2012 with a uninspired roster of decent pitching and a lineup that with a few exceptions, couldn&apos;t hit water if it fell out of a boat. (rimshot). Selfishly speaking, as a big fan of the Ichiro show, I can only hope that his dismal 2011 season was an aberration and that he&apos;s got many more hits left in him. Meanwhile, it&apos;s been so dark in Seattle, they installed high powered grow lights just to get the grass ready for opening day, which may not be the best of signs. The long story Hashtag: #howaboutthosesounders Prediction: When the Astros join the AL West next season, third place won&apos;t seem so bad. Texas Rangers 2011 Finish: 96-66 AL West Champions, AL Champions Main moves: Replacing C.J. Wilson with Yu Darvish, who comes to Arlington via Japan and has Iranian heritage, which gets me excited. Signing closer Joe Nathan. Depth Chart Video: What do Yu think? (Yeah, I wrote that). The short story: Ask any Texas fan three years ago whether or not they would have signed up for back-to-back World Series defeats and they would have run to the contract. For a franchise that spent most of its history in the tank, this is a golden era, despite their complete collapse in Game Six of the World Series, and the departure of the good humored pitcher C.J. Wilson (he recently tweeted Mike Napoli&apos;s phone number to over 120,000 followers). Yes, there is still enough talent, not to mention laughs in the Rangers dugout for them to get back to the Fall Classic. Yu Darvish should easily replace Wilson in the rotation, while Neftali Feliz is finally making the conversion to starting pitcher--if successful, it will bolster a talented rotation. There is some concern that Joe Nathan may not be able to do the job as closer, so that&apos;s a question mark. Otherwise, we know they can score with names like Hamilton, Napoli, Beltre, Kinsler and Cruz in their lineup. That kind of offense should mean Nathan may not find himself in many tight spots. The long story Hashtag: #threesacharm Prediction: In the new wildcard playoff, two teams enter, one team leaves. American League Central Chicago White Sox 2011 Finish: 79-83 3rd place 16 GB Main moves: Manager Ozzie Guillen esta en Miami con lanzador Mark Buehrle. Carlos Quentin went west to San Diego. Former White Sox standout Robin Ventura is the new manager. Depth Chart Video: Robin Ventura is back in the AL, don&apos;t think Nolan Ryan hasn&apos;t noticed.             The short story: Last year the White Sox catch phrase was &quot;All In&quot;. A year later, it should be &quot;All Gone&quot;. Guillen and longtime ace pitcher Mark Buehrle ran out of town, as did Carlos Quentin. The team, saddled with busts like Alex Rios, Adam Dunn and a depleted Jake Peavy were lucky to finish just a few games below .500. The fallout set in before the season even ended when Guillen left his post before the last out of the year. It was a mess, one that will get cleaner with the arrival of Robin Ventura, a former White Sox player so well respected that even Guillen says nice things about him. Just because the dugout will be a more sane environment doesn&apos;t necessarily translate into more wins however. Can Adam Dunn hit again? Can Peavy ever be Peavy again? Can this Gordon Beckham pan out already? Can Alex Rios not be one of the least productive players in the game? Who will close? That&apos;s a lot of questions, too many for any rookie manager to answer me thinks. The long story Hashtag: #robinfightsbuttheteambites Prediction: It could get worse before it gets better, but the manager sets a positive tone and placates the rowdy Southsiders, for now. Cleveland Indians 2011 Finish: 80-82 2nd place 15 GBMain moves: Acquiring pitchers Derek Lowe. Signing Casey Kotchman, re-signing Grady Sizemore. Depth Chart Video: What do you mean too high? The short story: There&apos;s a core of baseball fans that like it when the Indians win, mostly because the film Major League is so near and dear to their hearts. When the Tribe do good, they&apos;re reminded of Jobu and Wild Thing and Willie Mays Hayes. So when Cleveland put together an extended run at the AL Central for a decent chunk of last season, there was a certain excitement among this group about what became known as the &quot;Indian Summer&quot;. Injuries, inexperience and a bizarre trade for an increasingly ineffective Ubaldo Jimenez, never mind the Detroit Tigers, put an end to the fun, but not before locals began to get excited about baseball in The Cleve. This year there is potential to be competitive again, even if it&apos;s unlikely that they can supplant the powerhouse Tigers. Yes, there are pitching question marks, but there&apos;s a substantial upside as well. If pitchers Derek Lowe and Jimenez can put their shaky 2011&apos;s behind them, their ace Justin Masterson means they&apos;ll have a deep rotation. Then there&apos;s the reliable Josh Tomlin, upstart Jeanmar Gomez who is fighting for a spot in the starting five, and of course, Roberto Hernandez, who you may know as Fausto Carmona. He may or may not be allowed to pitch in the Bigs again following the dropping of false identity charges in his native Dominican Republic, but it could help if he does. The bullpen is among the best in the AL while the bats are mostly young and potent. Asdrubal Cabrera, Carlos Santana and Shin Soo-Choo can hit, and Travis Hafner is patient, that is if he isn&apos;t hurt--Grady Sizemore already is. Whatever happens with the Tribe this season, they have one of the more compelling rosters in baseball. The long story Hashtag: #anygradyisgravy Prediction: The Tribe will be fun, but not this fun. Detroit Tigers 2011 Finish: 95-67 Central Division Champs Main moves: Tony La Russa consulting with Leyland in Spring Training. This Fielder guy from Milwaukee. Reliever Octavio Dotel, not re-signing Magglio Ordonez. Depth Chart Video: Tigers are playing with the (big) boys. The short story: Detroit gave Prince Fielder a $214m deal to help the Tigers take that extra step to a World Series having lost a thriller to the Texas Rangers in the ALCS. Their lineup is now stacked, considering that it also has Miguel Cabrera, who won the AL batting title in 2011, and survived a nasty hop resulting in a scary eye injury earlier this spring. Yes, their leadoff hitter Austin Jackson strikes out a ton, and they did lose Victor Martinez to a season ending injury this winter, but it won&apos;t matter, not with Son of Cecil in the fold. Then you have Justin Verlander as their ace, you may have heard by now that he&apos;s the reigning MVP and Cy Young award winner, not something that happens too often. They also have Doug Fister, who made all the difference after coming over from Seattle during last season. After him, the rotation is good but not great, and if there is a soft underbelly, it may be the back end of the starting five that features Max Scherzer and Rick Porcello--I wouldn&apos;t lose any sleep over them however. Can closer Jose Valverde be perfect, or even near perfect again? Unlikely, but any bullpen that contains an Al Alburquerque has my vote. Detroit is a sentimental choice for more reasons than their baseball team, they&apos;ll have a lot of neutral support in 2012.  The long story Hashtag: #winnow Prediction: Tigers are a coastal powerhouse marooned in the Midwest. Kansas City Royals 2011 Finish: 71-91 4th place 24 GB Main moves: Signing closer Jonathan Broxton, trading Melky Cabrera to San Francisco, getting Jonathan Sanchez in return along with a minor leaguer. Depth Chart Video: The George Brett Story. Enjoy.The short story: In 2003, Tony Pena&apos;s Royals started the season 17-7, spent 92 days in first place, and at one point, were 7.5 games up in the AL Central. It didn&apos;t pan out for overachieving KC, but it was a good show. In fact, it was the the only decent showing for the franchise in 17 seasons. In 2012, the bad news came early for Kansas City, with standout closer Joakim Soria out for the year after tearing his ulnar collateral ligament. At some point their luck has to change, especially when the farm system is being touted as among MLB&apos;s best. Eric Hosmer seems to be a bonafide hitting star and a reason to visit Kauffman Stadium. Mike Moustakas is also a serious prospect. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m alone in thinking it would be a lot of fun to watch the Royals become relevant again, but it probably won&apos;t happen in 2012. The long story Hashtag: #fountainsofyouth Prediction: Progress, but still waiting to breakthrough. Minnesota Twins 2011 Finish: 63-99 5th place 32 GB Main Moves: Signing Josh Willingham and Joel Zumaya, that is, until he tore his UCL. Lost pitcher Kevin Slowey, and outfielders Michael Cuddyer and Jason Kubel to free agency. Depth Chart Video: Ah, the Good Old Days The short story: Murray Chass, formerly of the New York Times and now independent writer, recently suggested to Twins GM Terry Ryan that he didn&apos;t get the press that A&apos;s frontman Billy Beane got because of the Moneyball factor. Ryan, understated, &quot;shrugged it off&quot;, saying that he gets &quot;enough publicity.&quot; Chass is right to bring it up because Ryan doesn&apos;t get the same sort of hype, never mind an Oscar nominated movie, despite their sharing a similar set of financial circumstances for years. Yes, the Twins have a new Stadium now, and thus, more dollars to throw around, but the Twins have done big things over the years with lesser resources. In 2011 however, it all fell apart as the team lost 99 games, mostly due to their big names, Joe Mauer and Justin Morneau missing a ton of games to injury, and a suspect pitching staff. They seem to be recovering, although we still don&apos;t know if Morneau can play first base regularly. They have Francisco Liriano, but depending on which way the wind blows he can be Steve Carlton or (insert name of any really bad lefty pitcher). The Twins will be better because they can&apos;t be worse, but again, with the Tigers around, and the Indians being more competitive, it will be tougher for the Twins to do their thing in 2012. The long story Hashtag: #nopitchsomehitnomatter Prediction: For now, these small-market miracles are on hiatus. They will battle Chicago for third place. American League East Baltimore Orioles 2011 Finish: 69-93 5th Place 28 GB Main Moves: None that will help, but they did land Endy Chavez who has a great smile. Depth Chart Video: These birds are looking good! The short story: The Orioles used to be a beautiful franchise. They won a lot of games, they won titles in the 1960&apos;s, 1970&apos;s and 1980&apos;s. In the 1990&apos;s they were competitive too. Even when they fell off the rails for a few seasons, they bounced back. Since losing to the Indians in the 1997 ALCS, they just bounce. The &quot;Oriole Way&quot; is now about losing, a lot. It&apos;s sad really. They have a great ballpark and a fanbase that really enjoyed rooting for their ballclub. Now the area&apos;s baseball tide is turning towards the Washington Nationals, whose core of young stars is pulling some of that support to D.C.. Why? It&apos;s hard to blame anyone but the owner. Since Peter Angelos bought the team, there&apos;s been a lot of bad news. Last year they won 69 games. The year before 66, the year before 64, and before that 69. Last year they could hit, but had the worst pitching in the league, last in ERA, homers allowed, hits allowed, runs allowed...you get the picture. The only fun they had all year was going 5-2 vs. Boston down the stretch, with Robert Andino putting the icing on the Sox collapse with his game winning single off Jonathan Papelbon on that famed September 28th. Will it be better this season? If they can pitch a little more, maybe. Don&apos;t hold your breath. The long story Hashtag: #bannedinkorea Prediction: The Orioles scouts will not get banned in Taiwan or Japan. Boston Red Sox 2011 Finish: 90-72 3rd Place 7 GB Main Moves: Chris Carpenter...no, not that Chris Carpenter, the one the Cubs traded to Boston for GM Theo Epstein, the one that&apos;s already hurt...thanks Theo. Closer Andrew Bailey and outfielder Ryan Sweeney from Oakland. Not resigning closer Jonathan Papelbon, Jason Varitek and Tim Wakefield retiring. Hiring Bobby Valentine as manager and promoting Ben Cherington to replace Epstein. Depth Chart Video: Encore presentation of Bobby V on inventing the sandwich wrap. The shorter story: It&apos;s not as fun to be a Red Sox fan today as it was, say, before August 31st, 2011. Since the September swoon began, one that resulted in one of the most spectacular late-season collapses in history, the Nation have not been happy, and to say there is a lot of discontent amongst their dedicated fan base is a gross understatement. The main targets are Sox ownership/management, who unceremoniously dumped their manager Terry Francona, who led them to 90 or more victories in six of his eight seasons as skipper, never mind two titles in four years after the club went 0 for the previous 86. Those same higher ups reportedly went out of their way to try and appease players annoyed with scheduling snafus by awarding them with gifts and parties on yachts, as certain members of the club were drinking beer and eating fried chicken in the clubhouse. Francona took the heat for his men, was dumped when the calendar flipped to October, and soon after that, the smearing began in the form of leaks about his personal life. Regardless of the source, it seemed that ownership were not grateful for the good times, a fact not lost on their fans. Less than two weeks later, GM Theo Epstein left to run the Cubs. Owner John W. Henry, President Larry Lucchino and new GM Ben Cherington hired Bobby Valentine to manage the team and change the baseball culture around Fenway. Meanwhile the front office got busy on a new enormous space inside the park called the Royal Rooters Club, for season ticket holders only, which seems to be further alienating the fan base. If that doesn&apos;t put a bee in their bonnet, then perhaps the over-the-top musical tribute to the 100 year old park, &quot;Fanfare For Fenway&quot;, created by Boston Pops conductor John Williams, will. Can the team move past all that&apos;s gone on since September? Well consider this, just this week pitcher John Lackey, who is actually out for the season, had this to say: &quot;Guys having a beer after their start has been going on for the last 100 years,&apos;&apos; Lackey said. &quot;This is retarded. It&apos;s not like we were sitting up there doing it every night. It&apos;s not even close to what people think.&apos;&apos; It&apos;s OK, he apologized. Meanwhile, Valentine was forced to deny a rift with Cherington over whether Jose Iglesias should be the shortstop and the best way to use Daniel Bard, in the pen or as a starter. There are more issues, the health of Carl Crawford and who should make up the back end of the rotation, but that seems more in line with any teams&apos; spring training decision making than all the other demons surrounding the ballclub. The team should be able to score as usual, but there are plenty of question marks pitching wise, never mind the general clubhouse chemistry. Valentine will do his best to put the spotlight on him and take the pressure off his players, and they&apos;ll need that. The longer story Hashtag: #ifeellikechickentonight Prediction: Valentine gets a lot out of the Sox, but is it enough?  New York Yankees 2011 Finish: 97-65 Eastern Division Champs Main Moves: Trading catcher Jesus Montero to Seattle for starting pitcher Michael Pineda, signing pitcher Hiroki Kuroda, DH Raul Ibanez, dealing A.J. Burnett, Jorge Posada&apos;s retirement. Depth Chart Video: Yankees Hospitality and, of course, Suzyn Waldman The short story: Zzzzzzz. The Yankees are boring. The Boss is gone and his once outspoken son Hank Steinbrenner, who once gave everybody a decent show, no longer says boo. All we have is Brian Cashman and his saucy personal life to bring a buzz to spring training these days, unless you count Andy Pettite&apos;s comeback as a juicy story. All quiet on the A-Rod front. Business as usual from Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera. A.J. Burnett, who could be counted on for some sort of controversy, is now in Pittsburgh, while the team he left behind is stacked with pitching. In fact, the Yankees could actually feature a seven man rotation and not miss a beat. I&apos;m not sure Raul Ibanez will light it up at DH, but then again, does it really matter. Runs will come in droves, the bullpen will be stingy again, and the Yankees will win a lot, as usual. Ho hum. Hashtag: #stillevil Prediction: Wake me up in October.  Tampa Bay Rays 2011 Finish: 91-71 2nd place 6 GB, Wild Card team Main Moves: Resigning first baseman Carlos Pena, signing DH Luke Scott, not resigning Johnny Damon. Depth Chart Video: Evan Longoria goes deep on a certain September night. The short story: How bad was the Red Sox collapse? Tampa lost four out of five games with ten games left in the season and still were able to take the wild card spot after winning their final five games, including the famed September 28th extra-inning encounter with the Yankees during which they came back from a 6-0 deficit. Dan Johnson&apos;s homer in their final at-bat tied it, Evan Longoria&apos;s line drive blast that just cleared the left field wall won it. Tampa were in the playoffs again, against tall odds, and doing so despite being unable to keep up with the Joneses of the AL East. The Rays players won without being supplied with private parties on yachts or special gifts, mostly because their pitchers put them in position to win daily, and that part of their game stands to improve in 2012. How does a 1-2 pitching punch of James Shields and David Price get better? When it becomes a 1-2-3 punch, which is what they&apos;ll have in their rotation now that the best prospect in baseball, lefty Matt Moore will have a slot. The rest of the rotation features the Rookie of the Year in Jeremy Hellickson, while Jeff Niemann beat out Wade Davis compete for the fifth starter&apos;s job. Tampa can catch the ball and hit a little, but not a lot. Johnny Damon (who is still looking for a job) and Casey Kotchman were replaced by fan favorite Carlos Pena and former Oriole Luke Scott, a pair that will whiff plenty, but should have more pop in their bat. I&apos;d be a touch concerned that Kyle Farnsworth will be unable to repeat his 2011 performance, but even if that happens, I&apos;m sure Joe Maddon&apos;s pitching rich team can come up with something. The long story: Hashtag: #wehavepitchingyeswedowehavepitchinghowboutyou? Prediction: Getting to the playoffs will be less dramatic in 2012. Toronto Blue Jays 2011 Finish: 81-81 4th place 16 GB Main Moves: Trading for closer Sergio Santos, but not a tremendous amount of action. Depth Chart Video: Here&apos;s the best move the Jays have made in years. The short story:The Jays are never really bad, and never really good, which has been their theme for some time. They were always tough to watch however, because their uniforms were butt ugly. Bad logos and gaudy fonts made the team seem worse than they actually were, but that should change now that they&apos;ve gone back to their baseball roots, donning a more traditional look that couldn&apos;t have come sooner. GM Alex Anthopoulos has some decent players to wear those refreshed retro uniforms, specifically slugger Jose Bautista, who is the headliner north of the border. Young Canadian third baseman Brett Lawrie has been getting a lot of attention because of his bat, and also because George Brett&apos;s old roommate says he reminds him of George Brett. Ricky Romero is a solid pitcher coming off his best season, but the rest of the rotation is kind of in show-me mode. So is Colby Rasmus who many thought was stolen from St. Louis after the deal was made, until he hit .173 in Toronto. The Jays aren&apos;t going to finish first, or second, or third or fifth. That leaves them right back in their familiar fourth spot, where they&apos;ve been for, you guessed it, four years.

With per capita income of around $20,000 (on a par with Portugal), it is not one of the richest countries, but we are talking about a country whose income was less than half that of Ghana&apos;s until the early 1960s. With an annual per capita income growth rate of just under 4%, it is one of the fastest-growing OECD economies. Once a byword for hyper-exploited sweatshop labour, churning out cheap transistor radios and trainers, the country now possesses the only thing that stands between iPhone and world domination (the Samsung Galaxy). It is also a world leader in industries such as shipbuilding, steel and automobiles. The country is, per capita, the third most innovative in the world, after Japan and Taiwan, when measured by the number of patents granted by the US patent office. It has one of the world&apos;s highest university enrolment ratios, and schoolchildren who rank in the top five in virtually all standardised international tests. So, when things seem to be going so swimmingly, why are Koreans clamouring for big changes in the run-up to the general election next week? Because they are desperately unhappy. According to a recent World Values Survey, Koreans are the second unhappiest people (after Hungary) among the citizens of the 32 OECD countries studied. Worse, its children are the unhappiest in the rich world, according to a survey of 23 OECD countries done by Yonsei University in Seoul. In 2009 the country topped the international league table for suicides, with 28.4 suicides per 100,000 people. Japan was a distant second with 19.7. But Koreans never used to be this unhappy. Until 1995 its suicide rate was, at about 10 per 100,000 people, just below the OECD average. Since then it has almost tripled. The answer to the Korean puzzle can be found in the consequences of the economic reform implemented after the country&apos;s 1997 financial crisis. In the UK-US mould, the stock market was fully opened to foreign investors, putting the larger, listed companies under pressure from international shareholders, making them increase short-term profits by minimising investments. The ability of smaller, unlisted companies to invest was severely curtailed by a dramatic reduction in credit availability. Deregulation allowed banks to rush into more lucrative consumer loan markets, reducing the share of loans to business. The resulting dramatic fall in investments has led to a substantial fall in economic growth from 6%-7% (in per capita terms) per year to under 4%. With lower growth, few well-paid jobs are created. When combined with the relaxation of labour laws after 1997, this has given employers a decisive upper hand over their workers. Many employees were sacked and re-hired as &quot;agency&quot; workers, doing the same jobs at lower wages. The proportion of the workforce without a permanent contract rose from an already high 50% to 60%, the highest in the OECD. Not that having a permanent contract gives you much protection these days. Most of the companies that used to (informally) provide &quot;lifetime employment&quot; for their core workers have ended the practice, with older staff put under pressure to make way for younger, cheaper workers. And all of this is being played out in the absence of a decent welfare state \u2013 the country has the second smallest in the OECD, after Mexico (measured by welfare spending as a share of GDP). Given this, people live in constant fear of unemployment, forced retirement, and major illnesses, which expose them to a life of penury. This &quot;fear factor&quot; also partly explains the country&apos;s excessive educational zeal. Pupils study hard, thinking that better educational qualification may give them a layer of protection in an unforgiving labour market. But since everyone is studying hard, they have to run faster to stay in the same place. The result is the combination of long study hours (double that of Finnish children, who do equally well in international tests), and enormous mental stress. Moreover, increased job insecurity has driven the best Korean students into &quot;secure&quot; professions, like medicine and law, leaving science and engineering deprived of top talents. If this trend continues, the country&apos;s ability to innovate will be damaged. The sad tale of my country should serve as a salutary warning to Britain and other European countries that are embarking on major cuts to welfare. They believe that such cuts will reduce budget deficits and make their economies more productive by making people compete more vigorously. However, the Korean story shows that insecurity actually makes people less, not more, productive, and also desperately unhappy. Surely, that is not what they want. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/02/asia-manufacturing-suffers-europe-recession", "publicationDate": "2012-04-02T17:32:44Z", "tags": ["Global economy", "Asia Pacific", "Manufacturing data", "Economics", "Business", "World news", "China", "South Korea", "Taiwan", "India"], "sentences": ["China, South Korea and Taiwan on Monday reported modest increases in sales and orders in March as businesses switched from selling to Europe in favour of exports to the growing US economy.", "In Taiwan, the PMI figures marked the second straight month of improving business conditions and the pace of expansion was the fastest since April 2011."], "title": "Asian manufacturing recovery held back by Europe", "article": "Europe&apos;s slide back into recession has been blamed for a sluggish return to growth across the manufacturing sectors of Asia&apos;s largest economies.

Only India bucked the trend in the region after months of high inflation and uncertainty over the outcome of regional elections undermined manufacturers&apos; confidence and hit sales. Delhi, at the centre of Asia&apos;s third-largest economy, suffered a third straight month of slower growth in its purchasing managers&apos; index (PMI), dragged down by a decline in orders. Indian businesses were also hesitant after the costs of raw materials showed no signs of falling. While the index remained above 50, it slipped to 54.7 in March from 56.6 in February. Any figure above 50 indicates expansion. China&apos;s manufacturers have also suffered the after-effects of rising inflation. Government attempts to cool the economy following a prolonged housing boom have included tighter credit controls, which have helped to avoid a hard landing. But the controls brought an end to the stimulus that kept the economy growing at a fast pace in 2010 and 2011. China&apos;s economy now appears to be headed for its weakest quarter since early 2009. Beijing&apos;s official PMI hit an 11-month high with a stronger than expected 53.1 for March. But a separate, private survey by HSBC, which focuses more on smaller factories than the large state-owned enterprises captured in the official data, paints a gloomier picture. The index stayed below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, coming in at 48.3. &quot;The upside surprise in China&apos;s manufacturing PMI is welcome, and should help quell excessive fears of a &apos;hard landing&apos; in China,&quot; said Vishnu Varathan, an economist with Mizuho in Singapore. &quot;But equally, we should not be lulled into thinking that China has turned a corner either. Global conditions continue to be highly uncertain notwithstanding the stabilisation in Europe and &apos;green shoots&apos; in the US.&quot; Qinwei Wang, China economist at analysts Capital Economics in London, said the official PMI might be too optimistic. &quot;The much better performance in the index probably reflects its seasonal strength around this time of the year rather than a significant improvement in conditions for the sector,&quot; he said. &quot;Indeed, the official PMI has never declined in March and the average increase in that month has been 3.2 points since it was first released in 2005 (excluding the latest data).

In lots of ways, we began before that, but without the name. In the last century there was very little international dance touring in the UK, excepting Dance Umbrella. I suggested to Sadler&apos;s Wells that when they brought these shows to London, we should tour them around so we approached the Arts Council and suggested Nederlands Dans Theater. The first tour we did was in 1997 as Sadler&apos;s Wells Presents. We then went back to ACE saying we had small but enthusiastic audiences but to develop it, could we bring back the same company to work on establishing audiences for them? And we got funding for three years. What was your dance background? Ballet, then contemporary. I was originally secretary to Beryl Gray at London Festival Ballet. We did a lot of international touring, taking Rudolf Nureyev all round Europe in the 1970s and when Dame Beryl left, Harold King of London City Ballet asked if I was interested in joining him. With London Festival Ballet, we took 100 people on the road \u2013 the thought of working with a smaller company and developing it from scratch was very appealing. When I started with London City Ballet it was 22 dancers but we grew it into 36 with an orchestra. The Princess of Wales became our patron and that was wonderfully helpful. I toured the company abroad and when I left them in 1993, I decided to go freelance, organising tours for Rambert and Matthew Bourne&apos;s Adventures in Motion Pictures, right up to his all-male Swan Lake. Beyond that, I concentrated on contemporary. I&apos;d done my Swan Lakes by then! Dance Consortium has 19 member venues \u2013 how did so many come on board? There were lots of theatres that had been newly refurbished or built at the time such as the Lowry in Manchester and the Wales Millennium Centre. The wonderful Stephen Barry contacted large scale theatres in 2000 and asked: &quot;Are any of you interested in forming a group to tour international contemporary dance in the UK? Come to a meeting in Milton Keynes.&quot; That was when it was born. There was no one to organise tours so we applied to ACE to cover freelance administration costs and I took on a coordinating role. The first tour we did was in 2003 \u2013 we&apos;re now on our 28th. We used to take all the theatres to see performances in Holland. We&apos;d discuss the repertoire and programme and really get them understanding contemporary dance; it was new territory for most of the theatre managers. We were teaching them as we went along, but the venues really enjoyed it. By the time the company came to the UK, they were cheering for them as if it was their own football team. It was a team effort and a learning process \u2013 one we&apos;ve been on ever since. How do you pick which companies come? We&apos;ve always been careful to present the accessible side of contemporary dance. These are large theatres with big audiences and there aren&apos;t many companies that could fill them. We&apos;re not talking musicals or a national dance company \u2013 it&apos;s not a sure fire hit as far as tickets go. But between us all, we are very aware what works. We&apos;ve also established a policy of bringing companies back such as American Dance Theatre or Deborah Colker from Brazil. That way we establish relationships between them and our audiences. Do audience demographics vary up and down the country? Hugely \u2013 even two shows in one place can get a totally different reaction depending on the crowd. We do a lot of research and we&apos;ve created teams within the venues so that after each tour we do a post-mortem marketing meeting to review all the box office figures we&apos;ve got access to and ask: &quot;What sort of audience are you attracting?&quot; with a view to where we&apos;re going in the future. The ticket sales are circulated round to every member of the consortium so all the marketing people can see them, and that works on the promotion front as well. Do the London runs attract more press attention? That&apos;s probably the case as far as English dance critics are concerned. They are not easily drawn out of London. Fortunately in this country I don&apos;t think the dance critics influence an audience too much. Sometimes if you get a bad review, people will come just to see whether they agree with the critics \u2013 it&apos;s not like New York theatre where critics can close a show. How often does the consortium meet? The group&apos;s been together for a long time and we really encourage them to get to know the other members. The theatre&apos;s marketing managers, education departments and technical directors get together each year and they say the most useful thing about those days is meeting other people with the same problems. The majority of theatres wouldn&apos;t tell another theatre if they were doing well or badly so the fact that we circulate ticket sales each week is a big deal. And if one venue is doing better business with the same company, we share why we think it&apos;s working. Have you had to adapt to the tougher financial climate? What we&apos;re not doing is bringing in the very expensive companies. With international tours, you&apos;re covering the flights and per diems and the hotel rooms so we made a positive decision to cut out the large companies and tour the smaller ones. Also, we don&apos;t have a paid office and work hard to put as much of our Arts Council funding into the actual tours themselves. What is the biggest challenge of working with international companies? Understanding what everyone is saying \u2013 they sometimes struggle with our regional accents. Also, these are technical productions; companies are going to be nervous about facilities so we have a production manager who sees the whole technical side through and organises any equipment we need to hire in, such as lights. A company from Taiwan even needed an area to pray backstage. I have a very important link with my travel agent who liaises with me over the accommodation and travel \u2013 you want to know the coach is going to be there when you need it to be, and where you stay is your home on tour, so it&apos;s important we find somewhere as nice as possible. We know the venues inside out now and the towns too. And the biggest joy of the job? When I sit and purr quietly in the stalls as another performance gets a standing ovation. First and foremost, I&apos;m a dance fan so seeing audiences rise to their feet never gets old. Officially, I&apos;m both coordinator and tour manager and that combination is terribly important; you can organise things sitting in London but you don&apos;t get the details right unless you&apos;re there in the theatre. Will we see more consortia in the future? It&apos;s happening already. There were several theatre consortia when we formed \u2013 we went to see them for advice \u2013 and we&apos;re only going to see more. Our co-chair recently formed the Music and Lyrics consortium. This whole networked way of working is the way ahead.

In a brief statement, Accell, the biggest bike firm in Europe but relatively little-known in the UK, said it had begun discussions &quot;which, if successfully concluded, could lead to the acquisition of Raleigh&quot;. Raleigh confirmed the talks but had nothing to add. At is peak Raleigh, named after the Nottingham street where founder Frank Bowden bought a small bike shop in 1887, made 1m bikes a year and employed so many staff that the company had its own ballroom and bowling green. While it continued huge production levels into the 1970s and 80s with famous bikes like the Chopper, Grifter and Burner, poor management and inefficiency brought losses and Raleigh was bought in 1987 by a former sportswear executive, Alan Finden-Crofts, backed with US money. Tough times continued, and after the parent company went bankrupt in 2001 Finden-Crofts led a management buyout. The company he now hopes to sell employs fewer than 200 staff in the UK and stopped manufacturing frames or bike components in 1999, four years later outsourcing even the assembly of the bikes to companies overseas, principally in Asia. The loss of another British manufacturing icon to overseas buyers is thus largely symbolic. The UK remains something of a cycling backwater, despite an upsurge in bike use in recent years. Figures suggest that fewer than 2% of non-walking journeys in the UK are made by cycle, as against more than a third of those in the Netherlands. Accell, which had a 2011 turnover of \u00a3525m last year, sells the bulk of its bikes in the Netherlands and Germany under brands including Batavus, Koga, Hercules and Lapierre. News of the likely sale comes as little surprise, said Carlton Reid, who runs the BikeBiz cycle industry website. Finden-Crofts, 70, and his fellow owners had been &quot;openly and not so openly touting Raleigh for some years&quot;. Reid added: &quot;They&apos;ve got it back on their feet and it&apos;s a reasonably good time in the bike industry.&quot; The modern cycle industry is very different from the era when steel frames were hand-welded in Raleigh&apos;s workshops before being fitted with components developed and made within the same company, like the famous Sturmey Archer gears, a company absorbed by Raleigh in 1902 and later sold off. While a few smaller companies still make their own bikes, such as the folding machines produced by west London&apos;s Brompton, the great majority of frames are manufactured by contractors in places such as Taiwan and Malaysia and equipped with Identikit parts from one of a handful of giant firms such as Japan&apos;s Shimano. The main role for companies like Raleigh is design, marketing and adding a brand. The Nottingham company has improved its performance in recent years, thanks in part to some highly-praised top-end bikes, joined in 2010 by a resurrected Team Raleigh squad of riders. &quot;There was definitely time when you would have thought, &apos;Who on earth would mourn Raleigh? There&apos;s a multiplicity of brands all doing it better than they are&apos;. But things have picked up in the last few years,&quot; said Reid. &quot;That said, Raleigh are never going to be the 60%-70% market domination like it used to be, ever. Those days are well gone.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/05/tiger-head-snake-tails-jonathan-fenby-review", "publicationDate": "2012-04-05T08:00:03Z", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Liu Xiaobo", "World news", "China"], "sentences": ["He takes time out to glance at Hong Kong and Taiwan, both of which present intriguing Chinese alternatives to the mainland political paradigm."], "title": "Tiger Head, Snake Tails: China Today, How It Got There and Where it Is Heading by Jonathan Fenby - review", "article": "China, Jonathan Fenby argues in his new book, &quot;does everything on a scale that breeds shock and awe&quot;. It has the largest monetary reserves in the world, at more than $3.2 trillion; it consumes more than a third of the world&apos;s supplies of key metals and half the world&apos;s cement. Every two and a half minutes, Greenpeace estimates, it produces enough toxic ash to fill one Olympic-size swimming pool. It is a nation of violent contrasts: it may have as many as 600 dollar billionaires, as well as 300 million people without access to clean drinking water. Despite the government&apos;s fixation on national unity (its &quot;tiger head&quot;), Fenby asserts, it is a mass of snake&apos;s tails. &quot;There is not one China but a hundred, a thousand or a million.&quot; The extremes that characterise China mean that it is a remarkably hard country to make sense of. The place is so large and diverse that you can dig up reasonable bodies of evidence to back up wildly diverging hypotheses about its future. In 2010, Robert Fogel, a Nobel prize-winning economist, predicted in Foreign Policy magazine that China would end America&apos;s global dominance in 2040. By this point, he proclaimed, &quot;China will account for 40% of the world&apos;s GDP, dwarfing the US (14%) as the world&apos;s largest economy&quot;. His article was paired with one by Minxin Pei, a professional China-watcher who presented a more sober perspective. Pei argued that an ageing population, environmental degradation, inequality and corruption, and an opaque business culture threaten to bring the country low long before it comes anywhere near ruling the world. Everyone agrees that China has grown extraordinarily, and relatively easily, over the past three decades. Consensus on what will come next is practically non-existent: perhaps the same rate of growth; or perhaps a massive demographic slowdown, an over-inflated economy, environmental meltdown and the strains of one-party rule will bring the whole edifice down. As a handbook on the confusing state of contemporary China \u2013 covering the economic, political, social and historical essentials of the story \u2013 Tiger Head, Snake Tails succeeds admirably. Fenby moves between the expansion of transport and infrastructure that has unified the country logistically as never before, the cities that are spearheading the country&apos;s economic miracle, the poor working conditions and growing militancy of its labourers, its diverse mass of enormous factories and cottage industries, the push and pull between the centre and the provinces, between Han Chinese, and Tibetans and Muslims. He takes time out to glance at Hong Kong and Taiwan, both of which present intriguing Chinese alternatives to the mainland political paradigm. One of the big questions hanging over China&apos;s future concerns the stability of its political system. Until now, analysts have observed, the government has struck a successful tacit bargain with its people: tolerate our authoritarian rule and we&apos;ll make you rich. Despite a phenomenal expansion of economic opportunity, political freedoms lag far behind. The Communist party is unflagging in its efforts to maintain its monopoly on power: &quot;dissidence&quot;, Fenby writes, &quot;is equivalent to treason.&quot; Liu Xiaobo, winner of the 2011 Nobel Peace prize, languishes in jail after petitioning the government for democratic reform. Human rights lawyers are tortured and crippled. A television talent show, Supergirl, that required viewers to vote for their favourite contestant, was cancelled, at least partly because of fears that audiences would become hooked on the idea of popular choice. And yet beneath this rigid power structure, a barely controlled chaos often prevails. Corruption is rife, and chancers taking advantage of market reforms have generated scandal upon scandal: food safety, thefts of the national heritage, horrifying rail and road accidents. One of Fenby&apos;s most gripping chapters is on the &quot;trust deficit&quot; that clogs so much of life in China. In 2008, the country was rocked by revelations that one of its biggest baby-milk companies had been adulterating its formula with ground melamine (essentially, powdered worktop). Doctors are routinely bribed by patients anxious for preferential treatment; medicines are often counterfeit. The architects of a pyramid scheme made billions of yuan persuading gullible customers to buy &quot;medicinal ants&quot; that needed feeding with egg yolk and cake every three days. Political corruption is endemic. A couple of years ago, a six-year-old girl \u2013 when asked by a television interviewer what she wanted to be when she grew up \u2013 answered: &quot;a corrupt official&quot;. One wealthy smuggler flourished for almost two decades by handing out ten million yuan a month in bribes to his high-level connections. As a result, China seethes with injustices and public discontent. There is a risk that a book summarising such a monumental story might get bogged down in dry, statistical detail. Fenby avoids this through lively, first-person reportage and vivid vignettes. Throughout the book, he takes a serious-minded delight at the country&apos;s absurdities and grotesqueries: the local government that required female civil servants to have &quot;symmetrical breasts&quot;; the railway minister with 18 mistresses; the Daoist priest who won a wealthy following by sitting underwater for two hours without breathing (&quot;it later transpired that he was encased in a glass box with a supply of oxygen&quot;). No single book could ever describe the full complexity of contemporary China, and Fenby has made tough but judicious decisions about what to leave out. Perhaps the most regrettable omission, though, is the neglect of Chinese culture. Although the pace of life in China can often seem too frenetic to permit anyone to settle down long enough to write, film or paint anything, its flourishing literary, cinema and art scenes offer fragmentary but intensely individual insights into this confounding country \u2013 a welcome counterbalance to the big headline stories about industry, GDP, diplomacy and political succession. But as a one-stop guide to political and economic realities in China today, Tiger Head, Snake Tails is fast-moving, informed and illuminating. \u2022 Julia Lovell&apos;s The Opium War: Drugs, Dreams and the Making of China is published by Picador."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/05/raleigh-sale-not-end-of-road", "publicationDate": "2012-04-05T10:51:59Z", "tags": ["Cycling", "Business"], "sentences": ["I met with Finden-Crofts and his wife Carol at the Taiwan Cycle Show in March (Raleigh long ago outsourced its manufacturing to Asia and beyond) and asked whether a rumoured sale would see yet another flop, and a third rescue by Finden-Crofts."], "title": "A Raleigh sale won't be the end of the road for this historic British brand | Carlton Reid", "article": "Raleigh&apos;s probable acquisition by Accell of the Netherlands, announced earlier this week, is not a distress sale. There are many times in its 125-year history when the company has been a basket-case but, right now, the historic English brand is profitable, benefiting from increased consumer demand for bicycles and 10 years of mostly sound management. The managing director is a former accountant and survived his &quot;Ratner moment&quot; of likening bike shops to Steptoe and Sons and calling Halfords, his main customer, &quot;a bunch of vipers&quot;. Accell is a dominant player in the bicycle business on mainland Europe, where sales of high-margin electric bikes are booming. The Dutch company has little sales penetration in the UK and a portfolio of globally unknown brands. Owning Raleigh would change that. Selling to Accell will be good for Raleigh, too. Or, at least, good for the majority shareholders, including Alan Finden-Crofts, a former CEO of Dunlop Slazenger who rescued Raleigh in 1987 when it was a loss-making part of a British manufacturing group. He was cruelly nicknamed Alan Fingers-Crossed by shopfloor workers in the 1990s. They wept when Raleigh sold gears maker Sturmey Archer for 30 quid to parties of dubious appropriateness. It wasn&apos;t Finden-Croft&apos;s fault that Sturmey Archer \u2013 and the valuable land where its factory once stood \u2013 were sold without proper due diligence. That was the work of the American chief executive of Raleigh&apos;s then parent company, Derby Cycle Corporation. During his brief and disastrous tenure, Gary Matthews spent millions of dollars on consultants and a flash corporate office in Connecticut. Derby collapsed under unsustainable debts in 2001. Finden-Crofts led a management buyout, and rescued the Raleigh brand for a second time. I met with Finden-Crofts and his wife Carol at the Taiwan Cycle Show in March (Raleigh long ago outsourced its manufacturing to Asia and beyond) and asked whether a rumoured sale would see yet another flop, and a third rescue by Finden-Crofts. Carol put the brakes on that idea, insisting &quot;not again!&quot; Finden-Crofts smiled, but the sparkle in his eye dulled ever so slightly. When pushed on who he&apos;d be selling to, he waved his arms around as if any of the surrounding companies would be possible suitors. In reality, there were few options open to him. Trek, the dominant bicycle supplier in America, took a look at the books but it sniffs around all of its competitors. Dutch car importer Pon was a potential buyer. Relatively new into bikes (although it was founded from a bicycle shop in 1895) the privately-owned Pon bought part of the Finden-Crofts empire last year and, in February, also acquired boutique road bike brand Cerv\u00e9lo of Canada. As Pon owns the rights to Raleigh in Europe, it was a definite maybe in any takeover of the British and US parts of Raleigh. But it was Accell \u2013 eager to deflect Pon \u2013 which got in first. The sale is not yet definite; Pon could still make a better offer. But the smart money is on Accell progressing the deal: the likely purchase price will be in excess of \u00a360m. Few people will notice any difference; Accell is a hands-off manager of its brands. No doubt some jobs will be lost, and Raleigh will shrink again (it was once one of Nottingham&apos;s biggest employers). Raleigh stopped building bike frames in 1999; and the last assembly workers were laid off in 2003. Since then, Raleigh has been a sales and marketing company. The days when it was the world&apos;s dominant bicycle manufacturer are long gone. Raleigh&apos;s recent recovery has to be set against a background of a steady decline since the 1950s, tracking with the reduction in bicycle sales as the nation&apos;s commuters got hooked on cars instead. The Chopper was a 1970s sales blip. Raleigh wasn&apos;t adventurous enough to start, or spot, the next fads. The Nottingham company was late into the mountain bike craze of the 1980s and, over the years, has missed out on many other potential revenue streams: it discontinued production of cars in 1934 and could have bagged the rights to the Biro ballpoint pen in the 1940s. Accell will likely ramp up Raleigh&apos;s back story, a Dutch company focusing on a proud English heritage, a heritage too often ignored by the company itself. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/06/malawi-president-reported-dead", "publicationDate": "2012-04-06T15:30:27Z", "tags": ["Malawi", "Africa", "World news"], "sentences": ["As foreign minister she oversaw the severing of relations with Taiwan after 41 years to switch to China for &quot;economic benefits&quot;."], "title": "Malawi faces power struggle after president reported dead", "article": "Malawi could be facing a dangerous power struggle after the government refused to confirm widespread reports that president Bingu wa Mutharika had died from a heart attack. The 78-year-old was taken to hospital in the capital, Lilongwe, on Thursday after collapsing but was dead on arrival, medical and government sources told Reuters. His body was flown to South Africa because Malawi&apos;s energy crisis is so severe that the hospital would have been unable to carry out a proper autopsy or even keep his body refrigerated, they added. In South Africa he would be embalmed. The Malawian government&apos;s prolonged silence on the president&apos;s condition raised fears of an attempt to subvert the constitution in the southern African country, said to be sliding towards tyranny and economic disaster on Mutharika&apos;s watch. &quot;Malawi&apos;s constitution lays out a clear path for succession and we expect it to be observed. We are concerned about the delay in the transfer of power,&quot; the US state department said in a statement. &quot;We trust that the vice president who is next in line will be sworn in shortly.&quot; Joyce Banda, vice-president since 2009, is first in line to take over and become Malawi&apos;s first female president. The award-winning gender activist, who turns 62 next week, founded the National Association of Business Women of Malawi. Married to retired chief justice Richard Banda, she went into politics in 1999. As foreign minister she oversaw the severing of relations with Taiwan after 41 years to switch to China for &quot;economic benefits&quot;. But Banda was expelled from the ruling Democratic Progressive party in 2010 in a row over succession. She set up her own People&apos;s party and recently told the BBC she had not spoken to Mutharika for more than a year. Mutharika launched a constitutional court case to determine whether a sitting vice-president can lead an opposition political party that fields candidates against the ruling party. He also appeared to be grooming his brother Peter, who is foreign minister and has deputised in his absence, to replace him. On Friday Malawi&apos;s &quot;inner circle&quot; of senior ministers \u2013 including Peter Mutharika \u2013 was reportedly holding meetings on how to thwart Banda&apos;s ascent. They were said to be seeking to convene an emergency parliament session that would change the constitution to allow for the selection of a new leader until elections due in 2014. Malawian lawyers told the Guardian that the question of Banda ascending to the state house was &quot;automatic&quot;. Sources said that when chief justice Lovemore Munlo was approached he told them it was impossible not to give power to Banda, saying this would be the same as staging a coup. Retired president Bakili Muluzi, who has been fighting a corruption trial for the past four years instigated by Mutharika, said it was automatic the vice-president should take power until 2014. &quot;I am calling for a constitutional order for continued peace and order,&quot; Muluzi told journalists at his residence in Limbe, outside the commercial hub Blantyre. &quot;The laws of Malawi are very clearly that the vice-president takes over. &quot; He added: &quot;We have to avoid a situation where there is disorder. Let us follow the constitution. We have no choice but follow the constitution. It&apos;s very important that there must be peace and calm.&quot; Civil society groups urged a smooth transition. Benedicto Kondowe, executive director of the Civil Society Education Coalition, said: &quot;The constitution very clearly states that the vice-president shall assume power for the remaining term of office. I don&apos;t think the ruling party will manoeuvre because there is no law that can support such a process. I don&apos;t think Malawians are ready for any attempt to bend the constitution.&quot; Banda could bring a welcome shift of direction, Kondowe added. &quot;For sure I think there might be a number of changes. It is not an easy job looking at the political and economic situation, but we hope she may be able to steer the country to what Malawians want. &quot;She has a challenge to transform the image of the country. Regionally and internationally it has been greatly affected. She needs to restore donor confidence in Malawi as a peace loving country.&quot; Mutharika is a former World Bank official once heralded for presiding over an unprecedented run of boom years in one of the world&apos;s poorest countries. He first came to power in 2004 and was re-elected with an overwhelming mandate five years later. But things turned sour and Mutharika was accused of mismanaging the economy and seeking to crush dissent, with rights activists claiming they had been assaulted and intimidated. At least 18 people died when anti-government protests turned violent last year. In his final months he became ever more suspicious and paranoid, telling the Guardian that &quot;foreign enemies&quot; were striving to oust him. He alienated foreign donors who contributed 40% of the national budget. A leaked diplomatic cable from the then-British high commissioner, Fergus Cochrane-Dyet, described him as &quot;becoming ever more autocratic and intolerant of criticism&quot;, resulting in tit-for-tat expulsions The country now has chronic shortages of foreign exchange, medicines and fuel, with drivers forced to abandon their cars overnight in queues at petrol stations. As rumours of the president&apos;s death swept the capital on Thursday night, there were pockets of drunken jubilation among locals. &quot;I am yet to see anyone shedding a tear for Bingu,&quot; Martin Mlenga, a businessman, told Reuters. &quot;We all wished him dead, sorry to say that.&quot; Mutharika has been reported dead before. In an interview with the Guardian in February, he recalled: &quot;Someone said Bingu is dead: government officials are going there to bring his coffin. So I when I came here, I apologised and said, &apos;In my haste to come to Malawi I forgot my casket at the airport; the casket is coming&apos; \u2026 this is supposed to be freedom of the press. It is not. This is freedom to lie.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/06/samsung-wins-smartphones-battle", "publicationDate": "2012-04-06T18:37:47Z", "tags": ["Technology sector", "Business", "Samsung", "Smartphones", "Apple", "Mobile phones", "Technology", "HTC"], "sentences": ["The battle for smartphone supremacy between Asia&apos;s largest handset makers has left profits at Taiwanese firm HTC plummeting as South Korea&apos;s Samsung Electronics rakes in the rewards.", "First quarter net income after tax was 4.46bn New Taiwan dollars (\u00a395m), lower than the NT$4.62bn consensus forecast."], "title": "Samsung comes out top in battle of the smartphones", "article": "The battle for smartphone supremacy between Asia&apos;s largest handset makers has left profits at Taiwanese firm HTC plummeting as South Korea&apos;s Samsung Electronics rakes in the rewards. HTC on Friday reported a 70% year-on-year profit drop, its biggest since listing a decade ago. First quarter net income after tax was 4.46bn New Taiwan dollars (\u00a395m), lower than the NT$4.62bn consensus forecast. In a bruising year, Samsung has emerged as the only one of the larger manufacturers to expand its smartphone business in the face of unstoppable progress from Apple&apos;s iPhone. Samsung&apos;s results, published on the same day as HTC&apos;s, show operating profits doubled from 2.95tn won (\u00a31.6bn) to 5.8tn won in the first quarter, roundly beating forecasts. Gains from selling phones and television sets helped mask a slump in the group&apos;s chip business. Propelled by sales of its Galaxy range, Samsung is thought to have sold 44m smartphones in the three months to 31 March, exceeding Apple&apos;s shipments &quot;by a significant margin&quot; and triple the number reported a year earlier, according to Seoul-based analyst CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. Apple has yet to announce its results for March, but sold 37m iPhones in the Christmas period, just after the launch of its latest model, the 4S. Samsung&apos;s quarterly sales jumped 22% to 45tn won, and operating profit at the telecommunications unit more than doubled to 3.5tn won, according to estimates by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Profits at Samsung&apos;s semiconductor division may have fallen 28% to 1.2tn won on sales of 8.65tn won, estimates Bloomberg. Success with phones has soured Samsung&apos;s relationship with Apple, which is also its biggest customer. The South Korean company makes computer chips and displays for Apple. The two groups have been suing each other in court rooms around the world for patent infringement on phones and tablets. Samsung increased its share of worldwide smartphone sales from 9% to 23% in 2011, according to research firm IDC, while HTC&apos;s share dipped from 8.5% to 6.5%. The only other top six manufacturer to grow was Apple, which emerged with the largest slice at 23.5%, up from 16% at the end of 2010. HTC&apos;s own finance director, Winston Yung, admitted in February the company had made mistakes with new products at the end of last year, saying some of its handsets were too thick and offered insufficient battery life. &quot;We simply dropped the ball on products in the fourth quarter,&quot; Yung said. &quot;The form factor could be better and the product design could be better. So we&apos;ve learned lessons from the fourth quarter products.&quot; HTC&apos;s revenues fell 35% year on year to NT$67.79bn. Founded in 1997, HTC in recent years has switched from making white label phones for mobile networks to manufacturing under its own brand. It enjoyed a fairytale when shares more than tripled in the 14 months to April 2011 and sales grew four-fold. But the Taipei-listed company fell behind during the second half of 2011 and its share price has fallen by 50% in a year."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/07/this-weeks-new-film-events", "publicationDate": "2012-04-06T23:05:31Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "sentences": ["It&apos;s mostly fresh Japanese and South Korean movies, with a few from Taiwan, China and even Burma; Spacey features in Chinese comedy Inseparable."], "title": "This week's new film events", "article": "Italian Film Festival In Scotland The cream of Italy&apos;s recent output is served here, including a host of festival winners.

The third and often forgotten member of the old Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Malawi never secured the headlines like the other two, Zimbabwe and Zambia, but was assiduously cultivated by South Africa during the apartheid years. Under its founding president, Hastings Banda, Malawi became conservative internally with controversial diplomatic links \u2013 a police state under which civil liberties were heavily curtailed. Yet as one of the poorest countries in Africa, with the majority of its population living below the poverty line, it embraced the region&apos;s &quot;political spring&quot; that began in 1991 with the downfall of Kenneth Kaunda in elections in neighbouring Zambia. In 1994 Bakili Muluzi defeated Banda in Malawi&apos;s own elections and set about liberalising the country. He\u00a0won re-election in 1999 but failed in his attempt to change the constitution to allow him to run for a third term. He then handpicked Mutharika to be his successor as leader of the United Democratic Front party. Mutharika was a technocratic choice with an extensive educational and career background. He took a master&apos;s degree in economics in Delhi and subsequently obtained a doctorate from the non-accredited Pacific Western University in California. He was a loans officer at the World Bank, then rose to a\u00a0directorship within the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and became secretary-general of the 22-nation Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa. He was minister of\u00a0economic planning and development at the end of Muluzi&apos;s second term. Mutharika became president of Malawi in 2004, but the United Democratic Front, with its powerful and\u00a0ambitious barons, never took kindly to his elevation by Muluzi. Quarrels broke out, and Mutharika took an unusual step for a national president, leaving his own party to start another. He founded the Democratic Progressive party, with Muluzi apologising for imposing him on the country. The first years of Mutharika&apos;s presidency were, however, stunningly successful. A strong emphasis on agriculture, food security and seed availability led to successive years of\u00a0food surpluses and it seemed that the agricultural sector was being transformed. He founded several universities of agriculture. In foreign policy, he also moved to overhaul previous relationships. He rescinded Malawi&apos;s recognition of Taiwan and in 2007 established diplomatic links with Beijing. In return, China made available an immediate $260m (\u00a3165m) loan and kickstarted a trading relationship whereby China-Malawi trade rose to $100m \u2013 45% of Malawi&apos;s overall trade. China spent $41m on Malawi&apos;s new parliament building and is\u00a0currently constructing a $90m hotel. On the basis of his performance, and in his propagation of greater civil liberties, Mutharika won what were hailed as free and fair elections in 2009. He seemed determined to put Malawi on the international map in his second term. In 2010 Malawi donated 150 tonnes of rice to Haiti following the earthquake there. For a country so\u00a0identified with food shortages, it\u00a0was\u00a0a small but potent gesture. In\u00a02010 Mutharika also became chairman of the African Union and attended G8 and G20 meetings \u2013 even though Malawi was a member of neither \u2013 to foster the image of a technocratic and democratic African leader. He persuaded the African Union to adopt his &quot;African food basket&quot; vision, and later condemned Laurent Gbagbo&apos;s attempt to cling to power in Ivory Coast. However, Mutharika was also at the forefront of African leaders who condemned the international criminal court for indicting President Omar al-Bashir of\u00a0Sudan, claiming such actions impinged on\u00a0Africa&apos;s self-governance. After 2010, however, Mutharika&apos;s behaviour and reputation began to change dramatically. Like his predecessor, he began contemplating the constitutional changes that would allow him to run for a third term. As\u00a0the\u00a0international recession took hold, and the knock-on effects were felt in Malawi, fuel shortages and increased urban unemployment led to street protests. The president&apos;s response was violent and civil liberties once again seemed insecure. He became increasingly volatile in his public statements, claiming peace and liberty amid clearly\u00a0visible steps towards repression. In\u00a02011, protesters were shot dead by\u00a0police in the northern cities of\u00a0Karonga and Mzuzu. His first wife, Ethel Zvauya, died in 2007. He is survived by their four children and by his second wife, Callista Chapola-Chimombo. \u2022 Bingu wa Mutharika, president of Malawi, born 24 February 1934; died 5\u00a0April 2012"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/apr/10/lobbying-all-party-groups-parliament", "publicationDate": "2012-04-10T18:00:00Z", "tags": ["Politics", "Lobbying", "House of Commons", "House of Lords"], "sentences": ["Highlights from the story include APPGs receiving donations amounting to a total of \u00a31.8 million, including:  \u2022 Trips to 27 countries including China, Morocco, Azerbaijan, Taiwan, Thailand, Israel and Lichenstein for members of 15 groups\u2022 A \u00a332,000 donation from BT Global Services to fund concerts for the parliamentary choir\u2022 Contributions totalling more than \u00a3117,000 for &quot;associate membership&quot; at \u00a38,400 a time of the all-party group on health, from companies including AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline and Milliman\u2022 Free membership of Slimming World or WeightWatchers for MPs and Lords."], "title": "Donations to all-party parliamentary groups: get the data", "article": "While open data is making progress across the web, it still has a long way to go when it comes to not only recording and centralising all the different ways outside groups can sponsor or donate to politicians.

The US Congress is not far behind, with the Republican leadership pledging to pass an authorisation for the use of &quot;overwhelming military force&quot; if there are signs Iran is developing a nuclear weapon.  Barack Obama is more cautious, but says the &quot;military option&quot; remains on the table if sanctions fail to persuade Tehran to give up its enriched uranium. But while intelligence agencies grapple to assess whether Tehran is attempting to develop a nuclear weapon and militaries on both sides of the Atlantic consider the logistics of bombing Iran, legal authorities are confronting the challenge of constructing a legal case for attack, if it comes.  And already there is considerable dispute over the issue.  Alan Dershowitz, the renowned jurist and supporter of Israel, has argued that the US and the Jewish state can invoke a long-standing right under customary international law of &quot;pro-active self-defence&quot; as well as article 51 of the United Nations charter.  Sceptics counter that international law only permits military action in response to an imminent attack, or if one is under way. They say there is no immediate threat because, as the White House has said, there is no evidence Tehran is building a nuclear weapon.  Then there are those who argue that the legal grounds for a military assault have already been met because the US and Israel are already under attack from &quot;terrorist organisations&quot; sponsored by Iran.  There is considerable support among politicians who favour an attack on Iran for the view of Anthony D&apos;Amato, a professor in international law at Northwestern University, who has argued cases before the European Court of Human Rights. He says using force to prevent Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon would uphold international law, not undermine it. &quot;Iran says it wants to push the Israelis into the sea and that they are constructing nuclear weapons. That&apos;s enough for me to say that cannot be allowed. If the US or Israel takes the initiative to block that action, it can hardly be said to be violating international law. It can only be preserving international law for future generations,&quot; he said.  &quot;In order to preserve international law we have to defend it once in while. I think we have to defend it against rogue states or states that have expressed a hostile intentions, like Iran and like North Korea. The only reasonable thing to do is to take those weapons out. Remove that threat and the world is going to be safer.&quot; But D&apos;Amato&apos;s view is scorned by other specialists in international law.  Much of the the legal argument centres on the interpretation of one word: imminent. Although the United Nations charter recognises the right of self-defence, it is imprecise. Lawyers look beyond the charter to an older standard in customary international law, established in the 19th century, allowing one state to use force to preempt an imminent attack by another. That came out of a cross-border raid by British forces into New York state in 1837 to destroy an American ship, the SS Caroline, which was delivering aid to a rebellion in Canada. The British raiding party set fire to the Caroline and cast her adrift toward Niagara Falls. One American was killed. In the ensuing diplomatic battle, London and Washington agreed on a treaty providing for a right of pre-emptive self-defence \u2013 more commonly spoken of today as a pre-emptive strike \u2013 but only when there is &quot;instant, overwhelming&quot; necessity, &quot;leaving no choice of means, and no moment of deliberation&quot;. That formula has long been regarded as an integral part of international law, but there are wide differences over how the &quot;Caroline test&quot; would apply to a US or Israeli attack on Iran.  D&apos;Amato said the threat is imminent because of Tehran&apos;s rhetoric against Israel. He said the US and Israel are also entitled to act under a clause in the UN charter \u2013 article 2, paragraph 4 \u2013 requiring countries to refrain from &quot;the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state&quot;. &quot;Let&apos;s ask the question: who would be violating that clause? Would it be the United States&apos; attack on Iran or would it be Iran&apos;s threat against Israel? Who is the violator here? If Iran is in a war to the death with Israel, as they claim they are, and they are also preparing nuclear weapons against a small state, I think any reasonable person would look at that and say they are in violation of article 2 section 4 of the charter,&quot; he said. But Kevin Heller, author of The Nuremberg Military Tribunals and the Origins of International Criminal Law, and who served as Human Rights Watch&apos;s external legal advisor on Saddam Hussein&apos;s trial, is dismissive of D&apos;Amato&apos;s interpretation. &quot;To say that argument is profoundly flawed is an understatement. It may well be that by threatening the use of force Iran is in breach of the UN charter. But that couldn&apos;t possibly justify a military response,&quot; he said. Heller said that whatever threat Iran my pose, it is not &quot;imminent&quot;, as required by the Caroline test.  &quot;In terms of Iran, I don&apos;t even think it&apos;s enough under the UN charter for the US to say Iran has a nuclear weapon. At a minimum, they would actually have to have a nuclear weapon, and they would have to issue some kind of concrete threat to use it against Israel or some other country before a military response would be acceptable,&quot; he said. Bruce Ackerman, an influential constitutional law professor at Yale, is similarly sceptical of any claim of an imminent threat.  &quot;The idea that the United States is under imminent threat from Iran is preposterous. It is not preposterous that Israel&apos;s under threat from Iran. It just isn&apos;t imminent,&quot; he said. Ackerman said interpretations of the UN charter have evolved to permit the use of force in situations such as a &quot;duty to protect&quot; where there are large scale abuses of human rights. &quot;Those arguments were begun most obviously in the Kosovo matter and continued with Libya, although in the Libyan case there was an express United Nations security council authorisation. It also arises in Syria right now. But Iran is not that kind of case,&quot; he said.  &quot;Similarly, this is not a case having to do with the war on terror. It&apos;s a case in which one sovereign feels threatened by another sovereign. It&apos;s just the kind of thing that has been happening for a very long time and it was precisely this kind of anticipatory anxiety generating wars that the League of Nations and then the United Nations was intended to respond to.&quot; Critics of the argument that the US and Israel have the right to pre-empt Iran&apos;s attempts to build a nuclear weapon \u2013 something it says it is not doing \u2013 point to Washington&apos;s reaction to the Israeli attack on Iraq&apos;s nuclear reactor at Osirak 31 years ago.  That was condemned not only by the rightwing Reagan administration but by Margaret Thatcher, and drew a unanimous condemnation in the UN security council.  But the politics has evolved since then. When Israel attacked a Syrian nuclear facility five years ago, it did not draw a whisper of criticism in Washington or London. John Brennan, the White House counter-terrorism chief, has argued for a more flexible interpretation of &quot;imminence&quot; in the context of pre-emptive strikes because of the threat from terrorism. Supporters of an attack on Iran say that any reinterpretation could equally apply to &quot;rogue states&quot; or those that sponsor terrorism.  Others have proposed that the US and Israel justify an assault as self-defence because Iran has already attacked both countries through Tehran-backed groups such as Hezbollah. Dershowitz has said that Israel can already justify an attack on those grounds and that the US could likely construct a similar case. &quot;If Israel were compelled to act alone against Iran&apos;s nuclear programme, it too would be reacting as well as pre-empting, since Iran has effectively declared war against the Jewish state and its people,&quot; he wrote in the Wall Street Journal. Heller is sceptical. &quot;Iran doesn&apos;t have the kind of overall and effective control over Hamas and Hezbollah that would make their actions imputable to Iran, justifying self-defence,&quot; he said. &quot;But even if they did, just because there may be an armed attack on Israel by Hamas doesn&apos;t mean you can take out a country&apos;s nuclear programme. There has to be some kind of necessity and proportionality between the armed attack and the response.&quot; The legal niceties are unlikely to stop the US or Israel if they are determined to attack Iran. The Bush and Obama administrations both shopped around within their own legal departments until they got the advice they wanted to hear on issues from invading Iraq to the growing government surveillance of ordinary Americans.  But Ackerman notes that riding roughshod over international law carries dangers. For a start, Iran could make a reasonable case that it is the one under threat, with all of the bellicose rhetoric out of Washington and Jerusalem \u2013 and therefore it has a right of pre-emptive self-defence.  &quot;Where does this kind of radically expanded notion of pre-emptive attack stop?&quot; asked Ackerman. &quot;What&apos;s going to happen when China feels threatened by Taiwan, or India by Pakistan, or vice versa? We would be setting a precedent here which be a very serious blow to the rule of international law.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/16/militarisation-of-cyberspace-power-struggle", "publicationDate": "2012-04-16T14:00:00Z", "tags": ["Cybercrime", "Computing", "Technology", "US military", "Espionage", "US news", "World news", "China", "UK news"], "sentences": ["It is, he says, China&apos;s way of saying: &quot;Don&apos;t send the 7th fleet to save Taiwan, or we will take out the electricity supply in Los Angeles&quot;."], "title": "Militarisation of cyberspace: how the global power struggle moved online", "article": "Jonathan Millican is a first-year university student from Harrogate in North Yorkshire. He says he doesn&apos;t think of himself as a &quot;stereotypical geek&quot;, but having been crowned champion in Britain&apos;s Cyber Security Challenge, the 19-year-old is bound to take some stick from his undergraduate friends at Cambridge. The competition is not well known, but it is well contested. About 4,000 people applied to take part this year, hundreds were seen by judges, and 30 were selected for the final in Bristol on 10 March. After a day of fighting off hackers and identifying viruses in a series of simulations, Millican triumphed, giving him legitimate claim to be the brightest young computer whiz in the UK. And though he may not recognise it yet, Millican has become a small player in a global game. There is a dotted line that links him to an ideological battle over the future of the internet, and the ways states will use it to prosecute conflicts in the 21st century. The remaining cold war superpower, the United States, is slowly squaring up to the emerging behemoth, China, in a sphere in which Beijing has a distinct advantage: cyberspace. Experts estimate China has as many &quot;cyber jedis&quot; as the US has engineers, and some of them, with backing from the state, have been systematically hacking into and stealing from governments and companies in the west, taking defence secrets, compromising computer systems, and scanning energy and water plants for potential vulnerabilities. The scale of what has been going on is only now being recognised, and with a discernible sense of panic, the US and the UK are trying to make up lost ground. One important way of shoring up the west&apos;s defences involves recruiting a rival army of computer specialists to defend the systems being attacked. This is why the UK began the Cyber Security Challenge in 2011, and why Millican and otherparticipants have been discreetly courted by GCHQ, the government&apos;s electronic eavesdropping centre, which is on the frontline of this new power struggle. The explosion in internet use, and the almost complete reliance on computer systems to run and record our daily lives, has opened up endless opportunities for thieves, spies and vandals to exploit the platform. Though it is still evolving, the push-back has started. The Guardian has spoken to senior officials in the US and UK government, as well as specialists and independent thinktanks in London, Washington and San Francisco, who agree that the west is galvanising itself to adopt a far more aggressive approach to a problem for which there is no precedent. The stakes have suddenly become very high. Over the past 18 months, there has been a concerted effort to highlight the relentless nature of day-to-day attacks on businesses and government departments. The Obama administration estimates that 60% of small firms that are hacked go broke, and billions of dollars worth of intellectual property have been stolen from industry, including military blueprints from leading defence contractors. And in the political shadows in Westminster and Washington, they have moved to put cyberspace more formally into the military sphere, so that those responsible for the attacks understand that retaliation is now part of the game. New military battleground Though much maligned, Britain&apos;s 2010 strategic defence and security review may prove to have been a historic punctuation mark in this process. The review made the threats from cyberspace a &quot;tier one&quot; priority, because Downing Street considered them a genuine threat to national security. The US is moving in this direction, too. On 17 January, the head of the US military, General Martin Dempsey, set out a significant change in position. In a 70-page document that was largely ignored and almost completely impenetrable, he said the US intended to treat cyberspace as a military battleground. &quot;Disrupting the enemy will require the full inclusion of space and cyberspace operations into the traditional air-land-sea battle space\u00a0\u2026 [They have] critical importance for the projection of military force. Arguably, this emergence is the most important and fundamental change \u2026 over the past several decades.&quot; The military has long had basic cyber capabilities, such as equipment for jamming signals, but the more sophisticated weapons are seldom spoken of, and rarely used, in part because there has been no formal code of conduct. This has prevented the US from routinely deploying its most destructive cyberweapons, including during the Libya campaign last year, when the Pentagon gave President Obama the option of disabling Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s military computer network with a targeted cyber-attack. The White House decided against it, but the Dempsey doctrine will give the president, and General Keith Alexander, the head of US Cyber Command, more confidence next time. Officials in the US and the UK privately concede they have been developing a range of new &quot;offensive&quot; cyberweapons \u2013 and a rulebook for their use. &quot;If we know that someone is about to launch a cyber-attack on us, then we will pre-empt it,&quot; said one Whitehall official. &quot;We have that capability and we will use it, even if the bad actors are based abroad.&quot; The state department now regards cybersecurity &quot;as a foreign policy priority&quot;, and Obama administration officials insist &quot;the laws of conflict apply to cyberspace&quot;. &quot;If there is significant information of a cyber-event, we reserve the right to use tools in our toolbox,&quot; said one. &quot;When does a cyber-attack achieve critical level? When one can attribute an attack that deliberately causes loss of life.&quot; Paul Rosenzweig, who spent four years as deputy assistant secretary in the department of homeland security until 2010, is sceptical that a cyber-only war will happen soon. But he added: &quot;We may have cyberwar as part of another war. I would hope and pray and assume that they [China] are as worried about that as we are.&quot; Frank Cilluffo, President George Bush&apos;s special assistant for homeland security at the time of the 9/11 attacks, said: &quot;In cyber, we are where the counter-terrorist community was on September 12, 2001. &quot;I have come to the conclusion that we can no longer firewall our way out of the problem. We need to talk about offensive capabilities to deter bad actors. I don&apos;t think that you are going to see warfare without a cyber dimension in the future\u00a0\u2026 that is a given. I think warfare as we think of it today will take on these dimensions.&quot; With a buildup of cyberweaponry on both sides, Russia and China have called for negotiations to start on new treaties to govern what is permissible in the domain. The Russians, in particular, have favoured arms control-style agreements, and last September Moscow and Beijing formally proposed to the UN a new international code that would standardise behaviour on the internet. That has been flatly rejected by the UK and the US. They argue arms control treaties won&apos;t work because it will be almost impossible to verify the weapons each state has \u2013 computer viruses are more easily hidden than nuclear missiles. And the new international code, the Foreign Office argues, is simply an attempt by Russia and China to stifle free speech on the internet in their own countries. &quot;It is too late for new formal treaties,&quot; said one senior source in the Ministry of Defence. &quot;If we go down that road it will be years before anything emerges. This is China and Russia trying to kick the issue into the long grass.&quot; But the alternative is almost as far-fetched, and perhaps more nebulous. The foreign secretary, William Hague, has been calling for countries to agree a &quot;rules of the road&quot; in cyberspace, with respect for international law, rights to privacy, and protection of intellectual property at their core. This puts huge emphasis on goodwill between countries and the harmonisation of existing laws to make it easier for investigators to cross international boundaries. It is as unpalatable to China and Russia as their ideas are to the west. &quot;It&apos;s not at a point where I would call it cyberwar yet, but it&apos;s close,&quot; said Larry Clinton, president of the Internet Security Alliance, which represents a group of multinational companies, including many in the defence and aviation sectors. &quot;I think we are certainly seeing an arms race with respect to cyber. We did well to get through the nuclear age. We did well with chemical weapons. If we can do as well with cyber, that would be great, but we don&apos;t really have a theory; I am not sure what the theory is. We don&apos;t have a model set up for how we are going to deal with this.&quot; Private fears Developing cyberweapons, and a methodology for using them, is only one part of this complex new puzzle. Though government departments are continually under attack, it is private industry that suffers most from hackers. The frightening scale of the theft of intellectual property, and the potential knock-on effect for fragile economies, underpinned the UK&apos;s decision to say it must now be regarded as a genuine threat to national security. This, in turn, is forcing governments to expand the boundaries of what might trigger a military response to include theft, albeit on a massive scale. Rosenzweig estimates that 85-90% of the US&apos;s digital infrastructure is in private hands. &quot;I am pretty sure it&apos;s the same in Europe.&quot; Though it is hard to make calculations, one survey last year commissioned by the Cabinet Office estimated the UK economy lost \u00a327bn to cybertheft in 2010. In America, they gave up trying to calculate precise values nine years ago, when the number of known &quot;cyber-intrusions&quot; reached 100,000 in a year; one respected Washington thinktank put the cost of cybertheft in the US last year at roughly $100bn (\u00a363bn). America&apos;s biggest companies have spent a similar amount beefing up their cybersecurity in the past five years, but analysts say this hasn&apos;t been enough to prevent &quot;significant military losses&quot; involving stealth, nuclear weapon and submarine technology, though none of the companies involved will admit it. Without giving away details, Shawn Henry, executive assistant director at the FBI, confirmed that military networks and defence contractors had been hit hard by hackers. &quot;A tremendous amount of information has been stolen from those networks by a variety of state actors.&quot; But there is another dimension of cyber-espionage which is, in some ways, more disturbing. &quot;We know that Russia and China have done the reconnaissance necessary to plan to attack US critical infrastructure,&quot; said Jim Lewis, from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington thinktank. Lewis was commissioned by Bush in 2008 to write a cyber strategy for the government, which is still regarded as a benchmark. &quot;You might think we should put protection of critical infrastructure at a slightly higher level. It is completely vulnerable. It is totally unprotected. &quot;This isn&apos;t made up. I have been doing this for a long time. We know that people have done the reconnaissance, we know that control systems can issue commands to destroy critical infrastructure. We know all this and we have done nothing to defend ourselves\u00a0\u2026 We have been trying for about seven years to deter people and it doesn&apos;t work.&quot; Henry admitted his agency was now dealing with thousands of attacks every month. The agency has people in 63 countries specifically to deal with online threats. &quot;We recognise that there are vulnerabilities in infrastructure,&quot; he said. &quot;There are thousands of breaches every month across industry and retail infrastructure. We know that the capabilities of foreign states are substantial and we know the type of information that they are targeting.&quot; He added: &quot;We have seen adversaries that have been in networks for many months, or even years in some cases, undetected. They have essentially had free rein over those networks \u2026 looking at information that is transiting that network, with the ability not only to review that data, but potentially to change that data. They have complete ability to disrupt that network entirely.&quot; Henry said attacks were becoming much more sophisticated. &quot;Every step that the defence makes, the offence changes its tactics.&quot; Rosenzweig believes this mapping of critical infrastructure \u2013 such as energy or water plants \u2013 is seen within government as &quot;preparation of the battlefield&quot;. It is, he says, China&apos;s way of saying: &quot;Don&apos;t send the 7th fleet to save Taiwan, or we will take out the electricity supply in Los Angeles&quot;. The US is using the Idaho National Laboratory to run simulations testing the robustness of America&apos;s most important computer networks, but these take time. With so much at stake, the Obama administration is pushing for proper domestic regulation and standards in cybersecurity, but that is being resisted by private companies, even though it may force them to close the gaps that are being exploited. Three competing bills are currently vying for votes in Congress, including one from the former presidential candidate John McCain, who wants to fend off government oversight, and the prospect of companies being fined \u2013 or sued \u2013 if their cyber defences don&apos;t come up to scratch. The role of China Though the arguments are running along party lines, there is no argument about the fundamental problem, and where it is sourced from. &quot;Anyone who is significant on either side of the aisle is running around with their hair on fire,&quot; said Rosenzweig. &quot;The influential voices on both sides are saying it&apos;s a problem. It&apos;s a real problem and it&apos;s a real problem right now. General Keith Alexander [head of US Cyber Command] says he is seeing it, and he&apos;s not the sort of guy to make things up.&quot; There is no doubt about the main culprit, says Rosenzweig. &quot;China denies it \u2013 but this is one of the bald-faced lies that people get away with because we don&apos;t want to face the consequences. China has more computer programmers than the west has engineers. &quot;Not everyone is a cyber jedi. But if you have 1 million computer programmers, you will find 1,000 jedis. We have a lot of IT professionals but they aren&apos;t the same thing; we don&apos;t understand the culture.&quot; Dmitri Alperovitch, one of the world&apos;s foremost independent cybersecurity analysts, said: &quot;The Chinese clearly have no restraints when it comes to espionage. &quot;In the US, economic espionage by either private sector or government is prohibited by policy and the Chinese are certainly not constrained by such measures. When it comes to volumes and sheer scale, no one even comes close to them.&quot; The audaciousness of some of the attacks has been astounding. Earlier this month, Nasa&apos;s inspector general, Paul Martin, revealed the space agency&apos;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory headquarters in Pasadena, California, had been compromised by an attack that appeared to come from China. The JPL manages 23 spacecraft, including missions to Jupiter, Saturn and Mars, and controls the International Space Station. In remarkable testimony to Congress, Martin said hackers had &quot;gained full system access&quot; to JPL, allowing them to modify, copy, or delete sensitive files, create new ones, and upload hacking tools to compromise other Nasa systems. In short, they were running the network. This was only one of 47 cyber-attacks on Nasa last year, 13 of which successfully compromised the agency&apos;s firewalls. Martin said some of the intrusions &quot;may have been sponsored by foreign intelligence services seeking to further their countries&apos; objectives&quot;. There is debate on how effective, and for how long, a cyber-attack from China could knock out an energy supply or communications hub. Larry Clinton said it would not be easy, but it would be foolish to think it was not possible. &quot;Older technologies tend to be safer than newer technologies. Copper wire is more secure than fibre. And the problem is the interconnections. We don&apos;t have nearly the degree of air-gapping that we once did. &quot;You can get into a weapons system and you won&apos;t even know that system is compromised until you set it off and then it comes back and hits you in the face\u00a0\u2026 the sort of attacks that were considered sophisticated six years ago are considered elementary now.&quot; If the threat is that great, and the belief that China is behind it so widely held, why hasn&apos;t the US been more robust in condemning Beijing? It&apos;s a question the state department refuses to answer. It will not even say if it has used normal diplomatic means \u2013 summoning an ambassador or expelling someone from the embassy. Melissa Hathaway, who was director of the Joint Interagency Cyber Task Force under Bush and was on the National Security Council in the first year of the Obama administration, thinks the reticence is understandable. &quot;We need to think about our roles and the economic future of the world. What would you like the future of the economy to look like? Quite honestly, right now we are all dependent on China. All of us. &quot;They have bought a lot of European debt, they have bought a lot of US debt. They are helping to promote world stability right now.&quot; The US has been pursuing another route to the Chinese, reaching out to Beijing using thinktanks as proxies, and engaging them in &quot;cyberwar&quot; games. It is the only chance the Pentagon and the state department get to sit across the table from their Chinese counterparts, to express their own fears, and to hear those of China. One hope is that the talks will lead to an equivalent of a &quot;nuclear hotline&quot; from Washington to Beijing, so leaders can talk before a situation gets out of control. While the US may be pleased it is finally getting its message across, Lewis isn&apos;t convinced the Chinese are listening. And he doesn&apos;t think they will stop their activity in cyberspace either. He has been dealing with the Chinese military for years, and says the People&apos;s Liberation Army is hostile. &quot;They see the US as a target. They feel they have justification for their actions. There is a sense that China has been treated unfairly, and so they have a right to catch up. Britain and France may have burned the summer palace, but the US has become the symbol of imperialism. And they think the US is in decline.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/apr/19/cross-border-financial-regulation-justified", "publicationDate": "2012-04-19T11:05:24Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Dilma Rousseff", "Brazil", "Americas", "World news", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Global recession", "Global economy", "Economics", "Business"], "sentences": ["Many other emerging market and developing countries, such as South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan and Peru have also been regulating the inflows of speculative capital over the past few years."], "title": "Cross-border financial regulation is justified now more than ever | Kevin Gallagher", "article": "Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff has been travelling the world in recent weeks to tell industrialised nations to stop the &quot;tsunami&quot; of speculative capital flowing into her country. Low interest rates and slow growth in the global north, when coupled with relatively high interest rates and fast growth in the global south, creates the environment for investors to pull money from rich countries and to speculate on the south. This has caused the value of developing-country currencies to appreciate \u2013 making it harder for companies and farmers to export, and thus causing job losses and a general lack of competitiveness. Speculative capital flows are also raising the price of stock, bond and real-estate markets \u2013 threatening to create bubbles such as the one experienced in the US in 2008. Rouseff&apos;s government has started regulating cross-border finance, and so should industrialised nations. Brazil&apos;s currency appreciated by more than 40% between 2009 and 2011 \u2013 so much so that there are amplified concerns about &quot;de-industrialisation&quot;. Their exports are becoming so expensive that the country&apos;s manufacturing base is seriously under threat. Over the past three years, Brazil has taxed stocks, bonds and derivatives purchases from abroad. Many other emerging market and developing countries, such as South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan and Peru have also been regulating the inflows of speculative capital over the past few years. But they are struggling. A lack of north-south co-operation, and a web of trade and investment treaties, make it more difficult for some southern nations to regulate and for many northern countries to co-operate. The IMF Articles of Agreement grant nations the leeway to regulate cross-border capital flows and also enable north-south co-operation to stem the tide. The lack of co-operation on the part of the global north is ironic, given that low interest rates in the developed world are in place to try to spur growth and employment within them. Unfortunately, investors choose to borrow at low interest rates and speculate in developing countries. Thus the countries that need the investment for recovery do not receive it and the countries that are close to overheating receive too much. Some nations that probably should be deploying regulations on capital flows are not because they violate recent trade and investment treaties. Brazil has repeatedly put in place taxes and other measure on capital inflows; neighbouring nations such as Chile and Colombia have not \u2013 in part because Chile and Colombia have trade treaties with the US that require all capital flowing between borders moves &quot;freely and without delay&quot;. Brazil does not have a treaty with the US. A new high-level taskforce, that I co-chair with Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ocampo and Stephany Griffith-Jones, argues that regulating cross-border finance is justified now more than ever. As IMF leaders gather in Washington this week they should reiterate that individual nations have the right to regulate unstable capital flows; that industrialised countries such as the US have to share some of the responsibility and co-operate on the other end of those regulations. Moreover, the IMF should address the extent to which numerous trade and investment treaties violate the IMF Articles of Agreement. As nations attempt to recover from this crisis and prevent the next one, they need all the leeway and co-operation they can harness."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/tokyo-governor-senkaku-islands-china", "publicationDate": "2012-04-19T13:11:00Z", "tags": ["Japan", "China", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Senkaku Islands"], "sentences": ["I believe they not only damage the overall state of China-Japan relations, but also harm Japan&apos;s international image.&quot; A foreign ministry spokesman in Taiwan, which also claims the islands, said Ishihara&apos;s plan was totally unacceptable."], "title": "Tokyo's rightwing governor plans to buy disputed Senkaku Islands", "article": "The governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, has angered China after announcing plans to buy a group of islands at the centre of a long-running territorial dispute.

I believe they not only damage the overall state of China-Japan relations, but also harm Japan&apos;s international image.&quot; A foreign ministry spokesman in Taiwan, which also claims the islands, said Ishihara&apos;s plan was totally unacceptable. Sovereignty over the island has long been a source of friction between China and Japan, where concern is rising over Beijing&apos;s increasingly robust naval presence in the East China Sea. A 2008 agreement to jointly develop gas fields in the area has made little headway and Japan has accused China of drilling unilaterally. Relations reached their lowest point in years in 2010, when a Chinese trawler collided with two Japanese coastguard vessels near the islands. The trawler&apos;s captain was released after a short detention, angering Japanese hawks who believe he should have been prosecuted. Ishihara&apos;s gesture is also directed at Japan&apos;s centrist prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, whom he has accused of failing to protect the country&apos;s territorial interests for fear of upsetting China. Noda has since indicated that the state is considering buying the islands, a move that would further enrage China. &quot;We would like to keep all options open,&quot; he said in parliament. Conservative online commenters applauded Ishihara&apos;s audacity, but the left-leaning Asahi Shimbun accused him of jeopardising Japan&apos;s relations with a vital trading partner. &quot;Even though Ishihara is the governor of the capital of Japan, he is in no position to settle an international territorial dispute,&quot; the paper said in an editorial. &quot;We can only call him irresponsible for talking big, fully knowing its negative impact on Japan&apos;s diplomacy.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/apr/26/aid-africa-brics-countries-traditional", "publicationDate": "2012-04-26T09:30:01Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Aid", "The future of development", "Africa", "World news"], "sentences": ["China insists its partners ditch recognition of Taiwan, and its spending in Africa is heavily focused on resource-rich countries such as Sudan."], "title": "Does aid to Africa from Brics countries differ from traditional aid? | Jonathan Glennie", "article": "It is not original to remark that there is a modern-day scramble for Africa taking place. Economic growth averaging around 5% on the continent for the past decade is certainly good news compared with two decades of increasing poverty. But on the other side of the coin are the reasons for that growth: the large-scale export of commodities with no clear industrial or institutional benefits. &quot;Jobless growth&quot;, the source of the uprisings in north Africa, is the norm in Africa, and although manufacturing exports quadrupled to over $100bn in the last decade, manufacturing is actually declining as a proportion of GDP from a fairly stable 17% between 1965 and 1990 to 13% today. Clearly African countries need to think hard about their development strategies and how best to take advantage of the changing global context. Is the ever-growing interest in Africa&apos;s land and resources its route out of poverty, or are we seeing dependency theory in action, with resources being extracted with little resembling sustainable development left behind? A recent article on the impact of oil wealth in Chad bears out this complex picture. Although trade and investment will ultimately be far more important, a changing African aidscape will also play a part in the continent&apos;s future. What is the role of aid in this context? What are its motives? And are some aid partners better than others? The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, certainly seems to think so, urging poor countries at an aid conference in Busan, South Korea, to &quot;be wary of donors who are more interested in extracting your resources than in building your capacity&quot;. It is hard to imagine a more absurd statement from a US official, given the country&apos;s leading role in previous scrambles for Africa \u2013 not to mention its weak record (with other donors) of &quot;building capacity&quot; over more than 50 years of aid-giving. From the cold war to aid conditionality supporting its own interests, to the pouring of money into the Horn of Africa after the 9/11 attacks, the US pretty much wrote the book on how to use aid to ensure strategic interests. Clinton should remember John Kennedy&apos;s assertion in 1962: &quot;Aid is a method by which the United States maintains a position of influence and control around the world \u2026 I put it right at the top of the essential programmes in protecting the security of the free world.&quot; While Clinton tries to deny reality, the Brics countries are engaged in their own propaganda, claiming their &quot;south-south co-operation&quot;, which often explicitly links aid with trade, places a new emphasis on mutual benefit, solidarity and self-reliance. Are they right? Many African leaders appear to think so. According to Ethiopia&apos;s prime minister, Meles Zenawi: &quot;China, its amazing re-emergence and its commitment for a win-win partnership with Africa, is one of the reasons for the beginning of the African renaissance.&quot; Brazil, another Brics country, is at the forefront of the south-south rhetoric, insisting that far from eschewing capacity building, as Clinton claims, its co-operation is entirely focused on it. But Brazil&apos;s trade with Africa, which grew five-fold between 2002 and 2009, follows distinctly colonial patterns, as Padraig Carmody says in his book The New Scramble for Africa \u2013 Brazil exports manufactured goods and food to Africa, while Africa provides Brazil with oil and coal. So where does the truth lie? First, the OECD&apos;s development assistance committee (DAC) and Brics categories are not necessarily that useful \u2013 neither is a homogenous group. Brazilian aid has little in common with Chinese aid: it is relatively miniscule and focuses on technology and capacity, while China&apos;s huge aid budget funds infrastructure. Russia is totally different again, and South Africa is still close to irrelevant in aid terms, with a budget of under $100m. Nor does Norwegian aid resemble US aid in any significant way, despite signing up to the same DAC ways of working. In some important ways it can be more useful to separate western (US and Europe) style aid from eastern (Korean, Japanese and Chinese). The latter are generally less interested in policy conditionality and more focused on infrastructure, while the former have a strong tendency to conditionalise aid, while focusing, at least in the MDG era, on social sectors. Of western donors, only Germany spent more than 15% of its aid on infrastructure in 2009-10, while South Korea and Japan both spent over 40%, and China 60%. The appearance of China, India and Brazil on the scene, coupled with the dire problems in western economies, has transformed the political landscape. These three countries, along with South Africa, are steeped in an anti-imperialist tradition and ideology that promotes self-reliance and partnership over the faux charity of colonial powers, which give with one hand and crush with the other. They also have a greater familiarity with the political and economic conditions of developing countries, probably an advantage both commercially and in terms of promoting development. Their growing prominence is a welcome balance to the deeply ingrained arrogance of western donors. However, this difference can easily be exaggerated. India and China are clearly using aid money to achieve political interests and economic advantage, in similar ways to traditional donors. China insists its partners ditch recognition of Taiwan, and its spending in Africa is heavily focused on resource-rich countries such as Sudan. India uses credit lines to promote its exports and focuses on the energy sector, as the world&apos;s fifth-largest energy consumer. Even South Africa, once the cause celebre of anti-imperialism, has become something of an imperial presence in many less powerful countries in Africa. According to Unctad, over 50% of foreign investment in Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, Malawi and Swaziland comes from South Africa. As it grows in power, it is more than likely that its new aid programme will come to the service of such strategic investments. Is foreign investment vital for growth, or a tool for resource extraction? Is aid solidarity or bribery? All donors, DAC or Brics, old or new, have mixed motives \u2013 part goodwill, part strategic interest. African countries would be foolish to believe the rhetoric of traditional or emerging partners, and should base their aid management strategies on a realistic assessment of the incentives and intentions of all entities that arrive at their airports bearing gifts."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/apr/26/smaller-countries-economic-change", "publicationDate": "2012-04-26T16:19:45Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Business", "World news", "Chile", "Americas", "Kazakhstan", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific", "Tunisia", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "Jordan", "KPMG"], "sentences": ["But Chile, Tunisia, Taiwan, Jordan and Kazakhstan have been identified as the possible rising stars in a report that looks at the ability of countries to grasp the opportunities of a rapidly changing global economy.", "Top 15 countries in Change readiness index 1 Chile 2 Tunisia 3 Taiwan 4 Jordan 5 Kazakhstan 6 Morocco 7 Malaysia 8 Uruguay 9 Turkey 10 Peru 11 Botswana 12 Costa Rica 13 China 14 Syria 15 Namibia Source: KPMG"], "title": "Smaller countries 'best geared up for economic change'", "article": "They lack the size of China or India.

The study from consultants KPMG and the Overseas Development Institute thinktank looked at the long-term potential of 60 emerging market countries and found some surprising names in its roll call of those deemed most fit to face the future. After using economic, governance and social measures, the report found to the researchers&apos; surprise that the five BRICS \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2013 were well down the league table. Instead, it tended to be smaller countries that were seen as best geared up to change, seen as the key factor in determining the capacity for sustained, long-term growth. Chile came 30 places ahead of its bigger South American neighbour Brazil, while South Africa, in 26th place, was a long way behind two North African nations \u2013 Tunisia (2nd) and Morocco (6th). China, now the world&apos;s second biggest economy after three decades of rapid growth, could manage only 13th place in the list, while India was 23rd and Russia 51st. The report looked at economic diversification, corruption, entrepreneurship, the relationship between business and government, the health of civil society and the investment climate as some of the indicators. It put Bolivia in last place, just ahead of Mozambique and Zimbabwe. &quot;You only need to look at the impact of recent food, fuel, and financial crises on countries around the world to see the importance of achieving a greater understanding of a country&apos;s change readiness,&quot; said Timothy A A Stiles, KPMG&apos;s Global Head of International Development Assistance Services. &quot;The results of the index are surprising and, when verified, are expected to provide important new insight for policy development and donor action aimed at strengthening government and national capability.&quot; The idea of a Change Readiness Index was first floated at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2011 and over the past few months KPMG and the ODI have been using work by the Economist Intelligence Unit to compile their league table. &quot;Understanding a country&apos;s capacity to handle new and unexpected developments is critical to advancing effective policy,&quot; said ODI director Dr Alison Evans. &quot;This index begins to paint a new picture and is an exciting starting point. We will be enhancing and refining the index over time to make it an even more reliable measure to help predict a country&apos;s economic prospects.&quot; The report admitted that the high ranking of Tunisia, one of the countries involved in last year&apos;s Arab Spring, would spark debate, as would Syria&apos;s position at 14th, only one place behind China. Explaining the high rating of Chile over Brazil and Malaysia over Thailand, it said there were often marked differences between the potential of countries within the same continent. &quot;Chile has made considerable efforts in recent decades to diversify their export structure with noticeable impacts on economic growth. Chile&apos;s competitive position is also supported by high levels of domestic and foreign competition and by an efficient financial market.&quot; It added: &quot;One significant area of difference is in macroeconomic management, with Brazil demonstrating poorer performance with regard to variables such as the inflation rate and government debt.&quot; Comparing the two south-east Asian countries, the report said: &quot;The Malaysian government has been working to improve the business environment, fight crime and corruption and enhance infrastructure and transport. In studying Thailand, analysts identify institutions as one of the most important weaknesses of the country&apos;s economy, with recent political instability further undermining the perceived capability of the country to achieve sustained growth.&quot; The authors of the study said it used evidence from a number of existing indicators with measures identified to capture specific elements of change readiness that were not currently being captured, including risk management capabilities, efforts to promote economic diversification, strong governance and social safety nets.

Nikon D7000, 1/125 sec, f/5.6, 500 mm, iso1000     Question: This Hong Kong mystery bird is interesting for a number of reasons, not the least of which is its genetics. This bird has led some authorities to propose that the biodiversity of southern China and Indochina may have been underestimated. What am I talking about? Can you identify this mystery bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species?  Response: This cute little bird is a grey-cheeked fulvetta, Alcippe morrisonia, a member of Timaliidae, the Old World babblers. Although most timaliids resemble warblers, other members of this family are very diverse in appearance. For this reason, this group is one of several Old World bird families with the highest number of species still being discovered. Within Timaliidae, the genus Alcippe was originally where all &quot;fulvettas&quot; were placed, but new work shows it is comprised of a number of separate lineages that were recently split into 5 independent genera: Alcippe, Schoeniparus, Fulvetta, Pseudominla and Lioparus.  The grey-cheeked fulvetta occurs in broadleaf forest, bamboo, scrub and secondary forests ranging from 200-3050m in elevation. They forage in noisy groups and in mixed species flocks, feeding on insects, seeds and berries. This species is monogamous. Their open cup nest is constructed low in a bush and they lay 2-4 eggs per clutch. Even though this small songbird is resident, my sources tell me this species is reported in Hong Kong only in winter, indicating there is at least some seasonal movement. The grey-cheeked fulvetta has brown upperparts with a grey head and face, a long black crown stripe (missing or not easily visible in some subspecies), a bold white eye-ring and dark red irides, a grey bill, and buffy underparts with pinkish legs and feet. There is slight geographic variation and eight subspecies are recognised, but differences in voice and genetics may result in additional splitting of this taxon in the future. Based on DNA work by Zou et al., published in 2007, some authorities have split and renamed this taxon into three: southeastern (Taiwan) grey-cheeked fulvetta, A. morrisonia; the northern grey-cheeked fulvetta, A. davidi; and the western grey-cheeked fulvetta, A. fratercula -- a change I&apos;ve honoured here.

Obama, speaking at a press conference in Washington on Monday, said he would not address the specifics of the Chen Guangcheng case, but then went on to call for Beijing to address its human rights record.  &quot;We think China will be stronger as it opens up and liberalises its own system,&quot; the president said, in his first comments since Chen fled house arrest to seek US diplomatic protection in Beijing at the end of last week. He added: &quot;We want China to be strong and we want it to be prosperous, and we&apos;re very pleased with all the areas of cooperation that we&apos;ve been able to engage in. But we also believe that that relationship will be that much stronger and China will be that much more prosperous and strong as you see improvements on human rights issues.&quot; A senior US diplomat, Kurt Campbell, flew to China on Sunday before a planned visit to open negotiations with Chinese officials.  Such is the sensitivity of the issue that the US has been refusing to talk publicly about it. America has not so far confirmed Chen is under its protection or that negotiations with the Chinese are under way.  The impasse comes at an awkward juncture in US-China relations, just days before scheduled annual talks on economic and strategic matters between secretary of state Hillary Clinton, Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner and their Chinese counterparts in Beijing on Thursday and Friday. Both Washington and Beijing confirmed the talks will go ahead as planned. The US is looking at options for Chen, ranging from asylum in the US to extracting a guarantee from the Chinese government that neither he nor his family will be harmed.  Chen&apos;s friends say he does not want to leave China and would settle for a guarantee of protection and an investigation into his maltreatment by local government officials over the past six years. China analysts think the chances of Beijing agreeing to the latter is a remote possibility. Zeng Jinyan, an activist and friend, said any move overseas by Chenwould be bittersweet. &quot;I would be absolutely happy for him and his family, but it would reveal that the environment for rights defenders is worsening,&quot; said Zeng. &quot;It would feel desperate if even the most important activist \u2013\u00a0someone who has the wisdom and ability to make changes in China \u2013 had to go into exile to protect his safety.&quot; Chen, a prominent opponent of forced abortion as part of China&apos;s one-child policy, escaped from his village home in Shandong province at the end of last week after 19 months of house arrest.  Obama was asked about the Chen case at a press conference, but refused to be drawn on detail because of the delicate nature of the discussions. &quot;Obviously, I am aware of the press reports but I am not going to make a statement on the issue.&quot; Conscious of criticism by Republicans that he is too soft on China over human rights issues, Obama defended his adminstration&apos;s record. &quot;What I would like to emphasise is that every time we meet with China, the issue of human rights comes up. It is our belief that it is the right thing to do.&quot; He added that it was also the US belief that an improvement in China&apos;s human rights record would make the country stonger and more prosperous. The Chen case presents Obama with a difficult challenge: on the one hand he needs to be seen as a champion of human rights, but on the other, he does not want to endanger US trade and other relations with China. The Republicans regularly characterise him as soft on China, and his Republican presidential opponent, Mitt Romney, on Sunday called on Obama to ensure Chen is protected. The European Union urged China on Monday to &quot;exercise utmost restraint&quot; in Chen&apos;s case and avoid &quot;harassment of his family members or any person associated with him&quot;. Two activists \u2013 Hu Jia and Guo Yushan \u2013 have been released after being put under police detention, but there are concerns for HePeirong, who helped Chen escape, and his cousin, Chen Kegui. The Chinese government is in a strong position economically, holding much of US debt, and is unlikely to agree to anything that might be viewed as a humiliating climbdown, particularly over human rights. Diplomat sources say the two nations will try to keep the issue low-key so that it does not disrupt the US-China meeting later this week.  Relations between the US and China had been improving in recent months, with Beijing being more co-operative with Washington on issues ranging from Iran to North Korea. In spite of this, there are continuing serious strains between the two competing nations over a planned US arms sale to Taiwan and the US strengthening its relations with other countries in the Pacific.  The latter was underscored on Monday by a visit to the White House by the Japanese prime minister Yoshihiko Noda, and meetings between Clinton and US defence secretary Leon Panetta with their counterparts from the Philippines. Mike Green, senior director for Asian affairs in the national security council in the Bush administration and now an associate professor in international relations at Georgetown University, said: &quot;Clinton will not be deterred from pressing China on the Chen issue because of economic interdependence \u2026 The fact that this is an election year in the United States only adds to the importance of standing firm on human rights.&quot; Green added: &quot;On the other hand, with seven of nine politburo standing committee seats up for grabs and a leadership transition to Xi Jinping this year, the Chinese side cannot appear to back down on this case either. The diplomats in the middle, like assistant secretary of state Kurt Campbell and Chinese deputy foreign minister Cui Tankai, are looking for what will be an elusive win-win solution. Those two are talented and may find it.&quot; Phelim Kim, of Human Rights Watch, was less optimistic about the outcome. &quot;If \u2013 as seems to be the case \u2013 Chen Guangcheng is indeed under some form of US government protection, it has all the makings of thediplomatic equivalent of a slow-motion car crash. The lesson of Chen Guangcheng and US-China relations is that when governments don&apos;t purposely weave meaningful and substantive discussions on human rights into the fabric of key bilateral discussion on a regular basis, they risk those issues forcing their way onto the agenda in ways unforeseen.&quot; In 1989, Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi stayed in the US embassy in Beijing for 13 months before leaving for the US."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/30/cutting-red-tape-tax-will-not-revive-britain", "publicationDate": "2012-04-30T21:00:05Z", "tags": ["Tax and spending", "Recession", "George Osborne", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Economics", "Business", "Conservatives", "UK news"], "sentences": ["In terms of per capita manufacturing output, a more accurate indicator of a country&apos;s prowess, Britain ranks only about 20th \u2013 behind even Luxembourg and Iceland, not to mention South Korea and Taiwan."], "title": "Cutting red tape and taxes will not revive Britain | Ha-Joon Chang", "article": "Following the news that Britain has entered the dreaded double-dip recession, those who support the coalition&apos;s austerity policy say that this is just a &quot;technical&quot; recession, as growth is bound to happen in the next quarter. However, even if does \u2013 which is by no means certain \u2013 we are still faced with the grim fact that this current recovery is proving to be the slowest in history \u2013 slower even than the one that followed the 1929 Great Depression. The main reason is, simply put, that Britain&apos;s economic model \u2013 based on an inflated housing market, ever rising consumer debts and freewheeling financial services \u2013 is broken. It is unable to re-generate growth even four years after the financial crash, and is unlikely to do so for at least another couple of years. The bankruptcy of the existing model has prompted talk of &quot;rebalancing&quot; the economy through the revival of the manufacturing sector. Even the chancellor, George Osborne \u2013 not known for his love of industry \u2013 talks of the need for a &quot;march of the makers&quot;. Unfortunately, after three decades of relentless de-industrialisation, Britain&apos;s manufacturing base is hopelessly weakened, and its revival is going to be a long, hard slog. Some people have found solace in the fact \u2013 brought to attention by Peter Mandelson \u2013 that Britain is still the sixth largest manufacturer in the world. But this is essentially on account of Britain having one of the largest populations among the rich countries. In terms of per capita manufacturing output, a more accurate indicator of a country&apos;s prowess, Britain ranks only about 20th \u2013 behind even Luxembourg and Iceland, not to mention South Korea and Taiwan. The weakness of British manufacturing is most clearly illustrated by the inability of the country to generate trade surplus despite the large devaluation of sterling since the 2008 crisis. Compared to the peak in 2007, the pound has lost 15% against the euro, 20% against the US dollar, and a whopping 40% against the Japanese yen. In other countries, devaluation of this magnitude would have generated a massive manufacturing export boom; but in Britain there simply isn&apos;t a big enough manufacturing base that can take advantage. Despite all this, the government&apos;s approach to renewing the sector is to repeat the same old, failed strategy of cutting (personal and corporate) taxes and &quot;red tape&quot;. The theory behind it is that wealthy people and corporations need to be given more incentives to invest and create jobs by making it easier for them to do business (deregulation) and to keep more of the income they generate through their businesses (tax cuts). If only it were that simple. Those who think taxes are hindrances to business do not realise that taxes do not just take but also give resources to the potential investors. With taxes, the government can (and does) provide benefits that all businesses need but are unable to provide individually, except at prohibitive costs \u2013 infrastructure, skilled workers, basic research and development, export marketing (for smaller firms) and so on. The fact that &quot;wealth creators&quot; do not rush to open business in Jamaica, with its 5% top personal income tax rate, or Albania, with a 10% corporate tax rate, shows that the crucial question is how a government spends its taxes, not how much it taxes. Would-be red tape cutters believe that the more regulations there are, the less investment there will be. However, regulation is only a minor factor in investment decisions. Things like growth prospects, technological progress, quality of labour force and infrastructure are far more important. The truth is that, if there is money to be made, businessmen will invest regardless of the level of regulations. This is why the 299 permits that were needed to open a factory in South Korea in the early 1990s did not prevent the country from investing 35% of its income and growing at 10% per year at the time. More importantly, many regulations are there to help business as a whole by restricting what individual firms can do. For example, in the 19th century regulation on child labour may have harmed those firms that used it, but benefited British business as a whole by ultimately making the labour force healthier and more educated. Likewise, regulations on environmental pollution or on excessive bank lending have long-term collective benefits, even if they may hurt individual firms or banks in the short run. Instead of cutting taxes and regulation and hoping for the best, Britain needs a coherent industrial strategy, covering areas such as infrastructural development, support for research and development, skills and training, government procurement, and help for small- and medium-sized enterprises. In the British context, the strategy also has to involve reform of the City of London. Ways have to be found to reduce the short-termism prevalent in the City and enable more investments oriented to the long term, vital for the revival of manufacturing. Pay restraint in the City is also necessary, not simply for the sake of equality but also to prevent the financial sector from depriving the manufacturing sector of talented scientists and engineers. Without completely rebuilding its economic model, the future of the British economy is bleak. The coalition government has to face up to that fact. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2012/may/04/8", "publicationDate": "2012-05-04T19:32:00Z", "tags": ["Zoology", "Science", "Birds", "Wildlife", "Animals"], "sentences": ["Here&apos;s a nice video of a Eurasian wren filmed in Taiwan, singing and eating mealworms:             [video link] Okay, so maybe you prefer to listen to a local bird sing?"], "title": "Mystery bird: Eurasian wren, Troglodytes troglodytes", "article": "    Eurasian wren, Troglodytes troglodytes, Linnaeus, 1758, photographed at Astbury Mere Country Park, Cheshire, UK.

Here&apos;s a reminder of the original mystery bird photograph I showed you:       Question: This British mystery bird may be challenging for some of you to identify from this image, but if you&apos;ve ever seen it, then I think you probably still can identify it. This bird is remarkable for several traits. What are they? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Response: Eurasian wren, Troglodytes troglodytes, is one of the smallest birds in Great Britain, only the goldcrest, Regulus regulus, and firecrest, R. ignicapillus, are smaller. Even though Troglodytidae is a New World family, this particular wren managed to colonise the Old World, where it has successfully set up housekeeping and already has a number of recognisable subspecies.  This species was originally lumped together with the winter wren, T. hiemalis, of eastern North America and the Pacific wren, T. pacificus, of western North America. The Eurasian Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), is a very small insectivorous bird, and the only member of the wren family Troglodytidae found in Eurasia. The wren is mouse-like in its behaviour and it is well known for nesting in all sorts of strange places, such as the pockets of old coats that have been left hanging undisturbed.  The wren is polygynous, where one territory-holding male may have more than one female with an active nest on his territory. A male wren has an astonishingly loud and long song, especially for such a tiny bird. Whenever I&apos;ve heard a singing wren, I&apos;ve found myself gasping for breath after subconsciously holding my breath for the duration of the bird&apos;s song. Here&apos;s a nice video of a Eurasian wren filmed in Taiwan, singing and eating mealworms:             [video link] Okay, so maybe you prefer to listen to a local bird sing? This one was filmed in Cley, Norfolk:            [video link] Can you hear a difference in their songs? In winter or on cold nights, wrens survive by snuggling together into a small hole or crack, sharing body heat until morning, when they go their own way once again.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

But the problem with really getting to grips with this vast and teeming terrain is reliable statistics. Not many organisations, and certainly not isolated bloggers like me, have the manpower to sift properly for patterns in the dozens of box-office breakdowns that trickle out at the start of each year.  Those that do \u2013 research services such as IHS Screen Digest and Rentrak \u2013 aren&apos;t cheap to access. And there are places even they can&apos;t reach easily \u2013 like sub-Saharan Africa, where data is unreliable, if it&apos;s collected at all. Devoted box-office sites such as Box Office Mojo  and The Numbers grapple with these blackouts, too: Box Office Mojo, the most extensive free site, still has no up-to-date charts for China \u2013 only the most talked-about cinema territory at the moment (it&apos;s difficult to find non-Mandarin sources). You can see why it even takes the US establishment several months to put together its worldwide snapshot. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), the lobby group for the major studios, releases its Theatrical Market Statistics report for the outgone year in March. It used to focus solely on the North American domestic market, but now it also takes in the current key growth sector \u2013 international box office \u2013 for Hollywood films. The instalment released six weeks ago showed what, roughly speaking, has been the story of the last decade: zero growth on the US front; a 7% increase (close to the annual norm) in overseas markets, from $21bn to $22.4bn. I&apos;d like to see far more detail on the international side in the report \u2013 the kind of intricate breakdown the US market gets. The MPAA salutes the continuing phenomenal growth in China (up 35% to tie with France as the world&apos;s second largest box-office market outside the US, behind Japan); and we also learn that Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa territory made a small gain (4%) and Latin America a startling jump (24%). But it&apos;s pretty general. The Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa category in particular is a massive and unhelpful conflation, both culturally and economically. If the studios&apos; focus, as Charles Gant suggested in last week&apos;s Film &amp; Music, is now firmly abroad, surely they have more nuanced information available? Here&apos;s a slightly more high-res breakdown of the top growth countries over the last year: 1. Argentina, $172.2m (2010 box office) / $235.4m (2011 box office) / 36.7% (year-on-year rise) 2. Estonia, $10.3m / $14m / 35.4% 3. China, $1,506.7m / $2.026.9m / 34.5% 4. Taiwan, $185.4m / $245.4m / 32.3% 5. Singapore, $119.1m / $150.8m / 26.6% 6. Romania, $35m / $44.2m / 26.4% 7. Chile, $73.4m / $92.3m / 25.8% 8. Malaysia, $161m / $195.2m / 21.2% 9. Columbia, $134.3m / $161.7m / 20.5% 10. Bulgaria, $21.9m / $26.1m / 19.3% Figures: IHS Screen Digest A few observations of my own about 2011. Firstly, the Chinawood gold rush \u2013 which has been picking up media coverage all year \u2013 obscures impressive growth elsewhere around the Asia Pacific area in Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. Dedicated audiences are springing up around the region, and with plenty of well-drilled cinema producers nearby with strong cultural affinities (South Korea; Japan; China, if it can ditch the censorship), the new cinemagoers are not necessarily Hollywood&apos;s for the taking. Secondly, all of the economically fecund Bric countries feature in the list of runners (Brazil and Russia come in 11th and 17th), except for India. I don&apos;t have any 2011 figures, but its box-office and cinema admissions have both been in decline over the last two or three years. Is that a problem with the quality of Indian cinema, which dominates there, leaving a possible in-road for Hollywood (which has been slowly increasing its presence)? Or is there a greater similarity between the US and India than might first appear \u2013 two countries with mature film industries, both hitting saturation point and audience fatigue? Thirdly, several of the nations above also feature on the United States Trade Representative (USTR)&apos;s piracy priority watch list: Chile, China, Russia and the country with 2011&apos;s fastest growing grosses, Argentina. If rampant piracy and crazy growth rates can co-exist, that seems to further undermine the MPAA&apos;s ongoing arguments about the damage done to the industry by downloading and DVD piracy. Time for a rethink? Lastly, if the slowdown in the US domestic cinema market is just what happens in developed countries where market saturation is approaching, Europe bucks that trend. Not only are the fringes (Estonia, Romania, Bulgaria) looking healthy, but the affluent heartland was showing big cine-love as well (Switzerland, Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands feature just off the top 10 \u2013 and France and Germany had good years, too). North America didn&apos;t just post no growth in 2010-11; its box office actually declined (from $10.6bn to $10.2bn). PricewaterhouseCoopers, in its annual Global Entertainment and Media Outlook report, predicted North American box office of $12.2bn in 2011; that would have meant the kind of growth figures that haven&apos;t been seen on the continent for 10 years \u2013 so who knows where they got that one from? Analysing this backslide isn&apos;t straightforward, and as many experts including David Bordwell were quick to point out, 2011 didn&apos;t have Avatar. But in view of the US&apos;s slow box-office growth over the last decade, I wonder if the growing focus on films for the international market isn&apos;t beginning to have consequences at home. Given that the very biggest films \u2013 the poles for the box-office tent \u2013 are becoming less American, are the studios doing enough for their home market? With a string of socially resonant titles in 2011 \u2013 The King&apos;s Speech in the UK, Intouchables in France, Kokow\u00e4\u00e4h in Germany \u2013 you can&apos;t say the same about Europe. Not that you would pick any of these talking points up from the MPAA report \u2013 but then part of the function of this annual clarion call is PRing the American film industry. Maybe it&apos;s safer to keep the message simple. They&apos;ve been bullish since March: their CEO Chris Dodd revealed in a recent speech that domestic box office was up 17% in the first quarter of 2012 over last year. He was also cheerleading the slate of blockbusters that will hopefully go on to lay claim to swelling foreign markets (and The Avengers and Battleship, with the new release patterns Gant points out, are giving him cause for optimism). The MPAA can&apos;t be too bullish, though \u2013 that would lay it open to the charges of cultural imperialism that are quick to arise wherever Hollywood looks too tyrannical. The one stat I would really like to lay my hands on is the percentage of global box office that goes to Hollywood (and it&apos;s not easy to come by \u2013 the MPAA certainly don&apos;t publish it). I&apos;m not the only interested party: I recently received an email from a junior officer at the Chinese Film Bureau asking me that same question. My best stab \u2013 based on the combined takings for the six major studios as a share of worldwide box office in 2010 \u2013 is 67%. That&apos;s a conservative estimate; somehow it&apos;s both more and less than I expected. Thoughts (and more sophisticated calculations) gladly received. \u2022 Thanks to Charlotte Jones at IHS Screen Digest for the table figures."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/may/11/universitas-21-rankings", "publicationDate": "2012-05-11T13:59:00Z", "tags": ["Higher Education Network", "International", "Management and administration", "Excellence", "Higher education", "Education", "World news"], "sentences": ["The four Nordic countries are all in the top seven; four east Asian countries (Hong Kong SAR, Japan, Taiwan and Korea) are clustered together at ranks 18 to 22; Eastern European countries (Ukraine, Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia) are together in the middle range; and the Latin American countries (Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico) also cluster together.", "The countries with the largest proportion of workers with a higher level education are Russia, Canada, Israel, United States, Ukraine, Taiwan and Australia."], "title": "Comparing universities: which country comes top for higher education?", "article": "Higher education is a dynamo for economic growth, powering the supply of high-level skills and the technological advances for improving productivity and opening up new markets. Where HE flourishes, so can an economy. Until now, however, there has been little interest in the comparative strengths and qualities of national education systems around the world. Which countries and governments provide the best environment? More transparency and clarity is needed around this in order to encourage knowledge-sharing, collaboration and development of opportunities for students in all countries. While there are a number of well-regarded global rankings of individual institutions, these don&apos;t shed any light on the broader picture of the system itself, and its state of &apos;health&apos; in terms of encouraging and supporting excellence and international links. It&apos;s important for governments to be able to benchmark how they&apos;re doing. A quality higher education system is one that is well connected internationally facilitates the introduction of new ideas, and fosters trade and other links with foreign countries, through the movement of students and researchers across national frontiers. At the same time, students are increasingly choosing countries to study in as much as individual institutions. This week saw the first publication of a new ranking of national HE systems, based on research at the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research (University of Melbourne) into data from 48 countries with a developed HE offering. The ranking is organised by Universitas 21, a global network of research universities The ranking is based on 20 different measures critical to what makes a &apos;good&apos; HE system, grouped under four umbrella headings: resources (investment by government and private sector), output (research and its impact, as well as the production of an educated workforce which meets labour market needs), connectivity (international networks and collaboration which protects a system against insularity) and environment (government policy and regulation, diversity and participation opportunities). Population size is accounted for in the calculations. For the UK it&apos;s a mixed picture, particularly for a system which continues to attract such a large proportion of international students. Ranked tenth overall, the UK is held down by a ranking of only 27th on resources, including a low rank of 41st for government expenditure. Against that, the UK is ranked only second to the United States on output. The difference in ranking between output and resources is the greatest for all 48 countries and reflects very high productivity. The UK also does well on international connectivity, ranked sixth as it has the fourth largest percentage of international students. It&apos;s ranked 13th on environment, losing points for lack of diversity and being ranked at 19 by the World Economic Forum. While the UK looks to the world stage, many other nations are more interested in what&apos;s happening in their region. The four Nordic countries are all in the top seven; four east Asian countries (Hong Kong SAR, Japan, Taiwan and Korea) are clustered together at ranks 18 to 22; Eastern European countries (Ukraine, Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia) are together in the middle range; and the Latin American countries (Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico) also cluster together. While many countries don&apos;t feel they can be a world leader, they do want to match the standards of their neighbours. Government funding of higher education as a percentage of GDP is highest in Finland, Norway and Denmark, but when private expenditure is added in, funding is highest in the United States, Korea, Canada and Chile. Investment in research and development is highest in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland. The United States dominates the total output of research journal articles, but Sweden is the biggest producer of articles per head of population. The nations whose research has the greatest impact are Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United States, United Kingdom and Denmark. While the US and UK have the world&apos;s top institutions in rankings, the depth of world class higher education institutions per head of population is best in Switzerland, Sweden, Israel and Denmark. The highest participation rates in higher education are in Korea, Finland, Greece, the United States, Canada and Slovenia. The countries with the largest proportion of workers with a higher level education are Russia, Canada, Israel, United States, Ukraine, Taiwan and Australia. Finland, Denmark, Singapore, Norway and Japan have the highest ratio of researchers in the economy. International students form the highest proportions of total student numbers in Australia, Singapore, Austria, United Kingdom and Switzerland. International research collaboration is most prominent in Indonesia, Switzerland, Hong Kong SAR, Denmark, Belgium and Austria. China, India, Japan and the United States rank in the bottom 25% of countries for international research collaboration. In all but eight countries at least 50% of students were female, the lowest being in India and Korea. In only five countries were there at least 50% female staff; the lowest being in Japan and Iran. Competition between individual institutions on regional and international levels is intense and growing as mobility increases and all &apos;markets&apos; become more open. It&apos;s crucial for nations and the appreciation of the global HE system as a whole that attention is not bogged down in rivalries between single &apos;name&apos; players in HE capable of attracting an elite. Whole country systems matter to mass populations of people, improving their lives and contributing to national and international prosperity. The Universitas 21 Ranking should be recognised as an important reference point for governments and everyone involved in HE, to keep focus and attention on how HE can be galvanised for growth.

Which other nation could host the Olympics for a third time, boast of 60 years under one monarch, and showcase such a blend of medieval tradition and modern multiculturalism? That was the plan, anyway. Instead, there have been anger, jeers and slow handclaps as irate travellers inch through a sclerotic passport system at Heathrow. The mayor, ministers, even the prime minister \u2013 terrified of humiliating headlines during the summer&apos;s festivities \u2013 have demanded action over the dismal greeting that two-hour queues present. No doubt they will ensure the passport process is patched up by the time the first starting pistol is fired in July. But what we are seeing is the tip of a nasty iceberg, the most visible sign of a stupid system seemingly designed to deter people from coming to this country. Few of our immigration policies make sense at this time of economic paralysis. Study after study shows migrants are more entrepreneurial, more innovative and more likely to boost prosperity than natives. Yet we turn away students wanting to spend a fortune and business people wanting to build a fortune. Sadly, this will not change in the current political climate. But why do we need to be so unwelcoming to those wanting to come for a business meeting, a shopping trip or sightseeing? Few countries make it easy to obtain a visa. But Britain turns it into torture with a system judged the worst in Europe. It is so bad one in four people abandon plans to visit, costing the country an estimated \u00a3750m each year. There was an Iranian scientist invited to a crucial conference whose passport was held for eight weeks, causing him to miss the event and waste \u00a3800 on flights. The Indian singer, forced to abandon a major concert after his first visa difficulty in two decades of touring. The West Indies cricket tour stripped of players. Or the Turk charged \u00a3545 for his visa. &quot;Should I read a hidden message?&quot; he asked. &quot;Don&apos;t come.&quot; Visitors are told to apply for visas online, whether they have internet access or not. Supporting documents such as bank statements and employers&apos; letters must be translated into English. There are over-long forms and interviews can be hundreds of miles away \u2013 Russia has five centres, all in one corner of the country, while some Middle East and African countries have none, so applicants must go to a neighbouring nation. There are hefty fees (they can be twice the average weekly wage), fingerprinting and, possibly, medical tests. Passports must be handed over for perhaps a month \u2013 a month with no work for business people or performers. And still there is a one in 10 chance of rejection \u2013 and as inspectors have found, mistakes are commonplace and applicants turned down for failing to provide information they were never told they needed. Alice, a 30-year-old Kenyan, was promoted after six years working for a British charity and invited to an induction course. Despite holding a masters degree and living in a large house, she was told she could not be trusted to return since she was not married. &quot;I was very offended,&quot; she said. &quot;The language was rude and it was racist to assume I&apos;m so poor and desperate I&apos;d give up everything to disappear in your country.&quot; Perhaps stupidest of all is how we treat the Chinese. As they become wealthier, they are exploring the world: 78 million going abroad this year, up from 58 million two years ago. Whether on business or pleasure, they spend freely \u2013 typically spending three times as much as the average foreign visitor, such is their love of our designer goods, and nearly eight times more than Britons on a shopping trip to London&apos;s West End. But so slow, so self-defeating, is our visa system that a study found nearly one in three Chinese give up and go elsewhere. Extra staff are being sent to China, but it remains cheaper and easier to go to Europe, since under the Schengen agreement one visa covers 25 countries. Little wonder only 250,000 Chinese come here, compared with 2 million going to France. Australia can complete online visas in just 24 hours. But the bigger question is why we need visas for 108 countries, each negotiated on a bilateral basis. In many cases, we could replace fear with common sense by simply abandoning them. Three years ago we did just this with Taiwan and visitor numbers shot up 40%.

The Greek people will see through this bluff and so should we.Peter RobbinsLondon \u2022\u2008A swift Greek exit from the euro is not the solution \u2013 instead a swift nationalisation of banks in Europe is needed (There is only one way to end this nightmare: Grexit, 16 May). Greece is a symptom and not a cause, certainly not the major cause, of the present nightmare in globalised finance. Greece accounts for less than 2% of EU GDP, and its debt levels are statistical blips in the context of the outstanding assets of the world banking system. A Greek exit does not address the inherent problem in the current architecture of banking, that of amplifying noise in trading in financial services and thus creating massive financial instability. The consequences of such instability cannot be managed in a democratic society. Banks are borrowing at virtually no interest from central banks to lend to governments at a higher interest rate. This public subsidy has not, however, resulted in much new lending by banks to businesses. This is madness. The banking system that crashed four years ago is now beyond repair. The start of a policy of direct lending to governments by central banks and direct lending to industry by nationalised banks would help as a stopgap measure for a couple of years, until these banks can again be privatised, when legislation is in place to let banks operate under credible supervision. A nationalised banking sector is not necessarily incompatible with a successful market economy as the experience of Taiwan and South Korea during their years of double-digit growth demonstrates. The current structure of ownership in Europe is only conducive to prolonging the nightmare that worries us all.SP ChakravartyBangor, Gwynedd \u2022\u2008Surely, the logical conclusion to Simon Jenkins&apos;s article, which was reinforced by the arguments in Austin Mitchell&apos;s letter (Letters, 16 May), is that Germany should be the one to leave the euro, not Greece or the other &quot;southern European economies&quot;. When is someone going to argue that Germany&apos;s current financial strength is not simply a result of its industrial model, but also arises from the competitive advantage it obtains by being in the eurozone. If Germany was to leave the euro and readopt the deutschmark, the deutschmark would go through the roof and the German economy would become less competitive at a stroke, not only against the other members of the euro, but also against most other currencies, including the pound and the dollar. It would appear Mrs Merkel wants to have it both ways, austerity for everyone else, resting on Germany&apos;s export success as a result of a weak euro, not an inherently superior productivity.Fred PickeringHigh Peak, Derbyshire \u2022\u2008Greeks complain they are losing their sovereignty to a German economic &quot;diktat&quot;. It would not be the first such loss of control over the nation&apos;s finances. In 1879, following Greek military adventures and financial mismanagement, an international financial control commission was appointed. This had representatives from Britain, France, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy. It took over the running of Greece&apos;s finances. The commission collected revenues from state monopolies like salt, tobacco, stamps etc, and collected import duties at the port of Piraeus. Would this be worth repeating?Peter FraenkelLondon \u2022\u2008Your reporter (This is not a quarrel in a faraway land, 17 May) speculates on the consequences of a &quot;Grexit&quot;.

Friday&apos;s launch was fun (cue Zuckerberg&apos;s droll status update: &quot;Mark Zuckerberg listed a company on Nasdaq&quot;) but there&apos;s a tendency to see stock market flotations as the culmination of a company&apos;s existence. That&apos;s a common mistake, like first parents being excited about the baby&apos;s birth, and forgetting it&apos;s the next bit that really matters. It has taken eight years to get here, yet it&apos;s easy to forget that this is actually just the beginning. What to expect now? Don&apos;t be surprised if the next big thing is a Facebook phone \u2013 running its own software and developed from top to bottom to involve you in the site all the time. Zuckerberg&apos;s team has been advised to do this directly, because it needs to reach the &quot;next billion&quot; internet users, and they are mainly going to be using mobile phones, not desktop or laptop computers. Selling its own phone would mean it could make itself the background hum of many peoples&apos; lives everywhere \u2013 and show adverts and collect data on its own terms. When Google floated in 2004, everyone knew it was good at search, but they didn&apos;t think it would last. Microsoft was going to come after it, and anyway the founders&apos; lack of respect for the investment banks (something Zuckerberg hasn&apos;t mimicked, hoodies aside) meant the float was not so anticipated. Yet, in the eight years since, Google has bought YouTube and made it the internet&apos;s biggest video destination. It has launched Android, the mobile operating system which now powers more than half the smartphones being sold worldwide. It has won millions of corporate customers for its Google Apps suite. The IPO, at $85 per share, was just the start: on Friday, Google&apos;s shares were $630. Similarly for Facebook, everything so far, and the money and public presence it now has, are just a beginning. It has more users now (901 million) than were using the internet at the end of 2004 (817 million); but the total number of internet users has meanwhile tripled, so rather than having 816 million potential new users, it has 1.38 billion. The potential market has nearly doubled. But can it carry on growing, or will it sputter out, like Myspace and Bebo? Ed Barton, director of digital media at the research firm Strategy Analytics, thinks that getting that next billion will be a significant challenge. &quot;Facebook depends on advertising, and I would highlight that the fastest-growing internet media markets are China and the Far East, India and Brazil,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;Facebook&apos;s potential is nowhere near as strong in those as it has been in the US. And in those markets there are often a number of locally oriented social networks already in place.&quot; China in particular, where Facebook has so far been banned, has many thriving social sites, as does Russia with VKontake claiming about 290 million users (compared to Facebook&apos;s 901 million). Barton doesn&apos;t think there&apos;s any risk of Facebook fading out where it&apos;s strongest, in the west: &quot;In the places where it&apos;s already strong, it has a defensible position,&quot; he said, arguing that we &quot;invest&quot; in the networks we use, and don&apos;t want upheaval. So rather as Google cornered the market for internet search early this century, not by being the first but by being far and away the best, Facebook wasn&apos;t the first social network, but its management has been far better \u2013 and unlike Bebo (bought by AOL) or Myspace (bought by News Corporation) or Friends Reunited (bought by ITV), Facebook had no parent that could feel threatened by its rapid growth. So for some, it looks like a one-way bet. Andrew Schneider, a hedge fund adviser and CEO of San Francisco-based Schneider Family Office, was busy on Friday selling shares of Apple and LinkedIn on Thursday to free up at least $20m of cash for Facebook shares. &quot;You&apos;ve got 900 million users, and you&apos;ve got real solid revenue, and the company is earning money,&quot; Schneider said. But the present limits to growth could be dictated by its heritage. Facebook was founded on a desktop computer in a university dorm room, and while it long since broke free of the latter, it&apos;s the former that prevents it reaching those 1.38 billion, and the next billion to come. That&apos;s because a growing number of internet users aren&apos;t going online through the PC, but through the smartphone. By next year, there will be more internet-capable mobile phones (1.83bn) than PCs (1.78bn), according to research company Gartner. Which is why analysts have been itchy about Facebook&apos;s stark admission that it doesn&apos;t make any money from mobile advertising: it&apos;s missing half the market. What&apos;s the solution? The Facebook mobile app isn&apos;t enough; people only spend a little time there, and showing ads on a mobile screen doesn&apos;t pay well. Horace Dediu, who runs the independent consultancy Asymco, spent a day at Facebook&apos;s headquarters a few months ago and told them to talk to Chinese smartphone manufacturers, create their own version of Google&apos;s Android (as Amazon and China&apos;s Baidu search engine already have) and start selling a &quot;Facebook phone&quot;. &quot;My recommendation was that they should do a handset,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;Because it means they can control the user experience, and capture all the information that they might need to monetise the experience. For Facebook, they could offer it as making your life richer as a social participant.&quot; While there&apos;s no indication of whether Zuckerberg&apos;s teams will act on Dediu&apos;s advice, the rumours that Facebook is working on a phone have surfaced from time to time \u2013 most recently in April, when the Taiwanese news site Digitimes suggested it is working with Taiwan&apos;s HTC to build a device integrating all the Facebook functions, for release this autumn. Digitimes has a mixed record for rumours like these, but it would be a smart strategy. If that seems strange, consider that Google realised it needed to control mobile search or it would lose its dominance; hence Android. But Facebook can create a version of Android that doesn&apos;t rely on Google. (It could use Microsoft&apos;s Bing search engine \u2013 which some executives there offered to sell to Zuckerberg early in 2011; he demurred). Everything is in place for this mewling infant of the internet to turn into a real force, if it chooses. And Zuckerberg certainly will choose to."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/may/22/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2012-05-22T07:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology"], "sentences": ["WoA tablet PCs struggling to hit price targets &gt;&gt; Digitimes  WoA (Windows on ARM) tablet PCs, based on estimated general BOM costs of US$300-350 for 10-inch tablet PCs and US$150-200 for 7-inch models, are struggling to meet vendors&apos; price targets for competition against Apple and Amazon&apos;s tablet PC products because of the additional US$90-100 fee for Windows 8, according to Taiwan-based supply chain makers."], "title": "Boot up: music mapped, Anonymous interviewed, WOA tablets' pricing, and the 'web question'", "article": "A quick burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team The world&apos;s hottest digital markets: a music map &gt;&gt; paidContent Surprising reason why Germany and France buys lots of CDs: because classical music sells well.

China market: Booming sales of Windows Phones could be short-lived, say sources &gt;&gt; Digitimes  According to Michel van der Bel, COO of the Greater China region at Microsoft, sales of Windows Phones have accounted for 7% in China&apos;s smartphone segment recently, compared to a 6% share for Apple&apos;s iPhones.  The strong sales enjoyed by Lumia phones at present are typical short-term results for the newly launched model, and it remains to be seen whether the sales momentum will continue, commented industry sources.  Given that sales of iPhones totaled over five million units in China in the first quarter of 2012, it would be difficult for Windows Phone models to yield the same results in a quarter, the sources commented.

WoA tablet PCs struggling to hit price targets &gt;&gt; Digitimes  WoA (Windows on ARM) tablet PCs, based on estimated general BOM costs of US$300-350 for 10-inch tablet PCs and US$150-200 for 7-inch models, are struggling to meet vendors&apos; price targets for competition against Apple and Amazon&apos;s tablet PC products because of the additional US$90-100 fee for Windows 8, according to Taiwan-based supply chain makers.  The average price of tablet PCs has been dropping rapidly sine the launch of Amazon&apos;s Kindle Fire. But PC brand vendors, who are used to price wars, are nevertheless struggling to compete, because unlike Amazon they do not see additional revenues from post-purchase content sales.   While Digitimes has a shaky reputation, the post-purchase point is an important one. Samsung begins blocking unofficial S-Voice requests &gt;&gt; TheNextWeb  The S-Voice APK, which contained services that were exclusive to the Galaxy S III, allowed owners of other Ice Cream Sandwich-powered smartphones to install Samsung&apos;s new voice assistant (its Siri rival) and perform commands on their devices. It appears that in the last 24 hours, Samsung (and its partner Vlingo, the technology behind the voice functions) have begun detecting requests from non-supported devices and blocking them, displaying the message: &quot;Network Error.

Why Wasn&apos;t I Consulted? The web&apos;s fundamental question &gt;&gt; Paul Ford A really fascinating, thought-provoking essay.   A sitcom works better on TV than in a newspaper, but a 10,000 word investigative piece about a civic issue works better in a newspaper.  When it arrived the web seemed to fill all of those niches at once. The web was surprisingly good at emulating a TV, a newspaper, a book, or a radio. Which meant that people expected it to answer the questions of each medium, and with the promise of advertising revenue as incentive, web developers set out to provide those answers. As a result, people in the newspaper industry saw the web as a newspaper. People in TV saw the web as TV, and people in book publishing saw it as a weird kind of potential book. But the web is not just some kind of magic all-absorbing meta-medium. It&apos;s its own thing. And like other media it has a question that it answers better than any other.   One wrinkle: the web is increasingly being used via mobile. He thinks that&apos;s different from the non-mobile-screen web. Does that change the question? (Thanks @nomster for the link.)

Those requests were answered with bullets, beatings, betrayal, imprisonment and exile. Now, all they are asking for is permission to return home. It&apos;s been almost 23 years since the optimism that gripped China during the seven-week Tiananmen protests was brutally swept away. Now, five exiled Tiananmen leaders have written an open letter calling on Beijing to allow them to return home in the spirit of human rights at a time when &quot;China is undergoing profound changes&quot;. &quot;I want to be able to visit my parents,&quot; said Wang Dan in an email. &quot;The Chinese government not allowing us to return is another continuous punishment.&quot; As the soft-spoken bespectacled student leader with a bullhorn, Wang captured the imagination of the world during that spring of 1989. He also captured the attention of the state security apparatus and was singled out as China&apos;s most wanted man, earning him the first of two prison terms before being exiled to the US in 1998. &quot;China claims it&apos;s a rising power. But a big country should be able to have a dialogue with its own citizens. It&apos;s what we demanded over 20 years ago, and I echo that demand today,&quot; says Wu&apos;er Kaixi, who headed China&apos;s most-wanted list after Wang&apos;s arrest. &quot;If it has to take place in a courtroom, I welcome that too. But I would much rather that this dialogue happens in a dignified and more constructive manner.&quot; Officially, China calls the demonstrations a &quot;counter-revolutionary riot&quot; instigated &quot;by a small clique of bad elements&quot;. There has never been a public inquiry. Internet searches of Tiananmen and 4 June are blocked, and there is virtually nothing in China&apos;s schoolbooks about the incident. &quot;We never wanted to confront or be the enemy of the state in 1989. We wanted to urge the government to have peaceful political reform. They answered us with a military crackdown. They put us in a position to be their enemy, and have been treating us as such ever since,&quot; says Wu&apos;er, who works as an investment fund manager and political commentator in Taipei. &quot;Being jailed is normal for us. Before I made the decision to challenge Communist authority I knew my life would be very hard,&quot; says Wang Juntao via Skype. Wang was speaking just days after a New York memorial service for Fang Lizhi, a fellow Tiananmen exile and one-time pre-eminent Chinese astrophysicist who died in April in Arizona. Wang, a long-time reform activist, was first jailed in 1976 when he was 17. He was later sentenced to 13 years in prison for his role as a &quot;black hand&quot;, or mastermind, of the Tiananmen movement. &quot;That first prison time in 1976, was very, very hard. After Tiananmen the international pressure made it easier in some ways. But I still suffered a lot. I&apos;ve suffered from psychological problems stemming from living in isolation for four and a half years. I think we all have,&quot; says Wang, who was exiled to the US after the Clinton administration struck a deal with Beijing. While a number of dissidents have returned to China, the permission to do so comes attached with stipulations that most dissidents refuse to accept. Xiang Xiaoji, now a lawyer in New York, explains: &quot;I will never apologise for anything. What I did was right, and I will never promise to stop pushing for democracy in China. I will not accept their political conditions to return home,&quot; Xiang says. &quot;Besides, I&apos;m not scared of a jail sentence. I&apos;ve been in exile for 23 years, and I&apos;m 55 now.

Dennis Woodside, a Google employee since 2003, replaces Sanjay Jha, who had built Motorola&apos;s handset business back up from a calamitous position less than five years ago by adopting the Android mobile operating system for its smartphones. Jha \u2013 who forced Google to push up the price it paid for the company by 40% from its original bid last July \u2013 will depart as CEO, along with a number of his senior executives, but will help out to ensure a smooth transition, Google said. Woodside oversaw Google&apos;s acquisition of Motorola Mobility, and is former president of Google&apos;s Americas region. Google says he has &quot;worked with partners, governments and advertisers in more than 30 countries.&quot; Most recently, Woodside was responsible for Google&apos;s sales and operations in the Americas, where the company says his team drove revenue from $10.8bn to $17.5bn in under three years. He formerly worked in Google&apos;s Europe offices. According to Bloomberg BusinessWeek, Apple chief executive Tim Cook tried last year to recruit Woodside to head the company&apos;s sales side \u2013 but Google CEO Larry Page tempted him to stay by offering him the Motorola position. The completion of the acquisition, which finally got the green light from China on Saturday, means that Google has by default entered the hardware business for the first time ever. But Page indicated that MMI will be run separately of the main search engine business so that investors can get a clear idea of its real performance. MMI, spun off from the larger Motorola business in January 2011, has made an operating loss for seven of the past 10 fiscal quarters, and a loss in its mobile phone business for eight of the 10. With 20,500 staff it generates about one-third the revenues of Google with 33,000 \u2013 implying that Woodside&apos;s captaincy will require him to carry out painful job cuts. MMI&apos;s smartphone business has been slow to grow compared to the wider market, despite its early adoption of Android, so that in the first quarter of 2012 it shipped just 5.1m smartphones \u2013 compared to a world market of 144m, giving it just a 3.5% share. Even so, some Android handset makers have indicated concern that MMI will get favourable access to early releases of Google&apos;s software via Android chief Andy Rubin. That concern is thought to be behind the Chinese government&apos;s condition of its approval that Google make Android free and open for the next five years at least. Woodside told BusinessWeek such preferences would not be sought or given. &quot;Andy [Rubin]&apos;s job is to maximise the number of devices running Android,&quot; he said. &quot;My job is to make Motorola as successful as possible and deliver innovative hardware as a licensee of Android.&quot; He said he had three goals: make MMI profitable, use Google&apos;s technical skills to make improvements in areas such as battery life, and get those improvements into MMI devices as quickly as possible. He also suggested that the 20 smartphones MMI released in 2011 was too many \u2013 implying a paring-back there. The Android software already powers more than half the smartphones being sold around the world, but until now Google has kept out of the handset business. But days after losing a high-stakes bid for a group of patents from the bankrupt Nortel to a consortium of Apple, BlackBerry-maker RIM and Microsoft, its mobile chief Andy Rubin and Page turned up at Motorola with a bid. The key reason was patents: MMI owns around 17,000, many relating to mobile, and Page perceived them as essential to protect Android from courtroom attacks from Microsoft and Apple, which were pursuing different strategies against Android handset makers \u2013 Apple suing them to prevent sales of what it saw as products that infringed its patents, and Microsoft suing them to extract a per-handset levy. Microsoft&apos;s strategy has so far been more successful, with HTC, Samsung and others signing payment deals. Apple has managed to delay some shipments of HTC phones into the US, and had limited success in delaying some Samsung phone sales in Europe. But it has lost nearly as many cases as it has won, with little clear benefit. With its patent portfolio, MMI has been locked in battles with both Microsoft and Apple. But because in some of those cases it has asserted some patents that are deemed &quot;standards-essential&quot; and meant to be licensed freely, it is presently under investigation by authorities in both Europe and the US. MMI will also weigh on Google&apos;s financial position. Its losses will effectively drag down Google&apos;s operating profits, though tax allowances from MMi&apos;s spinoff in January 2011 from its former Motorola parent could ease any losses. Google has been signaling recently that it has been drawing up more ambitious plans for MMI. Besides producing smartphones and tablet computers, MMI also has a profitable line making cable TV boxes that could provide Google with a springboard for delivering more of its services, including advertising, to living rooms. However, cable companies control the market for set top boxes, and might not like the intrusion into their realm. Macquarie Securities analyst Benjamin Schachter believes Google is particularly interested in developing a snazzier tablet computer powered by its Android software to compete against Apple&apos;s hot-selling iPad and Amazon&apos;s Kindle Fire. Industry rumours have suggested that Google would release a 7in tablet to compete directly with the Fire within the next couple of months, together with Taiwan&apos;s Asus. In a blogpost announcing the news, Page said that &quot;as a company who made a big, early bet on Android, Motorola has become an incredibly valuable partner to Google.&quot; He added that this was &quot;a great time to be in the mobile business&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/24/society-daily-email", "publicationDate": "2012-05-24T11:41:32Z", "tags": ["Society"], "sentences": ["The blog has been seen by more than a million people worldwide, and children from countries including Japan and Taiwan have shared pictures of their dinners with Martha."], "title": "Society daily 24.05.12", "article": "Sign up to Society daily email briefing Today&apos;s top SocietyGuardian stories \u2022 A third of parents of disabled children took out loans to buy basics last year\u2022 Cable dismisses Beecroft proposals for outsourced public sector workers\u2022 Around 2,400 senior civil servants being paid &apos;off-payroll&apos;\u2022 GPs call for work capability assessment to be scrapped\u2022 Newborn twins&apos; hospital death avoidable, says mother\u2022 UK to resist giving prisoners the vote despite European court ruling\u2022 Rabies case confirmed in UK\u2022 Babies born by caesarean section more likely to become obese, say researchers\u2022 Doortje Braeken: We should teach young people about more than the mechanics of sex\u2022 John Sutherland: Iain Duncan Smith&apos;s plan for &apos;suspected&apos; alcoholics won&apos;t workAll today&apos;s SocietyGuardian stories On the Guardian Professional Networks       \u2022 Metropolitan police goes live with mobile fingerprint scanners\u2022 How can public services make the most of their properties?\u2022 A day in the life of a foster carer\u2022 Doctors have the upper hand in the pension dispute, says Edward Davie\u2022 Marcelle Speller, chief executive of Localgiving.com, explains how online marketing and donation tools can help grassroots organisations survive the current economic difficulties\u2022 David Hall, architect of the reform of council housing finance, identifies the old issues arising from the new funding system On my radar ... \u2022 SocietyGuardian writer Amelia Gentleman, who has won the Orwell prize for journalism, for her &quot;delicate and respectful&quot; reporting on issues including carers, welfare and youth justice.

Thus we have Nick Clegg and Michael Gove and their cohort gnawing at the edge of this problem with genuine concern while enacting policies that take us even further away from the grail of social mobility. Clegg rightly raises the issue of snobbery but, for the Tories, the very mention of class is awkward. Thus Eric Pickles is wheeled out as the guarantor of authentic Tory diversity. The reality, of course, is that class is not loosening but tightening its grip via the education system that is systematically choking off the exit routes for anyone not born to rule.I really don&apos;t need another public schoolboy brandishing his mea culpa. These people can move over and make way for some bright sparks if they mean it.

She compares Office for National Statistics population estimates for local authorities in England for people over retirement age and health deprivation indices for each local authority and concludes:  Age-based funding would give Kensington and Chelsea a boost in funding of around 16% while Richmond and Twickenham could expect an increase of just over 30%.Meanwhile, Tower Hamlets would see its funding cut by 19-20%%, as would Newham and Hackney, while the worst hit areas in England would be Knowsley, Liverpool, Manchester and Stoke-on-Trent, all of which could expect to see anything from a fifth to a quarter of their current funding heading south \u2013 literally.By using age to determine allocation of health funding, Andrew Lansley is not-so-subtly shifting money from poorer, Labour areas to richer Conservative areas, even when there&apos;s no evidence that people in latter areas have higher health needs.  For the Independent, Jeremy Laurance urges another look at the details:  The most deprived parts of England may have the highest rates of death relative to their populations. But that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean they have the greatest need for healthcare. The highest rates of chronic illness are actually to be found in areas with older, more affluent populations \u2013 because it is the elderly who get sick.  \u2022 A curious tale from the Sutton Guardian, which reports that a GP has apologised to care services minister Paul Burstow over his daughter&apos;s comments about the MP on Twitter. Jessica Freeman, the daughter of Dr Howard Freeman, accused Burstow of &quot;slating&quot; her father, who is leading a review of health services in south-west London. A spokesperson for the review told the Sutton Guardian:  The teenage daughter of one of the GPs leading BSBV got carried away on Twitter supporting her father, without him being aware.He has discussed this with her and she is very sorry for any upset or embarrassment she may have inadvertently caused and apologises to Paul Burstow.She has assured her father there will be no recurrence.

Martha Payne, who&apos;s earned the support of Jamie Oliver, started her Never Seconds blog to show photos and vital statistics about her lunch each day. The blog has been seen by more than a million people worldwide, and children from countries including Japan and Taiwan have shared pictures of their dinners with Martha. The Seattle-based Grist site reports that as a result of the blog, Martha&apos;s dad had a meeting with the local council, which has agreed to let pupils have unlimited salad, fruit, and bread.

Like the friend who snapped a Le Creuset making a moussaka, there is always someone who&apos;ll manage to destroy in a day what another will pass down as an heirloom through the generations. Nonetheless, this handmade Swedish bicycle is supposed to last more or less for ever, so I did with it all the sort of things I avoid on my racer. I left it in the rain without fretting about rust. I didn&apos;t panic what a pothole might do to the forks. The paintwork on the last bike I tested scratched the first time I tethered it to a lamp-post with a D-lock; I gave the Pilen far more abuse and the green paint remained\u00a0pristine. It wasn&apos;t a huge change for me. I&apos;m not one of those weirdos who looks after their bike better than their partner \u2013 my bicycle will never sleep in my bedroom. And though some shameful side of me privately enjoys washing my bike of a Saturday afternoon, I generally treat my machines as workhorses rather than ornaments to admire. So the Pilen should have been perfect for me. The expensive steel frame is strong and the Nexus hub keeps the eight well-spaced gears away from the elements. It&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve ridden a bike with front and rear roller brakes tucked away in the wheel hubs, and I was very impressed how effective and low (zero) maintenance they were. The integrated Abus rear-wheel lock meant I only had to lug around one lock to wrap around the front wheel and frame. The dynamo saved me faffing around taking off the lights every time I locked it up and the shiny mudguards protected my clothes from much of April&apos;s showers. And yet, and yet. I never really fell for the Pilen Sport. Perhaps it&apos;s one of those products that only makes true sense in its native setting. Just as that Sarah Lund sweater looks better in Copenhagen than Croydon, the Pilen seems more suited for the civilised streets of M\u00e5lilla, the southern Swedish town where Pilens are made, than for someone like me living in a one-bedroom flat in Hackney. It&apos;s advertised as a light bike but it weighs 18.1kg all in, and I\u00a0dreaded hefting it up two flights of stairs every evening. There was no way I was leaving it outside \u2013 it costs \u00a3995! Here&apos;s how they came up with the price. Posh frame. Fancy super-strong forks with crown brazed legs. A Brooks saddle worth \u00a370. Limited production runs. Much is made on the Pilen website about the bike being lovingly designed and assembled in Sweden, which would explain much of the cost \u2013 until you realise the frames and forks are made in Taiwan and feel a little short-changed.

The FBI reassured the world that thanks to the &quot;swift collaborative action&quot; of law enforcement, it had rounded up five &quot;self-proclaimed anarchists \u2026 intent on using violence to express their ideological views&quot; by attempting to blow up a bridge near Cleveland on May Day. Now, the Cleveland Five look more like bedraggled punks than diabolical geniuses, but surely doom was averted in the nick of time. In fact, the G-Men admit the exact opposite: &quot;At no time during the course of the investigation was the public ever in danger.&quot; So if there was no threat, what really happened? This case was a familiar set-up in which the FBI fishes for dupes it can manipulate with informants and agents who stroke their marks, plant ideas, suggest the plans, provide money, weapons, vehicles and then heroically foil a terrorist act of the FBI&apos;s own design. Since September 11, scores of these entrapment cases have been sprung on Muslims in America. It appears the Occupy Wall Street movement is now worthy of the same treatment. And why not? The FBI&apos;s top priority is counter-terrorism, and it has an $8bn budget to justify, which is close to Taiwan&apos;s annual military expenditures. Springing terrorism traps makes it appear that if not for the FBI, America would descend into Middle East-style mayhem. For informants, there is the lure of cash and leniency for felonies. For agents, it means career advancement. The Cleveland Five \u2013 Brandon Baxter, 20; Anthony Hayne, 35; Joshua Stafford, 23; Connor Stevens, 20; and Douglas Wright, 26 \u2013 were allegedly goaded by a criminal on the FBI dime who said &quot;I could show you&quot; how to take down a bridge, led them to the bridge, told them taking it out &quot;would cost the corporate big wigs a lot of money&quot;, secured inoperable C4 explosives provided by an undercover agent, and then warned them they are &quot;on the hook&quot; for it. The informant also provided them with jobs, money, a place to live, a friendly ear, beer, pot and the prescription stimulant Adderall. Because the bureau announced the arrests on May 1 as Occupy protests were taking place in some 110 US cities, many observers claim they were politically motivated. Then on May 19 and 20 authorities slapped five men with terrorism charges during anti-NATO protests in Chicago. Will Potter, who analyzes FBI entrapment plots in his book Green is the New Red, says the two incidents are &quot;a reflection of an ongoing pattern of behavior from the FBI of singling out political activists and having a direct influence in creating so-called terrorist plots for the purpose of proclaiming a victory in the war on terrorism.&quot; In the Cleveland and Chicago cases, the FBI is so desperate to manufacture terrorists it is now netting children. In Cleveland friends and family describe the boys \u2013 which everyone calls them \u2013 as lost souls who had found hope in the Occupy movement. Lea Tolls, a 46-year-old self-described &quot;Occu-mom,&quot; says: &quot;They are angry. Some have mental illnesses, and there is alcoholism and abuse in their families.&quot; Prior to the arrests, all five except Doug Wright lived at a dilapidated brick warehouse, dubbed &quot;the Fortress,&quot; which Occupy Cleveland had leased as a crash pad. In mid-May I visited the warehouse on a dead-end street and was immediately assaulted by pungent toilets, stale cigarette smoke, soiled dishes, tinny rock music, crude political graffiti and dank youth slumbering in the mid-day heat. It was Anarchist Romper Room. Zachy, a lanky 21-year-old with crudely shorn blonde hair, spilled the beans on the scene. &quot;A lot of us had never lived in a communal situation. This was the first time living away from our parents. Dishes were always a fight. We&apos;re a bunch of uneducated kids.&quot; As a half dozen people hand rolled and smoked cigarettes, I asked them what the Cleveland Five were capable of on their own. The answer was spray painting graffiti. Zachy said last fall &quot;we created a group called the Revolutionary People&apos;s Army. We were being romantic. We were drunk and high. \u2026 Doug, Connor, Brandon, Joshua and Tony were all involved in the RPA. It turned into spray painting Guy Fawkes masks, &apos;Rise Up&apos; and &apos;RPA&apos; and &apos;circle A&apos; anarchist symbols around town. It was silly kid things.&quot; Some were also horsing around with smoke bombs. It was from these childish antics that the FBI claims that Doug Wright dreamed up the initial ludicrous plot \u2013 deploying smoke bombs as cover while blasting off bank signs from the 947-foot-tall Key Bank tower. From there the plot allegedly evolved into using plastic explosives to topple a bridge, all with the help of the FBI informant dispatched to infiltrate the movement. Lea Tolls calls the five &quot;boys playing cowboys and Indians with fireworks and spray paint. They were trying to empower themselves and passionately wanted to change their world. Instead of helping them, the FBI targets them for something nefarious and violent. It&apos;s just disgusting that the government uses them towards this end.&quot; It wouldn&apos;t be the first time. The FBI&apos;s rap sheet is a history of political repression: the Red Scare after the first world war, the anti-Communist purges following the second world war, the disruption of the anti-Vietnam protests, student and black liberation movements in the 1960s, spying on Central American solidarity activists in the 1980s. In addition to targeting Muslims during the last decade the FBI has termed &quot;animal rights and environmental extremists&quot; and anarchists as domestic terrorist threats. It has used infiltrators, most infamously one code-named Anna, to entrap leftist activists. It would be easy to conclude the FBI and the government is out of control. It&apos;s not. It is fully in control. It&apos;s in control of a media that rarely questions the war on terror. It&apos;s in control of a public that willingly sheds rights for the never-ending war. And it&apos;s in control of an apparatus that turns children into terrorists. Arun Gupta is a founding editor of The Indypendent and The OccupiedWall Street Journal.

Days after its $16bn (\u00a310.2bn) roller-coaster share sale, Facebook is preparing to take on Google and Apple by creating its own handset and the software to operate it, according to a string of reports from Silicon Valley to Taiwan. The social network has hired former Apple software and hardware engineers, and one who worked on the iPad, the New York Times reported. Employees and engineers approached by recruiters say the company hopes to release its own smartphone next year. Facebook chief technology officer Bret Taylor is said to be leading the project, and the new recruits will expand a group working with Taiwanese phone manufacturer HTC on a project codenamed Buffy \u2013 a reference to the vampire slayer TV series. News of the Buffy phone first emerged in November. It is expected, like Amazon&apos;s Kindle reader, to run on a customised version of Android, according to Digitimes. Facebook could be looking to stake Google, which dominates the budget end of the smartphone market with its Android software. Google last week won approval for a $12.5bn takeover of Motorola Mobility, which could see the software company designing its own handsets. Zuckerberg is worried that if he does not create a mobile phone soon Facebook will simply become an app on other mobile platforms, a Facebook employee said. Facebook has been assembling the elements needed to create a phone. Besides its alliance with HTC, it is to launch its own app store, where phone versions of Pinterest, Spotify and other websites with links to Facebook will be spotlighted, rated and available for download. Facebook already has a camera app and is about to own another, once its $1bn purchase of the 18-month-old photo sharing site Instagram is complete. It also has an instant messaging service, like Apple&apos;s iMessage and BlackBerry&apos;s BBM. The company was reported on Friday to be in talks to acquire a web browser. Gadget site Pocket-lint said Facebook had set its sights on the Norwegian firm Opera Software, which has developed internet browsers for mobile phones and desktop computers. &quot;They are not doing a phone to enter the devices market,&quot; said Carolina Milanesi at research firm Gartner. &quot;If they do a phone they will have to embed Facebook and Instagram at the core of the device, learning from every click the users does.&quot; Motorola and HTC have already made phones with a Facebook button. The HTC ChaCha, a BlackBerry style handset, lets users share music, photos and updates by pressing the keyboard&apos;s F button. A phone would allow Zuckerberg more control over customers and make for less dependence on Google and Apple. While Microsoft has integrated Facebook features, Apple has been less welcoming. A Facebook spokeswoman referred to a statement on the company&apos;s mobile strategy: &quot;We&apos;re working across the entire mobile industry; with operators, hardware manufacturers, OS providers, and application developers.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/31/new-band-san-zhi", "publicationDate": "2012-05-31T15:55:17Z", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"], "sentences": ["The background: The Sanzhi UFO houses were a series of futuristic pod-shaped buildings in Taiwan designed in the late 70s for visiting US military personnel.", "The truth: They&apos;re Taiwan-derful."], "title": "New band of the day \u2013 No 1,280: San Zhi", "article": "    Hometown: Bournemouth via Egypt.

The background: The Sanzhi UFO houses were a series of futuristic pod-shaped buildings in Taiwan designed in the late 70s for visiting US military personnel. San Zhi, on the other hand, are a pop duo comprising a boy from Bournemouth and a girl from Egypt who have been making music together for a while but have just recruited three musicians to make them a five-piece at least for live performances \u2013 they play their first ever London gig on Friday at Aces &amp; Eights in Tufnell Park, where you may well just about manage to find a spot to stand jostled as you surely will be by all the record company types from all the labels that have apparently been expressing interest in them ever since they posted two tracks online. They&apos;ve been recording in Reims, France, with Guillaume Briere of the Shoes who we wrote about last year under the instructions of guest editor Mike Skinner. And apparently Sam Duckworth of late-00s indie rock troupe Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly is also involved. None of the four tracks we&apos;ve heard by them bears the influence of either the Shoes or Get Cape \u2013 or of modernist architecture, for that matter \u2013 but they are very good, and more importantly, they have commercial potential, and just need the right producer to tease that out. The Ex-Factor, one of the two tracks posted online, ticks some boxes with its woozy keyboards, pretty melody and subtly soulful female vocals from the school of Jessie Ware and AlunaGeorge, and the beat is strong but slow with some of the ghostly leftfield ambience of Polica. The arrangement is full of space and bloops, like chillwave trip-hop, before the rhythm starts to skank like the highly touted Wild Belle, who we raved about earlier this year. A lot of boxes. On Blackholes Suraya&apos;s voice is the cute side of soulful, and the songwriting is interesting. It sounds like a chillified, post-Lana cover version of a rock song that we can&apos;t recall and is keenly aware of contemporary developments while also considering the value of a song that can connect with a wide audience. This doesn&apos;t really fit in either the indie or alternative categories; rather it&apos;s potentially big-league stuff. Ice Light makes us think of a Spector-esque New Order playing a rousing Bruce Springsteen rocker. The verse alludes to &quot;dread&quot; but the chorus \u2013 &quot;get up, get up, get up!&quot; \u2013 couldn&apos;t be more chant-worthy. The keyboard intro to Towards the Sun has a sort of US cop-show theme feel and the song&apos;s lyric asks the usual relationship break-up questions (&quot;If I don&apos;t have you, will I fall?&quot;) but the way it&apos;s framed makes them seem insightful and true. Again, it doesn&apos;t have an indie quality so much as it feels like a demo for something mainstream and big \u2013 with, again, the choice of producer being crucial. Finally, there&apos;s Static Hearts which also bears a guitar sound that you could imagine on a popular mainstream AOR track, with a melody to match. If you&apos;re passing Tufnell Park on Friday night, prepare for a hot&apos;n&apos;squashy close encounter. The buzz: &quot;A lovely, chime-y, softly sung number that sounds like a sweet breeze on a warm day&quot; \u2013 dummymag.com. The truth: They&apos;re Taiwan-derful.

Van Commenee admitted he had asked all the &quot;people that matter&quot; if they know the words to God Save the Queen. &quot;They know the words \u2013 or they will,&quot; van Commenee said. &quot;I know because I asked the question.

The move is designed to avoid unnecessary controversy, of which van Commenee seems to have had his fill. He made it clear how irritated he was by the &quot;issues&quot; he has been distracted with in the run-up to the Olympic Games. &quot;Whether it&apos;s fatty athletes, court of arbitration for sport verdicts, Twitter, or opening ceremonies. I know in Olympic year all sorts of rubbish comes up,&quot; he said. The problems are, he insists, nothing compared to what he dealt with when he was Chef de Mission for the Netherlands at the Beijing Olympic in 2008. &quot;There were lots of issues around Taiwan, Tibet, smog, human rights, not having the ability to express yourself in public, child labour and all these things had to be addressed by me.&quot; &quot;It comes with the job when you have a leading position in sport,&quot; Van Commenee said. &quot;This is nothing compared to what football managers have to go through. At least it tells me that athletics is worth talking about these days. When you are in the spotlight then yes, you get issues to talk about.&quot; The head coach has denied that he was the &quot;high ranking person&quot; who called Jessica Ennis fat and has spoken to her to smooth out any lingering difficulties. His relationship with the former triple jump world champion Phillips Idowu, however, is still poor. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter that I don&apos;t have a relationship with him,&quot; Van Commenee said. &quot;Not at the distance he is jumping.

Every day you worry what to do? What not to do? How to do it? How to change? How to adapt? What can happen tomorrow?&quot; It has been three and a half years since Van Commenee, 53, took on the job of coaching the British athletics team at their home Olympics. He has always been a control freak, but now he is more aware than ever that he cannot afford to let his attention drift for a moment. Van Commenee did just that recently, when he was out cycling in his home country of Holland. He has two cracked ribs to show for it. Typically he is quick to laugh \u2013 he insists he is amused by the spoof Twitter account (@CharlesVComedy) someone has set up in his name \u2013 but at the moment he cannot, because when he does his chest aches. If Van Commenee makes any similar slips this summer, he can expect another bruising at the hands of the British press. The Dutchman is charming in his way, but he has been so outspoken in his time (athletes who complain about injuries risk looking like &quot;pussies and wankers&quot;, Twitter is for &quot;clowns and attention seekers&quot;) that he has no shortage of enemies. His spat with Phillips Idowu is still festering. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter that I don&apos;t have a relationship with him,&quot; Van Commenee says. &quot;Not at the distance he is jumping. It&apos;s not what you would like with athletes but it is what it is.&quot; That sums his philosophy up \u2013 so long as his athletes deliver, nothing else matters much. So long as they deliver. Van Commenee describes himself, somewhat egotistically, as &quot;the public face of athletics&quot;. If his team fail to win the eight medals he has promised the nation, and they will need at least one or two golds among them, then he will take the blame. He has never shirked that fact. And it is worth pointing out that since he took charge the team has met every medal target he has set. But still, he knows some members of the press will be waiting for him to expose a chink so they can slip the knife in. The Daily Mail, for instance, is currently banned from attending all official UKA activities because the British team were so offended by its repeated criticisms of the athletes in the team who were born overseas. After an excruciating press conference in which Michigan-born hurdler Tiffany Porter was grilled over whether or not she knew the words to God Save the Queen, Van Commenee has since checked with all the team&apos;s potential medal winners to make sure they can answer that question. &quot;They know the words. Or they will,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m not going to rehearse everybody because we have 90 athletes but people that matter \u2013 let&apos;s say the relevant ones, the ones on your radar.&quot; He says he doesn&apos;t even know the words to the Dutch anthem himself, but then in the Netherlands they never got their knickers so twisted about whether their athletes could sing or not. &quot;It matters,&quot; says Van Commenee, &quot;because if they don&apos;t [know the words] somebody will make an issue\u00a0of it.&quot; Issues. Van Commenee is getting sick of them. He ticks them off one-by-one: the allegation that a &quot;high-ranking person&quot; in UKA called Jess Ennis &quot;fat&quot;, the campaign against the &apos;plastic Brits&apos;, the court of arbitration for sport&apos;s ruling on the British Olympic Association&apos;s drugs bylaw and the question of Dwain Chambers&apos; eligibility, the coach&apos;s row with Idowu, his refusal to let his athletes attend the opening ceremony. &quot;I know,&quot; says Van Commenee, &quot;that in Olympic year all sorts of rubbish comes up.&quot; Van Commenee insists he put up with worse when he was the chef de mission for the Netherlands at the Beijing Games in 2008. &quot;This is nothing compared to what I had to go through in preparation to Beijing. It was international then. In the lead up there were lots of issues around Taiwan, Tibet, smog, human rights, not having the ability to express yourself in public, child labour, and all these things had to be addressed by me.&quot; He was, he says, a little out of his depth discussing such things. The Netherlands were under pressure to withdraw from the Games, and Van Commenee recalls being surrounded by &quot;a dozen press officers&quot;, all telling him what to say and do. &quot;This,&quot; Van Commenee says, &quot;is nothing compared to these major political issues.

He is, by his own high standards, happy with the state of the team. &quot;I am not carried away because there are one or two months to go, but overall it&apos;s looking positive.&quot; The Aviva Olympic trials on 22 and 23 June, he says, &quot;are going to be more interesting than in the last two decades probably because there&apos;s something to fight for.&quot; He is particularly excited about the breakthroughs made this season by some of the younger athletes. He singles out the pole vaulter Holly Bleasdale, the sprint hurdler Andy Pozzi and the discus-thrower Lawrence Okoye. It is not all positive. He is particularly bothered by the &quot;lack of speed in the sprints&quot; and the injuries in the women&apos;s middle distance group. Still, it almost sounds like Van Commenee is enjoying his work. &quot;I choose to do this job because of the home Olympics,&quot; he says. &quot;I could have easily stayed in Holland in a nice job but I preferred this because it is such a special thing to go through, to experience and be part of. So yes, I am enjoying it. The three years leading up to it have been preparation.

For three days each June, the games world \u2013 from publishers, developers and industry publicists to retailers, we media types and, now, bloggers \u2013 descends on the Los Angeles Convention Centre for a glimpse at what will be released over the next 12 months. Actually, overwhelming doesn&apos;t really do it justice. The show is spread over two massive halls at the convention centre \u2013 West and South. And the two halls are a five-minute walk apart, which means that visitors get plenty of exercise. The West hall is dominated by the big three \u2013 Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony. Nintendo, of course, is showing off the new Wii U console, which should be in stores before Christmas (the company is yet to reveal the release date). The Wii U games look terrific \u2013 particularly Nintendo Land, New Super Mario Bros U, Lego City: Undercover and ZombiU. Disappointingly, Nintendo would not be drawn on the specs of the new unit, so we don&apos;t know yet just how powerful it is, or even what media the games will come on (it does have a disc slot, so my guess is Blu-ray). The South hall houses many of the third-party publishers and developers \u2013 Disney Interactive, EA, Ubisoft, Activision, Bethesda and others \u2013 along with smaller indie developers and peripheral manufacturers. Both halls are a sea of people standing or sitting in front of screens with a controller in their hands. The South hall, though, feels more like a nightclub than an exhibition space, a cacophony of light and sound. It&apos;s where trailers for all the bigger, louder games \u2013 such as Crisis 3 from EA, Assassin&apos;s Creed 3 from Ubisoft, Devil May Cry from Capcom and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 from Activision \u2013 can be seen on massive screens above the booths. Of course, the hardest thing to do at E3 is play games. Many of the bigger titles \u2013 such as Halo 4, God of War, The Amazing Spider-Man and Beyond \u2013 have long queues of eager gamers lining up for a quick play. The biggest surprise of the show is the booth babes, surely an unnecessary anachronism in 2012? A booth babe row sprung up this week over a tweet from Asus at the Computex technology show in Taiwan. No such silliness here at E3, but surely most people would agree that everyone attending the show is here for one reason and one reason only: the games. And driving home just how out-of-place these booth babes are is the fact that as you look around, you notice that almost half the people attending E3 are women \u2013 media, industry PRs and yes, even game developers. So here&apos;s a thought for next year, E3 \u2013 for the sake of balance, how about some booth boys too?     Booth boys?

Cycling in central Edinburgh can be a challenge for the most experienced rider. For cycle couriers it can be akin to a daily assault course. Next week, the city&apos;s bike messengers will pit themselves against the best in the world as Edinburgh hosts the European Cycle Messenger Championships. It&apos;s the 17th year of the competition but the first to open its doors to any cyclist who thinks they can match the pace and panache of the couriers: trousers rolled up, radio holsters strapped on, D-lock in the back pocket. &quot;Over the years, couriers have been this kind of subculture, kind of us and them, so this year we&apos;re really trying to involve everybody,&quot; says Eva Ballin, 41, a veteran Edinburgh bike messenger and organiser of this year&apos;s event. &quot;This year we want to have it open to anyone with a bicycle. We think Edinburgh is a beautiful, and challenging, city to cycle in.&quot; More than 100 couriers from across Europe and as far afield as Canada, Japan and Taiwan will be in the city between 15 and 17 June to take part in a series of events. It starts off with a one-mile sprint up Arthur&apos;s Seat. Organisers had originally envisaged a race around the city landmark, but with a live traffic downhill section and three roundabouts, it was deemed by police to be too dangerous. There is also a five-hour track event at the Meadowbank velodrome, and the final challenge when participants will have to pick up and deliver a series of parcels and packages around the city. And it&apos;s not necessarily the fastest that will come first. &quot;It&apos;s a package race, courier-style, but it&apos;s not just about being fast,&quot; says Ballin. &quot;You have to be smart and you have to be polite. If you jostle, you&apos;re going to the back of the queue.&quot; But surely the Edinburgh messengers will have a head start when it comes to cobbles and inclines. &quot;Maybe over those who don&apos;t have any hills,&quot; says Ballin, who admits her least favoured route is a straight and unrelenting run from the bottom of Dundas Street to the top of the Mound. Some days, she can be up and down it like a yoyo. &quot;Just as you&apos;re getting tired you get another call. And with the roadworks in the city centre it&apos;s a drag. Sometimes you feel you might be better walking than cycling.&quot; Brian Dunsmore, a former courier and now a partner in a Glasgow cycle shop, said it was apt that the competition was in Scotland this year because it&apos;s the 200th anniversary of the birth of Kirkpatrick MacMillan, the founding father of the bicycle. &quot;The competition will celebrate the bicycle as a working tool, a simple means of transport, a health and fitness booster and ultimately a little piece of freedom in an increasingly congested urban environment,&quot; he said. The event has the backing of Edinburgh city council, and on Tuesday some of the contestants met the lord provost, Donald Wilson, at the city chambers."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/15/diamond-street-rachel-lichtenstein-review", "publicationDate": "2012-06-15T21:55:12Z", "tags": ["History", "Books", "Culture", "London", "UK news"], "sentences": ["Shadows fall over Diamond Street too: the apprenticeship system that guaranteed high standards is on the wane, little polishing and manufacturing is carried out any longer in London, competition from companies in Singapore and Taiwan is\u00a0rising."], "title": "Diamond Street by Rachel Lichtenstein \u2013 review", "article": "Put prosaically, Hatton Garden is a street in central London. For more than a century though it&apos;s been known, at home and abroad, for its jewellery dealers and for being the centre of the British diamond trade. A magnet for Jews escaping pogroms across Europe and poverty in the capital&apos;s East End, remembered by old-timers as a tightly knit place where Yiddish was widely spoken, it was once\u00a0likened by a journalist to &quot;Little Jerusalem in England&apos;s green and pleasant land&quot;. The nexus of money and migration tends to breed rumours and myths. Hatton Garden, though never as demonised as Stepney or Whitechapel, often figures as a kind of upscale version of Sax Rohmer&apos;s Chinese Limehouse, one that&apos;s populated by clannish kinsfolk, mysterious brokers, ambiguous characters who look pauperish but may be loaded. Stories abound, as seductive as they are mostly unsubstantiated, of the street&apos;s underground network of secret chambers and corridors. Such fabulations and occult fantasias are manna for writers about London. For the oral historian Rachel Lichtenstein, one of the few prominent female figures operating within the fuzzily defined field of contemporary psychogeography, Hatton Garden is where her grandfather and her parents worked. As a student she helped out at\u00a0the family store, writing out price labels for jewellery and dropping off supplies for Orthodox and Hasidic diamond dealers. Lichtenstein&apos;s previous book, On Brick Lane (2007), was a contribution to the popular field of disappearing London studies. It evoked lives and communities rendered fragile by real-estate developers, City encroachment, and the neighbourhood&apos;s discovery by &quot;creatives&quot;. Shadows fall over Diamond Street too: the apprenticeship system that guaranteed high standards is on the wane, little polishing and manufacturing is carried out any longer in London, competition from companies in Singapore and Taiwan is\u00a0rising. Lichtenstein trained as a sculptor and takes relish in chronicling the craftsmanship of generations of polishers, setters and cutters. Forges, lathes, wooden pegs, turning machines, metal moulds: a poetry of production emerges from the long inventories of tools and equipment they wielded. In damp, sometimes ratty workshops, they handled gold, sapphire and precious gemstones, the calloused hands they ended up with contrasting with the smooth fingers and necks of the Russian tsarinas and Middle Eastern princesses for whose adornment their work is often bought. These craftsmen perform a hallowed form of manual labour whose tactility is to be savoured at least as much as it is bemoaned. One goldsmith announces: &quot;We will be the last people to handle many of the objects produced here with bare hands. They go into collections where they will be picked up with white gloves and spoken over in whispered tones before being carefully put back into a glass case.&quot; This goldsmith and his colleagues were responsible for Siren, Marc Quinn&apos;s life-sized 2008 sculpture of Kate Moss, thought to be the largest man-made gold statue since Egyptian times. But his expertise and his pride in his work aren&apos;t unusual; many of Lichtenstein&apos;s interviewees, though earning meagre salaries, carried on well after their retirement ages. Their collective eloquence about their graft and guile makes Diamond Street a timely companion volume to Richard Sennett&apos;s The Craftsman (2008) and Matthew Crawford&apos;s Shop Class As Soulcraft (2009). Streets are not islands. They get their meaning from the lanes and avenues around them. Hatton Garden is in a neighbourhood that used to be heavily populated by Italians. In the 19th century they worked as organ grinders, ice-cream sellers, glass blowers, magnifying-glass manufacturers. They often did business outdoors, creating public theatre out of their retailing nous, drifting away after German bombing and British internment during the second world war. In the company of Iain Sinclair, her co-author on Rodinsky&apos;s Room (1999), Lichtenstein tramps through the avenues and back lanes of nearby Clerkenwell and Farringdon, hearing stories of long-gone antiquarian booksellers who dealt with excessively grasping customers by ripping the titles they craved before their eyes. What she finds in the Hatton Garden workshops \u2013 filings and dust, scraps and broken pieces of precious metal \u2013 also describes the fragmented narratives that, allied with diligent archival trawls, she assembles into this fascinating and much-needed account. The longer Diamond Street goes on, the greater the tension between Lichtenstein&apos;s preferred mode of writing \u2013 polite, research recounted in the tone of extended journal entry \u2013 and more experimental approaches that include getting American artist Mary Flanagan to use Google Street View to conduct a hybrid of digital flanerie and cyber s\u00e9ance on Hatton Garden. Later she goes down into the sewers of the Fleet, the second largest river in Roman times, to divine the area&apos;s subterranean essence. There, in the echolalia of underground, she discovers that she had &quot;only just begun to scratch the surface&quot; of her subject. Perhaps that \u2013 when it comes to writing about London, or any place really \u2013 is all one can hope for."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/18/china-birth-of-superpower", "publicationDate": "2012-06-18T19:30:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Ai Weiwei", "Art and design", "Environment", "Pollution", "Censorship", "Hu Jintao", "Journalist safety", "Media"], "sentences": ["Looking back over the stories that followed, it is hard to believe so much could be compressed into such a short span of time \u2013 the outbreaks of Sars and bird flu, the attempted assassination of the president of Taiwan, deadly unrest in Tibet, the devastating earthquake in Sichuan, murderous ethnic violence in Xinjiang, Tibetan self-immolations, as well as the huge regional stories: two tsunamis \u2013 in 2004 in the Indian Ocean and last year in the Pacific, a multiple nuclear meltdown in Fukushima, and the protracted rattling of nuclear sabres on the Korean peninsula.", "But at various times, I have been called a communist sympathiser, supporter of Taiwan, a stooge of the Dalai Lama."], "title": "China: witnessing the birth of a superpower", "article": "When I moved to Beijing in August 2003, I believed I had the best job in the world: working for my favourite newspaper in the biggest nation at arguably the most dramatic phase of transformation in its history. In the past decade, it has given me a front-row seat to watch 200-odd years of industrial development playing at fast forward on a continent-wide screen with a cast of more than a billion. That said, I am glad my daughters were young and easy to please back then or we might well have taken the first plane out of the country. As we drove from the airport to our apartment, I tried to maintain an upbeat chatter. &quot;Look at all the kites,&quot; I said as we passed Chaoyang park, even though my heart sank at the tatty buildings, endless construction sites and stultifying haze. In my head, I asked myself: &quot;Have I done the right thing for them?&quot; We had come from Japan \u2013 a democratic, comfortable, polite, hygiene-obsessed, orderly, first-world nation \u2013 to the grim-looking capital of a developing, nominally communist country that looked and sounded like a giant building site. For all my enthusiasm, my family must have felt we were taking a step backwards in lifestyle. It required an adjustment of preconceptions. Like many newcomers, I delighted at discoveries of Chinese literature and Daoist philosophy, Beijing parks, the edgy eccentricity of Dashanzi and the glorious mix of classicism and obscenity in the Chinese language, though I never managed to master it. The mix of communist politics and capitalist economics appeared to have created a system designed to exploit people and the environment like never before. It was so unequal that Japan appeared far more socialist by comparison. And it was changing fast. As swaths of the capital were being demolished and rebuilt for the Olympics, there was an exhilarating (and sometimes disorientating) sense of mutability. Everything seemed possible. Looking back over the stories that followed, it is hard to believe so much could be compressed into such a short span of time \u2013 the outbreaks of Sars and bird flu, the attempted assassination of the president of Taiwan, deadly unrest in Tibet, the devastating earthquake in Sichuan, murderous ethnic violence in Xinjiang, Tibetan self-immolations, as well as the huge regional stories: two tsunamis \u2013 in 2004 in the Indian Ocean and last year in the Pacific, a multiple nuclear meltdown in Fukushima, and the protracted rattling of nuclear sabres on the Korean peninsula. One of my first tasks in 2003 was to chose a Chinese name. I opted for &quot;Hua Zhong&quot;, partly because it sounds a little like &quot;Watts, Jon&quot;, but mainly because the characters mean &quot;Sincere to China&quot; \u2013 something I was determined to be as a reporter. Nine years later, that sentiment has not faded. But at various times, I have been called a communist sympathiser, supporter of Taiwan, a stooge of the Dalai Lama. However, my focus has been on development and its impact on individuals and the environment. In 2003, China had the world&apos;s sixth-biggest GDP. It passed France in 2004, Britain in 2006, Germany in 2009, and Japan in 2011. On current course, it will replace the US as No 1 within the next 15 years. It is already top in terms of internet population, energy consumption and the size of its car market. A decade of dominance The primary driver for change has been the movement of people. Over the past nine years 120 million Chinese people \u2013 almost twice the population of the UK \u2013 have moved from the countryside to the city. This mind-boggling shift has its problems, as I found in Chongqing, but for the most part, China appears to have avoided the worst of the poverty, crime and ghettoes seen in other rapidly urbanising countries. Yet it also seems more brittle, perhaps because of the other big economic engine: infrastructure investment. In this period, China has been re-wired and re-plumbed. There has been an extraordinary expansion of power, transport and communication networks that have linked the nation like never before: west-east gas pipelines, south-north water diversion, hundreds of airports and a massive new electricity grid linking wind and solar power plants in the deserts to power-hungry consumers in cities and industrial plants. This has been a decade of cement and steel, a time when economic development has pushed into the most remote corners of China with a series of prestige projects: the world&apos;s highest railway, the biggest dam, the longest bridge, putting a man into space, the most ambitious hydroengineering project in human history and, of course, hosting \u2013 and dominating \u2013 the Olympics for the first time. It has been a privilege to watch this redistribution of wealth and power from the developed to the developing world. On a global level, such a shift will require nothing less than a grand accommodation \u2013 or a violent conflict. Beijing appears to be preparing for both. Other news during this period showed a hardening of China&apos;s military muscle: a breakthrough satellite-killing missile test, the launch of a first aircraft carrier, the development of a new stealth fighter and a steady increase in military spending. Criticism has rarely been appreciated. All too often, there have been flare-ups of anti-foreign media hostility. Some of my colleagues in other media organisations have received death threats. I never expected China to be an easy place to work as a journalist. For political and cultural reasons, there is a huge difference in expectations of the media. For historical and geo-strategic reasons, there is a lingering distrust of foreign reporters. Run-ins with the police, local authorities or thugs are depressingly common. I have been detained five times, turned back six times at roadblocks (including during several efforts to visit Tibetan areas) and physically manhandled on a couple of occasions. Members of state security have sometimes followed interviewees and invited my assistants &quot;out for tea&quot;, to question them on who I was meeting and where I planned to visit. Censors have shut down a partner website that translated Guardian articles into Mandarin. Police have twice seized my journalist credentials, most recently on this year&apos;s World Press Freedom Day after I tried to interview the blind human-rights activist Chen Guangcheng in hospital. When that happened, I debated with another British newspaper reporter who was in the same position about whether to report on the confiscation. He argued that it was against his principles for journalists to become part of the story. I used to believe the same, but after nine years in China, I have seen how coverage is influenced by a lack of access, intimidation of sources and official harassment. I now believe reporters are doing a disservice to their readers if they fail to reveal these limitations on their ability to gather information. Yes, there is often negative coverage and yes, many of the positive developments in China are underemphasised. But I don&apos;t think it does the country&apos;s international image any favours to clumsily choke access to what is happening on the ground. Treated like a spy, I have sometimes had to behave like one. At various times, I&apos;ve concealed myself under blankets in a car, hidden in a toilet, waited until dark in a safe house and met sources in the middle of the night to avoid detection. At other times, it is Chinese journalists and officials who pull the screen of secrecy aside. Take the foot-and-mouth outbreak on the outskirts of Beijing in 2005. I was first alerted to this by a Chinese reporter, who was frustrated that the propaganda department had ordered the domestic media not to run the story. Foreign ministry officials often tell me China is becoming more open and, indeed, there have been steps in that direction. But restrictions create fertile ground for rumour-mongering. One of the biggest changes in this period has been the spread of ideas through mobile phones and social networks. The 513 million netizens in China (up from 68 million in 2003) have incomparably greater access to information than any previous generation and huge numbers now speak out in ways that might have got them threatened or detained in 2003. Microblogs are perhaps nowhere more influential than in China because there is so little trust of the communist-controlled official media. It has been fun watching netizens create an ingenious new language to evade restrictions. In this anti-authoritarian world, the heroes are the &quot;grass mud horses&quot; (which, in Chinese, sounds the same as a core banned phrase: &quot;Fuck your mother!&quot;) while the villains are the river crabs (which is pronounced like &quot;harmony&quot; \u2013 the favourite excuse of the authorities when they crack down on dissent). But ultimately, a journalist wants to see things for him or herself. I will never forget the epic road trips \u2013 across the Tibetan plateau, along the silk road, through the Three Gorges and most memorably from Shangri-la to Xanadu. Along the way, I met remarkable people with extraordinary stories. True to the oft-heard criticism of the foreign media, many were from the &quot;dark side&quot;: a young man in Shaoguan who confessed \u2013 as the shadows lengthened on the building site where we had our interview \u2013 to killing Uighur co-workers at his toy factory because of a rumour they had raped Han women; a gynaecologist in Yunnan who argued with great conviction that it had once been necessary to tie pregnant women up to carry out abortions; the young boy who found the body of his dead grandmother who killed herself a year after his father \u2013 an illegal migrant \u2013 phoned her to say he was about to drown in what became known as the Morecambe Bay disaster. Other stories literally turned up on my doorstep \u2013 such as the petitioner who arrived at my office a few weeks before I left. We had never met, but it was easy to identify Yang Zhong, who stood out a mile with his country boots, green overalls and bags crammed full of injustice. The look was all too familiar. I have lost count of the number of petitioners who have asked the Guardian to investigate land thefts, corruption cases, industrial accidents, rapes, murders and other alleged abuses of power. Yang had come from Jinshantun village in the far northern province of Heilongjiang to accuse a local forestry chief \u2013 Wang Liguan \u2013 of illegal logging in one of China&apos;s last great protected forests and for having him locked up and beaten when he dared to complain. Typically, his story, minutely recorded in reams of papers and even on a DVD, was anything but black and white. Weak laws and strong censorship make it difficult for such people to have their cases heard in the domestic system so they turn to foreign news bureaus. There were so many grim accounts it was impossible to give them all the time and attention they deserved. Heroism and brutality But there were also stories of success, heroism and inspiration as a nation embraced new wealth and battled for new ideas: the business empires built by enlightened philanthropists such as Yin Mingshan of Lifan auto, the internet fortunes accrued by entrepreneurs such as Jack Ma of Alibaba and Robin Li of Baidu. Compared with nine years ago, people in China have more freedom to shop, to travel and to express their views on the internet. The Communist party tolerates a degree of criticism,but step over the invisible line of what is acceptable and the consequences are brutal. In my first years in China, I interviewed several outspoken opponents \u2013 Liu Xiaobo, Gao Zhisheng, Hu Jia and Teng Biao. I was impressed back then that they were at liberty to speak out. It seemed like the act of a confident government. But all of them have subsequently been locked up and, in at least two cases, tortured. The blame for that surely lies with the authorities. But I have sometimes felt pangs of guilt. I first interviewed Ai Weiwei in the summer of 2007 for an Olympic preview. He was one of the creators of the &quot;bird&apos;s nest&quot; stadium and I was expecting him to tell me how proud he would be when it was unveiled at the opening ceremony. Instead, he told me he would not attend in protest at the &quot;disgusting&quot; political conditions in the one-party state and then launched into a withering assault on propaganda. It was the first time he had expressed such views to the foreign media \u2013 a great scoop, but also one fraught with risk. At the end of the interview, I cautioned the artist: &quot;Are you sure you want to say this? It could get you into a great deal of trouble with the authorities.&quot; &quot;Absolutely,&quot; he replied. &quot;I only wish I could say it more clearly.&quot; Despite that confirmation and the similarly critical comments he subsequently made to other media organisations, I felt partly responsible when Ai was detained last year. Whether the repression is getting better or worse has been a constant question with few clear answers. My feeling is that China has become a less tolerant country since 2008. That was a coming of age of sorts, when China stopped seeming like a work in progress and started looking and behaving like a superpower. On the Beijing skyline, the scaffolding and cranes had been replaced by stunning architectural wonders. The ever-present sentiments of victim-hood and nationalism found powerful outlets in the Tibetan uprising, torch relay protests and the Sichuan earthquake. Meanwhile, those who had supported moves towards a more open, liberal, internationalist China saw the value of their political stock plunge almost as fast as the Dow Jones index in the global financial crisis. With the western model apparently shattered, many in China understandably felt less inclined than ever to listen to outside advice. In the four years since, China has become a more modern and connected nation, but \u2013 despite the official hubris \u2013 it also seems more anxious that the uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa may spread. The government now spends more on internal security than defence of its borders \u2013 a sign that it is more frightened of its own people than any external threat. Little wonder. This has been an era of protest in China. The government stopped releasing figures a few years ago, but academics with access to internal documents say there are tens of thousands of demonstrations each year. The reasons are manifold \u2013 land grabs, ethnic unrest, factory layoffs, corruption cases and territorial disputes. But I have come to believe the fundamental cause is ecological stress: foul air, filthy water, growing pressure on the soil and an ever more desperate quest for resources that is pushing development into remote mountains, deserts and forests that were a last hold-out for bio and ethnic diversity. This is not primarily China&apos;s fault. It is a historical, global trend. China is merely roaring along the same unsustainable path set by the developed world, but on a bigger scale, a faster speed and at a period in human history when there is much less ecological room for manoeuvre. The wealthy portion of the world has been exporting environmental stress for centuries. Outsourcing energy-intensive industries and resource extraction have put many problems out of sight and out of mind for western consumers. But they cannot be ignored in China. The worst problems are found in the countryside: &quot;cancer villages&quot;, toxic spills, pitched battles to block a toxic chemical factory, health hazards from air pollution and water and the rapid depletion of aquifers under the north China plain \u2013 the country&apos;s bread-basket. The implications are global. China has become the biggest greenhouse-gas emitter on the planet. This year, it will probably account for half the coal burned in the world. The number of cars on China&apos;s roads has increased fourfold since 2003, driving up demand for oil. Meanwhile, there is less and less space and respect for other species. For me, the most profound story of this period was the demise of the baiji \u2013 a Yangtze river dolphin that had been on earth for 20m years but was declared extinct in 2006 as a result of river traffic, pollution, reckless fishing and massive damming. I switched my focus to environment reporting. It was not just the charismatic megafauna and the smog, though the concern about air quality never went away. It is really not funny to send your children off to school on days of high pollution with a cheery &quot;Try not to breathe too much&quot;, knowing they will probably be kept in at break-times because the air outside is hazardous. As I have noted at greater length elsewhere, I had come to fear that China may be where the 200-odd-year-old carbon-fuelled capital-driven model of economic development runs into an ecological wall. Britain, where it started, and China may be bookends on a period of global expansion that has never been seen before and may never be repeated again. Developed nations have been outsourcing their environmental stress to other countries and future generations for more than two centuries. China is trying to do the same as it looks overseas for food, fuel and minerals to satisfy the rising demand of its cities and factories. This has been extremely good news for economies in Africa, Mongolia, Australia and South AmericaI sympathise with China. It is doing what imperial, dominant powers have done for more than two centuries, but it is harder for China because the planet is running short of land and time. With their engineering backgrounds, President Hu Jintao (a trained hydro-engineer) and premier Wen Jiabao (one of China&apos;s leading experts on rare earth minerals) are probably better aware than most global leaders about the challenge this poses. While there has been almost no political reform during their terms of office, there have been several ambitious steps forward in terms of environmental policy: anti-desertification campaigns; tree planting; an environmental transparency law; adoption of carbon targets; eco-services compensation; eco accounting; caps on water; lower economic growth targets; the 12th Five-Year Plan; debate and increased monitoring of PM2.5 [fine particulate matter] and huge investments in eco-cities, &quot;clean car&quot; manufacturing, public transport, energy-saving devices and renewable technology. The far western deserts of China have been filled with wind farms and solar panels. That is the most hopeful story of this grey era. If China could emerge from the smog with a low-carbon economy, it would be a boon for the world. But talk of the world&apos;s first green superpower remains as premature as the image of the &quot;red menace&quot; is outdated. When my predecessor, John Gittings, left China after 25 years, he presciently foresaw how the the old cold war stereotypes would be shattered by the country&apos;s speed of development. But that is just the start of realignment. In the future, I believe the most important political division will not be between left and right, but between conservers and consumers. The old battle of &quot;equality versus competition&quot; in the allocation of the resource pie will become secondary to maintaining the pie itself. But the transition has some way to go. In the next 10 years, China is likely to build more dams than the US managed in its entire history and, despite the Fukushima disaster, it plans to construct more about 20 new nuclear power stations. But even with this huge expansion of non-fossil-fuel-based energy, if the economy continues to grow at its current pace China will require about 50% more coal than it currently burns.I expect there will be a slowdown before then as overseas markets contract and domestic investment suffers from the law of diminishing returns. Long-hidden environmental costs \u2013 over-depletion of key resources and under-regulation of waste \u2013 will force their way onto corporate balance books and national budgets in the form of turbulent commodity prices and higher clean-up expenses. China may well look back on the Hu and Wen era as a golden age of growth and perhaps a missed opportunity to put in place the reforms needs to adjust to leaner times. Respect, sympathy \u2013 and pessimism Meanwhile a new leadership \u2013 almost certainly to be headed by Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang \u2013 will take the helm at this autumn&apos;s party congress. They will have their work cut out. While the Hu-Wen era was one of construction, Xi and Li will have to put more effort into maintenance. This will require more than the creation of wealth and construction jobs; it will require a system with greater flexibility, efficiency and a new set of values. I expect that transition will be more turbulent than anything seen in the past 10 years. But success or failure, I believe it will remain the most important story in the world. So why am I leaving? Well, over the years, I have come to feel increasing respect, sympathy and affection for China, but also more pessimism. Journalists here are worn down like brake pads on a speeding juggernaut. Such cynicism is not healthy. I hope a change of scene will allow me to see China \u2013 and the world \u2013 afresh. Regardless of Beijing&apos;s choking smog, traffic and politics, it will be hard to match living and working in China. I shall miss hikes along wild stretches of the Great Wall, swimming under remote waterfalls, wandering through vibrant hutongs, incredible food and some of the smartest company I have encountered anywhere in the world. In the past few weeks, I have said goodbyes to places, friends, long-suffering assistants and sources, some of whom have become global names as their country has risen in prominence over the past nine years: the environmentalist Ma Jun (winner of this year&apos;s Goldman Prize), the lawyer Teng Biao, journalist Li Datong, the rights activists Hu Jia (winner of the Sakharov human-rights prize), and Zeng Jinyan; the social network guru Isaac Mao, the public intellectual Wang Xiaoshan and the artist Ai Weiwei (recently named &quot;the most powerful artist on earth&quot;). On my final weekend in China, I went to Weiwei&apos;s grey-walled home in the Caochangdi art district. He was with his wife, two aides, a film crew and two lawyers, but as gregarious and mischievous as ever. &quot;It&apos;s hot. Let&apos;s take our clothes off,&quot; said Weiwei, who proceeded to strip to the waist. I was too shy to follow suit. So was everyone else. The lawyers simply proceeded with their brief about the next stage in his tax case. I couldn&apos;t stay. The China story was moving on again. News had just come in that Chen Guangcheng was at Beijing airport, about to board a plane to the US. After six years of house arrest and prison, he was finally flying to freedom. I said my goodbyes and wandered home to write up what felt like an uplifting article to finish on. I knew though, that it was not really the end. For all the hardship Chen endured, I guessed he would miss China. I certainly will. This is a peak and perhaps one for mankind. \u2022 Jonathan Watts will be based in Rio de Janeiro as Latin America correspondent from July."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/18/tesco-japan-sells", "publicationDate": "2012-06-18T19:39:45Z", "tags": ["Tesco", "Japan", "Supermarkets", "Retail industry", "Business", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["There have been upsets though: Tesco abandoned its first attempt to crack Ireland and has previously exited France and Taiwan."], "title": "Tesco offloads Japanese operation", "article": "Tesco is paying rival Japanese supermarket operator Aeon a \u00a340m dowry to take its loss making chain off its hands. After ploughing more than \u00a3250m and the best of a decade into trying to crack one of the toughest retail markets in the world, Tesco boss Philip Clarke hoisted the for sale sign over Tesco Japan last summer. The terms of the deal, however, suggest buyers were in short supply with the British grocer selling a 50% stake for a token sum of Y1 \u2013 less than 1p \u2013 while also pumping \u00a340m into the new joint venture. The arrangement, Tesco said, meant it would have &quot;no further financial exposure to the Japanese business or its operations&quot;. &quot;We are very pleased to announce this deal with Aeon and are confident this will deliver the best outcome for our staff and for our shareholders,&quot; said Clarke. When he called time on Japan last August he said the group had &quot;concluded we cannot build a sufficiently scalable business&quot;. The \u00a340m dowry will be used to refurbish stores as Aeon outlets with the cash helping to preserve employment of Tesco&apos;s nearly 1,000 workforce. Foreign retailers have struggled to conquer Japan due to the toxic combination of intense competition and years of lacklustre economic growth. French giant Carrefour pulled out of Japan in 2005 when some of its stores were also acquired by Aeon. &quot;Without some serious M&amp;A, Tesco were never going to reach the scale required to create a profitable business in what remains one of the most competitive markets on earth,&quot; said Kantar Retail analyst Bryan Roberts. &quot;It makes sense to pull out and this seems a dignified way of doing it.&quot; Clarke has bigger problems than Japan, which was the smallest of Tesco&apos;s 13 international chains. He has taken over the day-to-day running of the grocer&apos;s UK store operation after a shock profit warning in January saw it admit it had been serving its UK shoppers poorly. The UK chain generates two thirds of group profits and had been milked to bankroll international expansion, leading to shabby stores and deteriorating customer service. Last week Tesco reported like-for-like sales down 1.5% in the first quarter as Clarke&apos;s fightback plan struggles to gain traction, which includes more staff on the shop floor as well as store makeovers. His other headache is loss-making US start-up Fresh &amp; Easy which is not expected to break even until next year. Last week&apos;s update highlighted a worrying slowdown at the California based chain with growth of 3.6% compared with more than 12% in the fourth quarter. The Cheshunt-based supermarket chain arrived in Japan in June 2003 when it acquired Tokyo convenience store chain C Two-Network for \u00a3173m. The push was led by former chairman David Reid who at the time described it as a &quot;neat entry&quot; to a market with higher operating margins than in the UK and went on to acquire bankrupt convenience store chain Fre&apos;c. Aeon is expected to buy the rest of the shares in Tesco Japan in the autumn. The retrenchment is a setback for the globe-trotting British retailer, which has spent the past decade planting its red, white and blue flag in countries ranging from Turkey to Thailand. There have been upsets though: Tesco abandoned its first attempt to crack Ireland and has previously exited France and Taiwan. Tesco underestimated the challenges it would encounter in Japan, the world&apos;s third-largest grocery market after China and the US. At last count its market share in Japan was 0.1% compared with more than 30% in the UK. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said the 117 store Japanese chain was losing about \u00a330m a year and had become a distraction. &quot;Tesco appears to our minds to have taken the correct approach with funded withdrawal,&quot; said Black."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/19/microsoft-surface-tablet-analysts", "publicationDate": "2012-06-19T10:22:42Z", "tags": ["Microsoft Surface", "Microsoft", "Tablet computers", "Technology", "Computing", "Software", "Windows", "Windows 8", "iPad", "Android"], "sentences": ["However, tablets are only a tiny fraction of their revenues, and Computex [the computing trade show in Taiwan] was very disappointing when it came to Windows RT; thus it would seem likely that Microsoft has made these launches to demonstrate what is possible with Windows 8, rather than as a virtualisation move.&quot;"], "title": "Microsoft Surface tablet: what the analysts say", "article": "On Monday evening, Microsoft unveiled its Surface tablet \u2013 a own-branded 10.6in device with a keyboard that doubles as a cover, which will come in two forms: one with an ARM chip (&quot;WinRT&quot;), and another with an Intel chip (&quot;x86&quot;). Software can be written to run on both, but unlike Windows PCs, it won&apos;t be exactly the same software on both. The price hasn&apos;t been announced; nor has a delivery date. Here&apos;s what the analysts say: Michael Gartenberg, consumer analyst, Gartner &apos;&apos;This was clearly a referendum on Microsoft&apos;s partners. Microsoft felt they could not rely on others to deliver on their vision for Windows 8 in mobile computing.&quot; Francisco Jeronimo, IDC Research &quot;At the centre of CEO Steve Ballmer&apos;s presentation was a single message: the integration between the hardware and the software is key to deliver better experiences to end-users. The hardware designed by Microsoft tries to capture the interest from users for a device that combines a PC-like and a tablet experiences. Therefore, this tablet is clearly targeted to professional users in the first place. &quot;The physical keyboard, the lack of a camera and the focus on the MS Office environment shows that Microsoft is targeting the business segment, where it can differentiate and take some share from Apple. Microsoft&apos;s tablet will probably come with the best MS Office experience, the killer application of the device. The keyboard is also a very important accessory for a professional usage. &quot;Despite some interesting hardware features, almost nothing was mentioned about the software, the user interface, the user experience and the ecosystem, Some of these points were previously introduced by Microsoft on previous presentations of Windows 8. Microsoft needs to start bringing together the different pieces of the Windows 8 story.  &quot;What makes the iPad the most successful tablet on the market is the software, the applications and the added value that end-users perceive from that. The reason why Android tablets need to be cheap is because they do not deliver value. Besides Apple, no other manufacturer has captured a relevant market share in this segment. The main focus has been on the hardware and specs only.  &quot;What I was expecting to hear from Microsoft is how the Surface delivers an integrated experience with the PC, what additional services or features are available and how the Microsoft ecosystem is growing to be a real alternative to the iPad or any Android tablet. Hardware-wise, Microsoft did a very good job by launching a device that can really be exciting and different. But it needs to deliver what has been promising with the new Windows 8 strategy.  &quot;Consumers will not buy, and specially not pay a premium price for the Surface until they understand what additional value they can get compared with the iPad and how the device integrates with their PCs, gaming console, Windows Phone, etc. The entire ecosystem is what will make Microsoft proposition attractive, not unlinked pieces of it. &quot;Microsoft has also showed how serious it is about controlling the hardware. This tablet could had been announced with any of its partners (or several). But by designing and launching its own branded tablet, Microsoft is clearly refocusing its approach to a more closed strategy. And if that is the case the company will need to take a different route and to acquire a manufacturer that knows and controls the entire supply chain.&quot; Carolina Milanesi, tablets analyst at researchers Gartner &quot;I think Surface serves three main purposes. It allows MS to evangelise on Metro [the Windows 8 interface] in their stores and control their end-to-end message; allows them to bring some sexy back to their brand, and prove that they know what it takes to succeed in the post-PC era; they nudge the [hardware] partners to up their game, either by delivering better specs or lowering their prices. &quot;I do not believe Microsoft see Surface as a big volume driver device in either version, but they establish the benchmark, sell a few at decent margins, and then let the ODM [original device manufacturer, eg HP or Dell] partners drive prices down. Not having 3G [mobile connectivity] makes things easier from a channel perspective [ie, it doesn&apos;t have to be sold with mobile contracts] and considering that the majority of users have been buying Wi-Fi [iPads] it will not be a limiting factor. &quot;Price will be a factor, but as I mentioned, I think these devices are not intended to be big volume drivers, so i would expect them to be competitive with the high-end iPad. Microsoft needs to deliver on time in time for the [Christmas] holidays, if not for back-to-school [early in September] as that might still leave a little time to the ODMs to fine-tune their designs. &quot;I am sure partners are not happy about this, but it is not like they have much choice. [Google&apos;s] Android has so far not helped them, and they do not know yet what Google will do as far as its own hardware goes. At least with Microsoft they know a lot of money will be spent on developers.&quot; Sarah Rotman, Forrester Research &quot;This product line marks a crucial pivot in Microsoft&apos;s product strategy. It blends the Xbox first-party hardware model with the Windows ecosystem model. It puts the focus on the consumer rather than the enterprise. And it lets Microsoft compete with vertically-integrated Apple on more even ground. &quot;I am excited about this product, but it felt like Microsoft was pulling punches with this announcement. Hardware is only part of the dynamic. They need to explain how Microsoft manufacturing this device will change people&apos;s experience with a tablet. Microsoft will be its own worst enemy in this market. More so than Apple or Google, the worst thing that could happen to Microsoft&apos;s Windows RT tablets [with ARM chips] is Windows 8 on [Intel&apos;s] x86. Selling x86-based tablets in the same retail channels as Windows RT tablets will confuse consumers and sow discontent if consumers buy x86 and think they&apos;re getting something like the iPad.  &quot;Microsoft and its partners need to articulate a compelling strategy for how they will manage consumer expectations in the channel. Consumers aren&apos;t used to thinking about chipsets. Choice is a key tenet of Windows, but too much choice is overwhelming for consumers. Apple gets this, and limits iPad options to connectivity, storage, and black\u2026 or white.&quot; Rick Sherlund, Nomura Securities &quot;Microsoft will need to assure other hardware makers that it&apos;s a level playing field. I think this sets a high bar for their partners. &quot;The Windows Surface tablets are both different from iPad in that they have kickstands built in and come with a detachable cover that also serves as a keyboard (albeit probably not ideal). The response to these tablets has been cautiously favourable and the view is that they do a good job of showcasing what Windows 8 has to offer and have the scope to function as both tablets and laptops. &quot;The question on everyone&apos;s lips is: &apos;Well it looks very nice, but how much is it?&apos; We are estimating that the the WinRT tablets will be around $400-500, which could see good volumes, as these tablets are highly differentiated from the iPad and offer functionality to compensate the user for not having access to the highly desirable Apple application ecosystem. &quot;The devices are expected to be made available in the September/October time frame as Windows 8 becomes available on other devices. This is positive for Nvidia [which makes the Tegra chip that powers the ARM-based version] where our best guess is that a pre-build of 4-5m units would drive an incremental $80-100m [revenue] in the back half of the year. Our estimate of $550m from [Nvidia&apos;s] Tegra does not assume any contribution from Win RT in 2012. [Nomura has a &quot;buy&quot; recommendation on Nvidia.]  &quot;This will raise questions for the PC makers, which are Microsoft&apos;s biggest customers and who would now seem to be potential competitors. However, tablets are only a tiny fraction of their revenues, and Computex [the computing trade show in Taiwan] was very disappointing when it came to Windows RT; thus it would seem likely that Microsoft has made these launches to demonstrate what is possible with Windows 8, rather than as a virtualisation move.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jun/19/elt-diary-june-technology-innovation", "publicationDate": "2012-06-19T13:00:21Z", "tags": ["Tefl", "Technology"], "sentences": ["English-teaching robot debuts in Taiwan English language teachers in Taiwan are unlikely to feel under too much threat from a robot programmed to teach English to young learners, which was unveiled at a computer-assisted language learning conference last month."], "title": "Technology leads in English language teaching innovation awards", "article": "Hand-held devices and computer games took centre stage at last month&apos;s ELTons awards in London, demonstrating that technology continues to set the agenda for change in English language teaching.

Milan university switches to teaching in English One of Italy&apos;s leading higher education institutions, Politecnico di Milano, has announced that it will teach most of its degree courses in English from 2014.

The company unveiled the new software at an event in San Francisco on Wednesday, explaining that it will be built on the same core code as its upcoming Windows 8 tablet and PC operating system, expected to be launched in autumn, when the new phone software will also be available. The new phones \u2013 from handset makers Nokia, Samsung Electronics, HTC of Taiwan and China&apos;s Huawei \u2013 will feature voice commands, Skype calling, near-field communication (NFC) for wireless transactions and built-in Nokia maps with turn-by-turn navigation.  Dual-core and more They will also run on dual-core processors, which should improve video and other playback capability. The phones, which will be available in three screen resolutions, will have an updated, customisable start screen in Microsoft&apos;s new &quot;Metro&quot; style, which centers on touchable &quot;tiles&quot; \u2013 large icons \u2013 to represent people, applications and services which update in real time, for example showing Facebook posts or new email. Metro is also the interface for Windows 8. Windows Phone is struggling to keep up with the runaway success of Google&apos;s Android mobile software, for which more than 900,000 devices are being activated every day. The research company Gartner said that in the second quarter Android sales were 56% of the world smartphone market, while Apple&apos;s iPhone had 23%. Rivals such as Windows Phone, RIM&apos;s BlackBerry, and Nokia&apos;s now-outdated Symbian had single-digit shares. However, the success of the phones partly depends on the marketing support they get from carriers, especially in the US where pricing plans minimise differences between products. The largest US mobile operator, Verizon Wireless, said in April that it expected to have Windows Phone 8 devices in time for the Christmas shopping season, as it wanted a strong competitor to the iPhone and Android.  The second-largest US mobile operator, AT&amp;T, and fourth largest, T-Mobile USA, said they planned to carry Windows Phone 8 smartphones later this year. The third-largest US operator, Sprint, declined to comment.  Microsoft said that the use of a common core meant customers would have a greater choice of phones and applications, and be able to switch between multiple machines more easily. The move follows the launch of the Surface tablet on Monday, Microsoft&apos;s effort to join the fast-growing mobile computing market and to tackle Apple&apos;s iPad head on. No upgrade path But existing devices such as Nokia&apos;s Lumia range, which run the current Windows Phone 7.5 version, won&apos;t be able to update to the next version \u2013 and apps written exclusively for Windows Phone 8 won&apos;t run on older handsets. However, existing apps will run on the new platform. It is common on all smartphone platforms for newer apps not to run on older operating software \u2013 but it&apos;s unusual for handsets less than two years old to be unable to upgrade to new software. Apple&apos;s iOS 5, released last October, and forthcoming iOS 6, expected this autumn, will run on the iPhone 3GS, released in summer 2009. Android handsets bought in the same timeframe can usually be upgraded to the latest Android 4.0 software. Greg Sullivan, senior product manager for Windows Phone, said that existing phones would not be able to make the full upgrade because the new software was built to take advantage of certain hardware capabilities \u2013 such as dual-core processors \u2013 which existing Windows Phone handsets did not have. Instead, there would be an &quot;interim&quot; version of Windows Phone \u2013 7.8 \u2013 which would bring a number of core elements from Windows Phone 8 to older devices. &quot;The underpinnings of Windows Phone 7 are the primary reason we haven&apos;t had support for multicore chips \u2026 it&apos;s why we haven&apos;t had LTE [high-speed mobile broadband] on CDMA [the data system used by Verizon], which requires [the next-generation internet protocol] IPv6, and why we haven&apos;t taken advantage of the latest generation of SOCs [system on chips],&quot; Sullivan said. Stall at the stall? Analysts were nonplussed, seeing the break between the existing Windows Phone and the still-unclear release date of the next software as imperilling existing hardware partners \u2013 particularly Finland&apos;s Nokia, which has staked its smartphone future on Windows Phone.  &quot;If Nokia does its job right, consumers will want to upgrade to the next Lumias anyway, so those models [had] better come fast, as [sales of] the [Lumia] 800 and 900 will stall,&quot; Carolina Milanesi, Gartner&apos;s smartphone analyst, observed. &quot;It is certainly not good news for the Lumia 900.&quot; Nokia, which until the start of 2011 was the leader in both the featurephone and smartphone markets, launched its Lumia 900 smartphone in the US in April in an attempt to regain a foothold in that crucial market. But eager buyers who rushed to buy them may be disappointed that their phones will not run the new software. Windows Phone 8 includes a new Wallet hub designed to support NFC payments and the ability to store credit card information, member cards, and frequent flier cards. &quot;Google has the NFC payment part, Apple has the Passbook thing, we&apos;ll have both,&quot; said Sullivan. SD cards can also be used as additional storage, and can be transferred between devices \u2013 giving the phones a capability that Android phones have long had, and which the iPhone lacks. Microsoft&apos;s Windows phones have been well reviewed but have not caught on in the market. Partly that has been unfamiliarity, and partly bad timing: the launch in November 2010 came just as Android handset makers and Apple were hitting their stride, leaving Microsoft \u2013 then without Nokia as a partner \u2013 to try to push the first version of its software with companies which then saw more opportunity in Android. Another factor that has been blamed is that there are only 100,000 or so apps available, compared to 500,000 or so for both Apple and Android devices. Nor has there been the capability to buy add-on functions within an app \u2013 though that will be rectified in Windows Phone 8."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jun/22/working-life-make-up-artist", "publicationDate": "2012-06-22T22:00:39Z", "tags": ["Work & careers", "Money", "Theatre", "Stage", "Culture", "Guardian Careers"], "sentences": ["Cannas worked on The Lion King in Sydney, Melbourne, Shanghai, Johannesburg, Taiwan and Singapore."], "title": "A working life: the make-up artist", "article": "Giuseppe Cannas discreetly pops a strong mint into his mouth as he reaches for his &quot;pouch&quot; \u2013 his black canvas roll of make-up brushes \u2013 and checks his phone before we disappear into the labyrinthine backstage corridors of the National Theatre. &quot;You cannot take any chances if you are leaning over someone doing their make-up \u2013 whether for hours or just minutes,&quot; he smiles.

Sometimes it&apos;s more basic make-up and, at other times, more complex period make-up or special effects. &quot;Often it&apos;s Shakespeare but with a modern, or unusual, take. Our work involves creating images and characters through make-up, hairstyles and prosthetics in accordance with the brief we have been given.&quot; On our way out he shows me the mind-boggling spreadsheet on the wall showing the schedule for technical and dress rehearsals in the run-up to opening nights, previews and press night; along with the locations of the actors&apos; dressing rooms on the floor below, where all but very technically complex make-up will be done. Given that all wigs are made in-house there is surprisingly little time \u2013 often days, rather than weeks \u2013 to get everything ready for productions. In the large airy hair and make-up studio on the fifth floor of the National (it looks out on to an internal courtyard with the feel of a scruffy 1960s&apos; office block) Cannas&apos;s colleague Sarah Lou is &quot;hand-knotting&quot; a multi-layered hippy-style wig for the actress Helen McCrory for her part in the new play The Last of the Haussmans, which opens in just a week&apos;s time. This could take at least 45 hours to complete. In the world of theatre and entertainment, the highly-skilled roles of make-up artist and wig-maker are intertwined, and most courses train people to do both. All the wigs used at the National are created from human hair and made especially for the relevant actors, which means that separate ones are also made for under-studies, too \u2013 even if they are rarely used. Coloured swatches, to help with orders, are stacked up in plastic boxes, and the wigs will usually be styled closer to the production itself, depending on what is required by the designer, Cannas says. Members of his team act as supervisors for individual productions. Cannas has a demanding managerial role at the National, where he reports directly to the Theatre&apos;s Head of Costume. Although he is in charge of a 10-strong department, with all the administrative and financial responsibilities that brings, he likes to keep his hand in, and enjoys &quot;putting on his blacks and grabbing his pouch&quot; to do make-up himself. Blacks \u2013 black clothing \u2013 are typically worn by staff backstage to reduce the chances of being seen by the audience. And Cannas is a big fan of hats \u2013 today he is sporting a black beret, but on other days he favours a sloppy woollen beanie or even a baseball cap. His style is &quot;casual but comfortable&quot;, with practical outfits he could wear to a meeting with director Nicholas Hytner or attending an opening night. Today he has come in especially over the Jubilee bank holiday to lend a hand with a series of workshops the National is running in its &quot;pop-up&quot; space as part of its summer programme, &quot;National Theatre Inside Out&quot;, to demystify and explain its activities to the public. Two members of his team have wig stands and pouches to hand, creating fifties-style makeovers for mums (as their daughters look on in wide-eyed wonder) and a plate of prosthetic &quot;stitches&quot;, warts and putrefying flesh fascinate the little boys. Cannas \u2013 who says he used to enjoy watching his own mother putting on her make-up in front of her dressing table mirror \u2013 unrolls the pouch and, with chuckles of laughter and great enthusiasm, he works some magic of his own. &quot;This is a great line of communication with the public&quot;, he says. &quot;There is something rather elitist about working in TV and the theatre, so we are trying to show what we actually do. People think this is glamorous but it is very long hours.&quot; Cannas&apos;s route to working at the National Theatre began in his native Sardinia where, after studying languages (including Latin and Greek) for his national diploma, he dropped out of an engineering course at university. After compulsory army service in Italy, he came to London at 22 and decided to stay. &quot;My mum said goodbye to me at the airport and gave me three months&quot;, he recalls. &quot;That was 20 years ago.&quot; Although he did not speak English when he arrived, he picked up the language by working as a pizza delivery boy and in a bar, before securing a place on a year-long beauty therapy course at the Hammersmith and West London College. That led him to an HNC and HND in make-up and hairdressing at the University of Westminster, including business studies and marketing &quot;which have been absolutely critical for what I am doing now&quot;. Initially, he did freelance work assisting on big-name advertising campaigns for the likes of designer Alexander McQueen, with whom he also worked on London Fashion Week. Keen to put something back into the English education system, a talent for teaching saw him returning to Hammersmith and West London College where he eventually became a full-time lecturer in hair and make-up for three years, while creating numerous specialist courses in make-up. In 2000 he went to Australia &quot;for love&quot; just as Disney&apos;s touring production of The Lion King was coming to south-east Asia. He became head of hair and make-up, working with a 60-strong cast and a team of six make-up artists to bring the famous two-dimensional characters to life. Cannas worked on The Lion King in Sydney, Melbourne, Shanghai, Johannesburg, Taiwan and Singapore. &quot;It was absolutely fantastic and it was very difficult to say goodbye to the team I had worked for. I think I was married to my job, albeit in not a very healthy way.&quot; Now only 40, he claims the biggest challenge of his working life to date has been stepping into the shoes of Joyce Beagarie, the NT&apos;s former head of wigs, who had been at the National for 38 years until she retired last year. &quot;I was thrilled to get the job but terrified at the same time,&quot; he admits. &quot;I had a very clear idea of what I wanted to do here, which is to make my own mark \u2013 to create another layer. I have an average of six meetings here a week. There is a lot of planning, scheduling and so on, but I am fortunate to have a great team.&quot; I sit in with Cannas on the dress rehearsal of The Last of the Haussmans just hours before the production&apos;s official opening, where about 50 staff, representing various departments including lighting, costume and hair and make-up, gather to scrutinise the final run-through and order changes if necessary. I see Helen McCrory in her (now finished) full-length wig, alongside Julie Walters whose long silver-grey wig - described by one critic as a &quot;mad grey mane&quot; \u2013 has been crimped to within an inch of its life. He thinks it obscures her face at times, so this will be fixed. All the makeup and wigs are applied and fitted one hour before the show in the actors&apos; dressing rooms, and when the make-up is minimal they are taught to do it themselves. Very specific show plots are written to allow a smooth run of quick changes backstage. Interestingly, Cannas says that the make-up and hair are as much for the actors, to help them to get into character, as for those watching the play. &quot;About 80% of the job we do is actually for the actors, not the audience.&quot; And with a chuckle, he is off backstage to touch up Julie Walters&apos;s make-up for the second half."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jun/27/shock-new-cinema-indigenous-peoples", "publicationDate": "2012-06-27T08:57:10Z", "tags": ["Film", "World cinema", "Culture", "Avatar"], "sentences": ["Even when you&apos;re hiding behind a viewfinder.&quot;            Most belligerent of this year&apos;s aboriginal crop in its defiance to the outside world is the Taiwanese film Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale.", "The real target of Seediq Bale&apos;s truculence is China, with whom Taiwan&apos;s relationship remains, in Facebook parlance, complicated.", "Just to rub things in further, Taiwanese films have been doing well at the Chinese box office over the past few months.", "A writer at anthropology blog Savage Minds points out that its stance on Taiwanese history is more sophisticated, putting up the two tribal siblings who adopt Japanese lifestyles as a case for the defence: &quot;In one scene at the waterfall, Mona Rudao asks the elder brother to choose: are you going to the Shinto shrine when you die, or will you walk across the rainbow bridge [the path to the afterlife in the native religion]?"], "title": "Shock of the new: cinema's fascination with indigenous peoples", "article": "When James Cameron took a step on to technological terra incognito in 2009 with Avatar, he leaned on an old fascination for his storyline: indigenous peoples. That moment where hard eyes met uncomprehending ones, and see themselves reflected back, has still got it. It&apos;s in the nature of cameras to be pointed at the unknown, or at least point to where the unknown once was. No surprises then that cinema \u2013 from King Kong to Nanook of the North, classic westerns to mondo, Malick arthouse to Cameron powerhouse \u2013 has long been drawn to those threshold encounters where nothing is the same again. The idea of a place&apos;s original inhabitants is a powerful one in uncertain times when countries and cultures look to fix a sense of their own identity, and the shifting sands of globalisation are driving the current round of indigenous cinema. Xingu, Brazil&apos;s third highest grossing homemade film this year, seems to be discerning the right route forward for a country that is one of the world economy&apos;s current winners. It&apos;s about three brothers who befriend rainforest tribesmen when they take part in the mid-20th century push to break into the interior. They are instrumental in protecting indigenous customs by helping to create the Xingu national park, Brazil&apos;s largest. &quot;The tricky interface between the Brazilian authorities and the natives provides Xingu with much of its drama,&quot; writes the Hollywood Reporter, &quot;as the mechanised march of progress threatens to wipe out much of the area&apos;s rich cultural and ethnic composition&quot;.            It looks as if Xingu is a cheerleader for progressive development, where Latin American culture dealing with native peoples has often had a more conflicted feel. As a mestizo region, there&apos;s a jumbled, ambivalent sense of old and new, of the price to bring about the transition to the modern world: what ancient identities were served up on the altar. In Mexico, the debate over mexicanidad \u2013 the true source of the country&apos;s soul \u2013 has always wafted over the country&apos;s cinema, and was still pungent in 1999, when The Other Conquest, about the conversion of the Aztecs to Christianity after the 1520 Tenochtitlan massacre, became the highest-grossing homegrown film ever at the time. The clever Spanish meta-film Even the Rain, released in the UK in May, recently tried to capture such dense entanglements. Unlike Xingu, it feeds fretfully off the ravages of globalisation in South America, where some have profited since the very first exploitation, and others not. A Mexican film crew, led by Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal&apos;s director, head to Bolivia to shoot a film about Columbus&apos;s exploitation of the New World. They debate their good intentions over dinner each night, in hotels the Quechua Indians hired as extras can&apos;t afford. But the presence of the crew seems to intensify the anti-government protests the Quechuas are mounting against water privatisation. Some of the Mexicans want to pull out, scared at the violence, and at the sense they&apos;re no longer masters of the drama (which, of course, directed in actuality by Ic\u00edar Bolla\u00edn, they&apos;re not). Maybe the tagline could be: &quot;History doesn&apos;t stop. Even when you&apos;re hiding behind a viewfinder.&quot;            Most belligerent of this year&apos;s aboriginal crop in its defiance to the outside world is the Taiwanese film Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale. A 276-minute, two-part barnstormer produced by John Woo, it stars Tai Lin-Ching as Mona Rudao, the scar-etched tribal chief who in 1930 led an uprising against Japanese rule. It&apos;s a strange, unsettling film: wooing us with homilies to ancestral island life is tricky when the local pastimes also involve group decapitation sprees. &quot;A primitive philosophy of warfare [is] glorified by this unabashedly nationalist film,&quot; writes the New York Times. There&apos;s definitely some of that going on. Using the Japanese as villains \u2013 a familiar assignation for them in many mainland-Asian films \u2013 is a clever feint. The real target of Seediq Bale&apos;s truculence is China, with whom Taiwan&apos;s relationship remains, in Facebook parlance, complicated. Wei Te-Sheng&apos;s film is the country&apos;s most expensive ever ($25m), and a firm show of cultural autonomy. Just to rub things in further, Taiwanese films have been doing well at the Chinese box office over the past few months. But Seediq Bale&apos;s attitude to the outside world isn&apos;t pure middle finger. A writer at anthropology blog Savage Minds points out that its stance on Taiwanese history is more sophisticated, putting up the two tribal siblings who adopt Japanese lifestyles as a case for the defence: &quot;In one scene at the waterfall, Mona Rudao asks the elder brother to choose: are you going to the Shinto shrine when you die, or will you walk across the rainbow bridge [the path to the afterlife in the native religion]? They embody a modern psychological conflict. Alongside Rudao&apos;s unambiguous, lofty, epic concept of identity is a more confused, conflicted, contextualized idea.&quot; These in-betweeners would get the mexicanidad debate. We&apos;re a long way from Avatar&apos;s My Little Pony world, where it&apos;s easy to sympathise with the natives when they&apos;re unfailingly noble, 10ft tall and a safe shade of hypothetical blue. Seediq Bale&apos;s skull-collecting bruisers harbour stonier truths. &quot;What shame do you swallow to fulfil your dreams,&quot; wails the soundtrack, as the first part closes with the massacre of the Japanese invaders. The film, despite the bluster, knows the battle is lost; the forces of modernity are always too strong. It&apos;s too busy going down fighting, though, to acknowledge the quiet interloper there at the start: the camera itself, as Even the Rain knows, is part of the apparatus of the ruthless modern world. Cameron&apos;s film can preach its ecological message all it wants. But it&apos;s equally in love with the spirit of technological advance that gave us the film industry, which only paused a century or so later (with the likes of Dances With Wolves \u2013 the story model for Avatar) to start issuing retroactive apologia for those trampled on the path. The camera has its own morality; when it films some things, they are changed for ever. \u2022 Next week&apos;s After Hollywood will look at world-city portmanteau films.

Expected to be called the Nexus 7, it is forecast to be have a seven-inch diagonal screen and run a new version of Google&apos;s tablet software. But some analysts are sceptical that it will be able to make substantial inroads into Apple&apos;s dominant share. The announcement, expected at its I/O developer conference in California, will pitch Google into battle with Apple, whose iPad dominates sales of tablets \u2013 with almost 70% of the worldwide market in the first quarter of 2012 according to researchers IDC \u2013 and with online retailer Amazon, which sells its Kindle Fire tablet in the US and is expected to bring it to Europe later this year. Rather than tackling the 10in iPad head-on, Google is expected instead to attack the Kindle Fire, which also has a 7in screen. &quot;It&apos;s targeting Amazon,&quot; an executive at Taiwan&apos;s Asus, which is believed to be making the device, told Reuters. &quot;The Kindle is based on Google&apos;s platform but with its own service, so Google has to launch its own service, too.&quot; Online rumours suggest it will be called the Nexus 7 \u2013 which would follow the pattern it has followed with its own-brand smartphones, which have all used the Nexus naming convention, even while being made by other companies such as Samsung and HTC. Industry rumours say the Nexus 7 has been made for Google by Taiwan&apos;s Asus \u2013 a surprising move given that Google last August bid for Motorola Mobility, which made the Xoom tablet. That takeover was completed in May. Google has made repeated efforts to break into the tablet market defined by Apple with the launch of the iPad in January 2010. Its first tablet-only software, Android 3.0 \u2013 known as Honeycomb \u2013 introduced in January 2011 was expected to create challengers to Apple&apos;s product, but fewer than 10m sold in the first year, while the iPad sold more than 38m in 2011. The software giant Microsoft has also indicated that it thinks tablets are of growing importance. Last week it announced that it would be offering its own tablet, called Surface, which will run its next Windows 8 operating system \u2013 though it offered no dates or prices for the release. Windows 8 is expected in the autumn, probably in October. And speaking in Amsterdam on Wednesday, Microsoft corporate vice-president Antoine Leblond forecast that &quot;next year, tablets will outsell desktop [PCs]&quot;. According to the researchers IDC, total tablet sales will be almost 105 this year, and will hit 143m in 2013 \u2013 compared to total PC sales of about 400m, of which more than 60% will be laptops. The Nexus 7 is expected to go on sale later this year, and possibly running an as-yet unreleased version 5.0 of Android, called Jelly Bean, rather than the current 4.0 version, Ice Cream Sandwich. Salman Chaudhry, analyst at the research company Context, said the tablet &quot;must run Jelly Bean rather than Ice Cream Sandwich if Google is looking at creating interest and support from the developer community. Google mobile platforms have already suffered from fragmented operating systems as Google continues to work on standardising both operating system and user interface&quot;. He expects pricing to be &quot;in line&quot; with the Kindle Fire, which sells for $199 in the US \u2013 at which price analysts claim Amazon loses money, which it recoups in profit on books, films and other items bought through it. The Kindle Fire was a hit in the US last Christmas, selling an estimated 2m, but sales since have slowed substantially, according to analyst calculations. Amazon has not given any figures for sales. But Chaudhry said: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t expect it to eat into Kindle Fire share either for a number of reasons. Overall, we shouldn&apos;t expect this particular tablet to take on the iPad despite Google&apos;s efforts to differentiate it. Lessons haven&apos;t been learnt from previous Tablet failures. The 7in tablets \u2013 RIM Playbook, HTC Flyer \u2013 have been by and large unsuccessful, and are only really suitable for content consumption. &quot;Against this backdrop, strategy needs to be more aligned towards the Kindle Fire&apos;s purely &apos;content consumption&apos; orientated device. However, if Google is looking to take a bite out of Amazon&apos;s share, it will find that it&apos;s competing against a much more well-developed entertainment orientated platform with a huge, well organised catalogues of books and media content.&quot; Pricing it close to the Kindle Fire&apos;s $199 in the US would suggest that it was not cutting edge, Chaudhry added: &quot;This might make the iPad even more desirable in the consumer&apos;s eyes. By appealing to a demographic which is already price-conscious, average user spend per device will also be lower than on more high-end tablets such as the iPad.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jun/27/hugh-muir-diary-rupert-murdoch-bathroom", "publicationDate": "2012-06-27T23:24:00Z", "tags": ["Politics", "UK news"], "sentences": ["For there is a cautionary tale in Taiwan&apos;s recently published diplomatic archives."], "title": "Hugh Muir's diary", "article": "\u2022 Here&apos;s a question that says everything about the way we live: what will all the many phone-hacking victims do with the money they trouser from News International?

Labour MP Chris Bryant, whose number in this particular lottery came up early, resulting in a \u00a330,000 payout in January, plus his \u00a3383,000 costs, told a Media Society debate this week that he is building a &quot;Murdoch bathroom&quot; in his constituency home in the Rhondda.

He and Gerald Kaufman were granted an audience at Fox Studios in Hollywood. &quot;Never have I seen people so in fear of a boss,&quot; recalled the MP. &quot;He kept banging his rings on the table to make his points. I later told a journalist we had met him in the Betty Grable room. Gerald Kaufman corrected me and said I was wrong.

Some, understandably, recoil from the idea of living with munitions, even for this short period. Just a small number of refuseniks, defence secretary Philip Hammond told the Commons. But you weren&apos;t quite being straight with the house, were you Phil. Yesterday Tower Hamlets residents delivered a petition to the MoD signed by well over a thousand people \u2013 a fair proportion of those directly affected. As to the extent of public &quot;engagement&quot; about which he assured MPs, the question is: where is it? On Saturday, there will be a local demonstration against the missiles too. They&apos;re not against the Olympics in principle. But there&apos;s weaponry enough in east London already. \u2022 A nightmare scenario, meanwhile, at Southwark crown court. For there is a drill that must be followed by those who visit regularly. Mobiles must be off, or at the very least silent. The punishment for disturbing a trial at a crucial moment can be severe. On this occasion, the problem was not just a ringtone. It was a reporter&apos;s phone that, inadvisedly programmed, began relaying Test Match Special at full volume. It was silenced by a man in a state of panic. Thirty seconds later, the amplified commentary, lauding a particularly good shot \u2013 rang out again. The miscreant dashed for the exit as Aggers and co prattled on, and the judge, though stern, let it pass. A cricket fan, we suspect. What if it had been football on 5 Live. \u2022 And a colourful scene elsewhere, as a group of Mexicans keen to highlight the Guardian&apos;s stories alleging sale of airtime by the Mexican station Televisas to particular politicians turns up with a mariachi band in full regalia outside our London offices. For half an hour, they serenade. And many who pass by get into the spirit of the thing; but one man looks disconcerted by what he sees and hears. John Gummer, now Lord Deben, is unused to such displays of flamboyance and colour. But then he was a member of John Major&apos;s cabinet. \u2022 Finally, a warning to William Hague. There may come a time when he has to sign some form of agreement with China. He needs to be careful. For there is a cautionary tale in Taiwan&apos;s recently published diplomatic archives. When the nationalists fled to the island in 1949, they took with them the documents of the Tsung-li yamen, the first foreign affairs ministry established by the Ch&apos;ing court in 1861. The archive is divided into two categories: the &quot;unequal treaties&quot; signed with imperial predators, the most infamous of which is the Treaty of Nanking which ceded Hong Kong to Britain; and the &quot;equal&quot; ones. And it is noticeable that the signatures on unequal treaties are blurred to the point of illegibility. Meanwhile the ones in the equal category are crystal clear. A neat trick. They could resort to invisible ink and we might not cotton on for years.

However the 18-metre boat is one of the most technically advanced in the world. Silent and greenhouse gas-emission free, it can cruise the canals for at least a week on a minimum of fuel. The brainchild of Prof Rex Harris of Birmingham University&apos;s school of engineering is a hydrogen-powered craft, and this week has been one of the stars of a convention in Birmingham that is bringing together key people in the race to find low-carbon transport fuels for ships. The hydrogen on the Ross Barlow is stored onboard in a large-scale metal hydride storage system, which can handle large amounts of hydrogen at room temperature. The hydrogen is released by decreasing the pressure to feed the barge&apos;s fuel cell (an electric battery, in effect). According to Harris, boats are better placed than cars to run on clean hydrogen because the weight of the heavy tank that stores the fuel is immaterial and can replace ballast. &quot;They are at the cutting edge of the hydrogen fuel revolution,&quot; he says. &quot;It is widely recognised that the world has only a few years to meet the urgent challenges of climate change and oil depletion.&quot; Longer terms aims of the Birmingham University project include the development of a canal-side hydrogen refuelling infrastructure, and to generate hydrogen from renewable sources of electricity on suitable sites throughout the canal network. Elsewhere, two British ferry companies are now developing hybrid hydrogen-powered boats, for the Scottish isles and Bristol, but the biggest practical advances in the nascent technology are coming from mainland European countries. Germany and Greece both have hydrogen fuel cell-driven submarines, Turkish students at Istanbul Technical University have built a ferry, a hydrogen-powered boat cruises the Amsterdam canals and there are advanced plans for ocean-going hydrogen container vessels. The increasing price of diesel fuel, the need to reduce carbon emissions, and the soaring cost for railway electrification is also boosting research into a new breed of hydrogen railway trains. Coincidentally, scientists working on hydrogen trains around the world will also meet in Birmingham next week. The first hydrogen-powered locomotive was built for a mine in Canada in 2002 and in the past 10 years, fuell cell trains have been developed in Taiwan, Japan, South Africa, Spain and Denmark with more others planned for China.

The device, announced Wednesday morning at Google&apos;s annual developer conference in San Francisco, has a seven-inch screen. It is plainly not designed to get Apple iPad users to switch. Rather, it is aimed at Amazon&apos;s Kindle Fire tablet. On first glance, it is a vastly better device in almost every way. And at $199, the same price at the Kindle Fire, it should sell. The Nexus 7 unveiling was somewhat anticlimactic, given a torrent of leaks to tech journalists in recent days. And the tablet was one of many products and software upgrades Google announced during the conference keynote. All of it highlighted what becomes clearer every year: Google&apos;s determination to evolve far beyond its roots in search and advertising, into a company that connects information of all kinds to people who want to use it in all kinds of ways. The tablet will run on the latest version of Google&apos;s Android operating system, dubbed &quot;Jelly Bean&quot; in Google&apos;s snack-oriented naming system. (Google says more than 400m Android devices have been activated around the world.) The improvements are incremental, not great leaps forward, but they are impressive and keep Google at least at parity with Apple&apos;s iOS in most ways, and ahead in a few. From appearances, Jelly Bean will run more smoothly than its predecessors, and the built-in applications, such as camera functions, have been significantly enhanced.  More important is what ultimately makes an Android device truly compelling: the resources of Google itself. More and more, Android devices summon key elements of their user experience from the mother ship&apos;s computers \u2013 the Google search engine, maps, and much more. For every improvement in Jelly Bean that makes a device better on a stand-alone basis, there are many tweaks that tie it to the power Google&apos;s immense data resources. Mobile search, for example, combines a variety of services that non-Google mobile devices simply can&apos;t match (yet). What Google hasn&apos;t done, however, is assure users of most of those 400m Android devices that they&apos;ll ever be able to run the latest operating system. That&apos;s because the ecosystem continues to be dominated by device-makers and mobile-carriers that are, in most cases, indifferent \u2013 or outright hostile \u2013 to the upgrade process. Once they&apos;ve sold the devices and lock-in connection plans, they have little incentive to care \u2013 and their customers are stuck. This is one reason why Google&apos;s own Nexus hardware line has become so important. These devices, made in partnership with big hardware manufacturers (Korea&apos;s Samsung for the latest phone and Taiwan&apos;s Asus for the Nexus tablet), are designed to give users the absolute latest operating systems on excellent hardware \u2013 and Google, not a carrier, keeps them updated. Thanks to the great work in the thriving community of Android hackers, I&apos;ve learned how to modify and update my own Android devices, locked down by other sellers, but most users can&apos;t or don&apos;t bother. I probably won&apos;t buy a Nexus tablet, for one main reason: I won&apos;t be able to plug an external memory card into it. For now, I&apos;m quite satisfied with my seven-inch Barnes &amp; Noble Nook tablet, which I&apos;ve modified to run a fairly recent version of Android (it will be some time before Jelly Bean is likely to run smoothly on it). It&apos;s regrettable that Google and Asus left out a way for users to do what is pretty much standard in tablets other than the ones from Apple and Amazon.  Another oddity in the Nexus 7 is the single camera, which faces the user. It&apos;s understandable from a cost-saving standpoint, and Google thinks the camera is more about social interaction than capturing what a user is seeing. Still, one camera is more than you&apos;ll find on the Kindle Fire or Nook. Given Google&apos;s roots in software, it was a bit jarring to see how much hardware dominated the day. Google announced the &quot;Nexus Q&quot;, a device that centralizes streaming of audio and video; I confess, however, that I don&apos;t quite get the appeal of what Google considers a killer feature, turning streaming into a social activity. Even more intriguingly, company co-founder Sergey Brin showed the latest iteration of the still-experimental &quot;Project Glass&quot;, the system that combines eyeglasses with cameras, audio and heads-up projection. In a dazzling stunt to demonstrate the possibilities of this technology, a team of skydivers delivered a pair \u2013 and showed off their capabilities in mid-air \u2013 to the convention center from a blimp above San Francisco. The assembled developers were offered a chance to buy prototype units for $1,500 a pair \u2013 which tells you that the eventual product will be quite affordable once it reaches mass production. The skies above the convention center were clear and blue. But Google and the entire Android ecosystem remain under something of a legal cloud amid Apple&apos;s global patent lawsuits jihad against the operating system and anyone who dares sell an Android device. On Tuesday, Apple notched a small victory when a US district judge temporarily banned the sale of a Samsung tablet running Android. The judge&apos;s ruling has little practical effect; the Samsung device was on its last legs in the marketplace in any event, having been replaced by a newer model (which, no doubt, will be in court soon, too). Apple still has no serious competition in the large-tablet market, but its sue-everywhere strategy is not the reason. No one has offered an alternative that is compelling enough \u2013 and the Nexus 7 tells you that Google doesn&apos;t have a clear idea of how to compete in that space, either. But Google can definitely compete with Amazon&apos;s Kindle Fire. And with this new device, it shows that the seven-inch tablet marketplace will be hyper-competitive in the foreseeable future."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/jun/29/great-american-economic-mirage", "publicationDate": "2012-06-29T10:14:06Z", "tags": ["US economic growth and recession", "Economics", "Business", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "US economy", "Global recession", "Global economy", "Globalisation", "Eurozone crisis"], "sentences": ["The biggest source of this increase came from the 15-percentage-point contribution of Greater China (the People&apos;s Republic, Taiwan, and Hong Kong).", "The remainder of the Asian-led US export impetus is spread out, led by South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan \u2013 all export-led economies themselves and all heavily dependent on a slowing China."], "title": "The great American economic mirage", "article": "In September 1998, during the depths of the Asian financial crisis, Alan Greenspan, the US Federal Reserve&apos;s chairman at the time, had a simple message: the US is not an oasis of prosperity in an otherwise struggling world. Greenspan&apos;s point is even closer to the mark today than it was back then. Yes, the US economy has been on a weak recovery trajectory over the past three years. But at least it&apos;s a recovery, claim many \u2013 and therefore a source of ongoing resilience in an otherwise struggling developed world. Unlike the Great Recession of 2008-2009, there is widespread hope that America has the capacity to stay the course and provide a backstop for the rest of the world in the midst of the euro crisis. Think again. Since the first quarter of 2009, when the US economy was bottoming out after its worst postwar recession, exports have accounted for fully 41% of the subsequent rebound. That&apos;s right: with the American consumer on ice in the aftermath of the biggest consumption binge in history, the US economy has drawn its sustenance disproportionately from foreign markets. With those markets now in trouble, the US could be quick to follow. Three regions have collectively accounted for 83% of America&apos;s export-led growth impetus over the past three years \u2013 Asia, Latin America, and Europe. (Since regional and country trade statistics assembled by the US department of commerce are not seasonally adjusted, all subsequent comparisons are presented on the basis of a comparable seasonal comparison from the first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of 2012.) Not surprisingly, Asia led the way, accounting for 33% of the total US export surge over the past three years. The biggest source of this increase came from the 15-percentage-point contribution of Greater China (the People&apos;s Republic, Taiwan, and Hong Kong). Needless to say, China&apos;s unfolding slowdown \u2013 even under the soft-landing scenario that I still believe is most credible \u2013 is taking a major toll of the largest source of America&apos;s export revival. The remainder of the Asian-led US export impetus is spread out, led by South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan \u2013 all export-led economies themselves and all heavily dependent on a slowing China. Latin America provided the second-largest source of America&apos;s export resurgence, accounting for another 28% of the total gains in US foreign sales over the past three years. Brazil and Mexico collectively accounted for 19 percentage points of that increase. Growth in both economies is slowing significantly, especially in Brazil. But, given the close linkages between Mexican production and US consumption (which is now sputtering again), any resilience in the Mexican economy could be short-lived. Finally, there is the sad case of Europe, which has accounted for 21% of the cumulative growth in US exports over the past three years. Here, the US Commerce Department statistics are not as helpful in pinpointing the source of the impetus, because only a partial country list is published. What we do know is that the UK, Germany, and France \u2013 the so-called core economies \u2013 collectively accounted for just 3.5% of total US export growth since early 2009, with the UK grabbing the bulk of that increase. That suggests that most of America&apos;s European export gain was concentrated in the region&apos;s so-called peripheral economies. And that is clearly a serious problem. Forecasts are always hazardous, but some &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios shed considerable light on what all of this means for the world&apos;s largest economy. Since the second quarter of 2009, US annualised real GDP growth has averaged 2.4%. With roughly 40% of that increase attributable to exports, that means the remainder of the economy has grown at an anemic 1.4% pace. Under a flat-line export scenario, with no rise in US exports, and if everything else remains the same (always a heroic assumption), overall real GDP growth would converge on that 1.4% bogey. That is a weak growth trajectory by any standard \u2013 likely to result in rising unemployment and further deterioration in consumer confidence. Alternatively, in a moderate export-downturn scenario, with real exports falling by 5% over a four-quarter period, real GDP growth could slip below the 1% &quot;stall speed&quot; threshold \u2013 leaving the US economy vulnerable to a recessionary relapse. By way of reference, the assumption of a 5% export downturn pales in comparison with the precipitous 13.6% decline in real exports that occurred in 2008-2009. As such, this &quot;what if&quot; is a cautiously optimistic assessment of the downside risks stemming from weak external demand. All of this underscores one of the more obvious, yet overlooked, implications of an increasingly interdependent world: we are all in it together. The euro crisis is a serious shock and is producing ripple effects around the world. Europe is export-led China&apos;s largest source of external demand; as China goes, so goes the rest of China-centric Asia; and, from there, the ripples reach the shores of an increasingly export-dependent US economy. As recent weakness in employment and retail sales suggests, that may already be happening. Greenspan&apos;s warning in 1998 came at a time when US exports accounted for only about 10.5% of GDP. Today, that share stands at a record-high 14%, as post-crisis America has made a big bet on an export-led revival. The current global slowdown is not on a par with what occurred in the late 1990s or the more wrenching shocks of three to four years ago \u2013 at least not yet. But today&apos;s global downturn can hardly be dismissed as unimportant for the US or anyone else. In an era of globalisation, there are no innocent bystanders. There are certainly no oases of prosperity in the face of yet another major shock in the global economy. America&apos;s growth mirage is an important case in point. \u2022 Stephen S Roach, a member of the faculty at Yale University, was formerly chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia and is the author of The\u00a0Next Asia.  \u00a9 Project Syndicate, 2012.

Right beside you is a big flaming campfire, whose owners offer large amounts of food and water - but only to developers. A little way from that are two other campfires - one very big, but starting to sputter, and offering only limited supplies to developers and ODMs; the other burning more strongly, but parcelling out the most meagre of rations. And the latter has a big guy standing beside it who sometimes takes away your rations if you get too close. The campfires are the iOS market (iPad and iPhone), the PC market and the Android handset market. The iPad market looks great if you&apos;re a developer; OK, so you have to perform some rituals to get the handouts, but it&apos;s good when it&apos;s good. For ODMs, though (and indeed for also-ran developers), the iPad offers no sustenance.  The PC market, by contrast, is long-established, but it&apos;s not growing - there are in fact strong signs that it&apos;s going into reverse as tablets become a bigger part of our life - and for ODMs, the pickings are thin unless you&apos;re selling in huge volumes into the Far East, and especially China (as Lenovo is). For HP, the PC division is its least profitable; Dell barely makes any money from its consumer market (which is just selling PCs). And Android handsets are a great business - if you&apos;re Samsung. For Sony, Motorola Mobility, LG.. it&apos;s terrible. And developers, while plentiful, aren&apos;t rolling in cash. And now in this scenario, Microsoft and Google have fired two flaming arrows into the air. Their hope: that they&apos;ll start two new fires to rival the iPad&apos;s. Yet the risk is that they&apos;ll do exactly the same - sustaining developers and not ODMs. The Surface: when will it reach land? The Surface first. What&apos;s really bizarre about this device is that even while Microsoft has been talking up Windows 8 and the Metro interface and the &quot;slate&quot; format, it also went ahead and rush-launched this sort-of product.  That the Surface press conference was a rush is evident from the secrecy and unpreparedness. Mutiple sources in and around Microsoft UK have told me that they had no idea ahead of time that it was happening. The four-day advance warning was short enough, but even Microsoft&apos;s headquarters doesn&apos;t seem to have got its strategy figured out. There were no prices, no dates, the minimum of specifications, and what seems to have dribbled out is that Surface will be Wi-Fi only, with no 3G. (The latter point won&apos;t make it popular with enterprises; business people actually value the 3G iPad&apos;s connectivity when out and about, though it simplifies the software.) Most of all, the company that is known above all for its software didn&apos;t show any software worth the name running on its machine. After the press conference, there was very limited time to use them afterwards; nobody seems to have used the plastic keyboard with a live screen to any extent. (I&apos;ve asked people who used the devices at the press conference, and yes, I&apos;ve seen Danny Sullivan&apos;s report. He&apos;s not exactly right on every point - from my understanding of it - but is right that nobody got to properly try the keyboard covers to do any amount of typing.) Sullivan&apos;s post is revealing, though. Here&apos;s a key part, where he shows a photo of some hands holding a Surface:   That&apos;s not a journalist holding Surface. It&apos;s one of the Microsoft guys. They&apos;d swing them around with a pretty picture on the front, I guess so we&apos;d go &quot;ooh&quot; and &quot;ahh.&quot; If we were lucky, we were allowed to hold one for a few seconds. But if you tried to do anything with it, bang, it was gone. Believe me, I know. I tried. I had kept hearing everyone on Twitter screaming about how no one at Microsoft was saying what the screen resolution was. Since it was such a big uber-secret, I figured I&apos;d try to find out. After asking repeatedly if I could hold one \u2014 I felt like a seven-year-old, &quot;please can I hold it, please can I try, would you mind if I try&quot; \u2014 one of the Microsoft guys gave me a shot. I brought up the Start screen by hitting the Windows button on the front of the tablet, hit Desktop to get to the Windows 8 desktop, did a long press guessing that would bring up the Screen Resolution setting and it did \u2014 at which point, the unit was literally jerked out of my hands.  Why would a software company show off its big hardware bet on a new form factor where it hasn&apos;t made any impact and yet not show any software?  Because with Surface, Microsoft is trying to gee up developers to aim towards having tablet and Metro apps for the time when it comes out - at some uncertain point in the future. Surface isn&apos;t ready. Windows 8 isn&apos;t ready - it hasn&apos;t been released to manufacture yet, and the demonstrations at TechEd 2012 in Amsterdam indicate that there are still glitches to be ironed out.  Flocking problem But Microsoft needs at least two things to happen: ODMs to start building tablets, and developers to start writing apps that will run on those tablets.  There&apos;s another, simpler explanation of the rush to show off Surface: getting the PR boost from being ahead of Google, whose Nexus tablet launch was intended to be made to look like a third entrant into a race. The problem is that Surface, and Windows 8, doesn&apos;t exist yet. So are developers rushing to follow that flaming arrow? Not so far. They don&apos;t know quite when or where it&apos;s going to land. They&apos;re sort of hoping to follow the ODMs, because wherever they run to usually means that there&apos;s replenishment to be had. The ODMs, of course, think the same about the developers; you end up with behaviour that looks like a flock: nobody&apos;s the leader, but everyone knows what they should do - follow the leader.  But especially in this case, the ODMs aren&apos;t really sure about following Microsoft&apos;s flaming arrow. Quite probably Steve Ballmer&apos;s team has taken advantage of a contract manufacturer in China to make the Surface. It&apos;s intriguing that Taiwan&apos;s Digitimes, usually a reliable channel of the latest rumours from the ever-gossipy contract manufacturers, hasn&apos;t ferreted out the Surface maker; that either means Microsoft is imposing Apple-style secrecy on the process - in which case, round of applause - or that they just haven&apos;t started making it in volume yet. Either way, don&apos;t expect anything ahead of October. The flaming arrow is still in the air and is yet to land. Microsoft is hoping, really hoping, that developers will start running after it. The trouble is that they don&apos;t seem to be. On Wednesday I sat through a two-hour presentation of Windows 8 at TechEd 2012 in Amsterdam, after which Barry Collins of PC Pro magazine muttered &quot;well, that&apos;s been a demo of eight applications that we&apos;ve already seen before.&quot; Which was true: there wasn&apos;t a single thing in app terms which hadn&apos;t been there at Build. Nothing new at all. And that fact alone indicates that developers aren&apos;t moving very quickly after the flaming arrow 0 or indeed the other ones shot into the air ahead of Windows 8. Nexus: joining the tablet threads together And now the next flaming arrow: the Google Nexus 7, made by Asus as a showcase for Google&apos;s tablet ambitions. Quite a bitter pill for Motorola Mobility, which was favoured with the first release of Honeycomb, aka Android 3.0, in January 2011 - remember everyone&apos;s favourite iPad-killer, the Xoom? - but Google seems serious. Andy Rubin, the head of Android, told AllThingsD that he analysed the market in mid-2011 and realised that for consumers (who were the principal market), what mattered was content (such as apps and music and video). Android tablet sales haven&apos;t set anything on fire, of course - ODMs and developers pick up scraps from the fire of handsets, but there isn&apos;t the volume and so no scale. For app developers, you might as well focus on the handset market, because it&apos;s busy, thriving and expanding. Android tablets.. not so much. And now Google has fired an arrow away from the iPad, towards the 7in, low-cost territory. Carolina Milanesi, Gartner&apos;s smartphone analyst, puts it like this: &quot;Microsoft has done Surface to revamp its brand and give a clear sign that it will be part of the post-PC era as much as it was part of the PC one. Android with Nexus 7 is adding to the smartphone facility as a medium to deliver its content and services. It is a means to an end - owning you as a consumer in their ecosystem while at the same time nudging ODMs to move into the $199 sweet spot for consumers.&quot; But do the ODMs want to be nudged? Posslby they haven&apos;t got a choice. Amazon, explains Milanesi, &quot;was interested in extending the Kindle family and concentrating on selling its content. The Nexus 7 will be competing more with the Kindle Fire, while Surface will compete more with iPad within the professional user and enterprise market. Both the Nexus 7 and Surface are more important for the impact they will have in their ecosystems, not the number of sales they will achieve, as their distribution is limited.&quot; Reaction from people who&apos;ve laid hands on the Nexus 7 has been positive - it runs the software and it&apos;s attractive. The price is attractive too. When you compare the Surface and the Nexus 7, you&apos;d have to say that right now one is almost vapourware, while the other is already coming out of Asus factories somewhere in the Far East. Especially compared to Android, Windows 8 doesn&apos;t exist on tablets. The Microsoft (App) Store isn&apos;t properly open, and you can&apos;t buy - or even pre-order - a Surface. Steve Ballmer stole a march on Google for publicity, but that&apos;s all it&apos;s been. Yet nothing&apos;s really changed about the campfires. For ODMs, there are few pickings to be had anywhere, unless you&apos;re Samsung. And those two flaming arrows are in the air. The question now is which way the developers are going to run. They don&apos;t seem to be running after Windows 8 very quickly, if the TechEd demos are anything to go by. Oh Dear Me But for ODMs, where&apos;s the joy in Android tablets? Tim Anderson points out that Google&apos;s quite a threat to them on its own: he tried out a pretty dire 7in Android tablet by Gemini running Ice Cream Sandwich: &quot;I thought the JoyTAB was at least good value at \u00a3149.00. What chance does it have against a Nexus 7 for just \u00a310 more \u2013 and with \u00a315 of Play Store credit thrown in?&quot; In the short term? None, really, and ODMs will have to hope that distribution of the Nexus 7 will be limited. Google is clearly subsidising its cost - Asus wouldn&apos;t retail a product with those qualities at that price, because there would be a negative margin in it.  But by selling it in the US and Europe, the two biggest tablet markets outside China and Korea, Google&apos;s cutting other ODMs - including Motorola, which of course it owns - off at the knees. All that ODMs have left is the knife-fight of low-cost selling in those countries, where price is all. Developers aren&apos;t interested in that; people who buy those tablets don&apos;t pay for apps. For ODMs, then, the darkness is gathering. PC sales aren&apos;t growing (and most have long since been commodities). Android handsets are commodities. Windows 8 tablets, which might be money-making, are a guess at best. Google&apos;s slicing into their potential market for tablets. They&apos;ll be praying that those arrows land soon and start a nice, warming fire."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/29/wimbledon-2012-maria-sharapova-hsieh", "publicationDate": "2012-06-29T18:20:33Z", "tags": ["Wimbledon 2012", "Maria Sharapova", "Wimbledon", "Tennis", "Sport"], "sentences": ["If Sharapova is one thing, however, she is a formidable competitor and she had too much power for the lightweight challenge of Hsieh of Taiwan."], "title": "Wimbledon 2012: Maria Sharapova too strong for Hsieh Su-wei", "article": "When the wind picks up, as it did at Wimbledon on Friday, Maria Sharapova&apos;s serve can start to resemble a game of pin the tail on donkey. In the second set against Hsieh Su-wei, with her ponytail fluttering and the frills on her dress flapping wildly, the Russian looked particularly discombobulated. One time, break-point down, on her second serve, Sharapova tossed the ball skywards, threw her racket in its general direction and the ball crashed into the grass halfway up her side of the court. It was the kind of shot you would expect to see on the municipal courts at the weekend, not from the world No1. If Sharapova is one thing, however, she is a formidable competitor and she had too much power for the lightweight challenge of Hsieh of Taiwan. Despite having her service broken twice in the second set, she came through 6-1, 6-4 to take her place in the last 16. Even when Hsieh was 4-2 up in the second set, the result was never seriously in doubt. Now 26, she is enjoying her highest singles ranking \u2013 the low 60s \u2013 but she lacks the firepower to worry any of top players.One of her first serves was recorded at a glacial 68mph and she won under half the points on her serve throughout the match. Sharapova, meanwhile, looked almost wild-eyed with determination \u2013 screaming &quot;Come on!&quot; at one moment like she had secured a match point to take the championship. Fully fit, still high on her victory at Roland Garros, she looks more and more the irrepressible favourite in the women&apos;s draw, repeating her success of 2004 when she won as a 17-year-old. You feel, as the tournament goes on, her fears will be more meteorological than the player on the other side of the net. Playing for the right to be grunted at by Sharapova were Hsieh&apos;s doubles partner Sabine Lisicki and the 19-year-old American Sloane Stephens. Throughout an error-strewn first set, you could have been forgiven for thinking that neither of them fancied the prospect too much. Rallies were a rarity, mostly won by Stephens, while Lisicki&apos;s punchy first serve \u2013 she hit one here last year at 124mph and is regularly in the one-teens \u2013 kept her in contention. It went to a tie-break, Stephens bolted to a 5-2 lead and then lost the next five points to hand Lisicki the set. In the second set, Stephens began to show why she is being compared to Serena Williams \u2014 beyond the fact that the pair are now, in her word, &quot;besties&quot;. She has a booming forehand, a smooth service action and she is already the highest-ranked teenager in the world (currently 59, but she will be inside the top 50 after this tournament). In half an hour, she came through 6-1. But Lisicki, seeded 15, is class on grass; she reached the semi-finals of the singles here last year and the final of the doubles. She blew away Stephens in the final set 6-2 setting up a repeat of that semi-final with Sharapova, which she lost in straight sets. In the previous round, Lisicki complained about the grunting of her Serb opponent Bojana Jovanovski \u2013 if Sharapova, who famously is like standing 3ft from a chainsaw, raises the volume then the German will make some noise of her own. &quot;The grunting put me off last match,&quot; said Lisicki afterwards. &quot;That&apos;s why I complained. It was better afterwards.&quot; The winner of that match will have a quarter-final showdown with either Angelique Kerber or Kim Clijsters. Clijsters was the last woman standing on Court One against 12th seed Vera Zvonareva; the Belgian had come into the match with a stomach-muscle strain, but it was Zvonareva who needed a 10-minute injury time-out in the second set. She looked short of breath and was crying and eventually defaulted with a &quot;respiratory illness&quot; while down 6-3 4-3."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/05/wimbledon-2012-olympic-tennis", "publicationDate": "2012-07-05T21:03:58Z", "tags": ["Wimbledon 2012", "Wimbledon", "Olympic Games 2012", "Olympics 2012: tennis", "Tennis", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "sentences": ["Depending on the intentions of Andy Murray, the two could even be on the same side of the court in Olympic colours but here it was Fleming and his partner, Hsieh Su-wei of Taiwan, who triumphed, their 7-6, 7-6 victory over Robson and another Englishman, Dominic Inglot, taking them into the quarter-finals."], "title": "Wimbledon 2012: Colin Fleming has taste of Olympic things to come", "article": "The Olympic tennis event may be a few weeks away yet but there was something of an audition on Thursday as the English starlet Laura Robson was outshone by Scotland&apos;s Colin Fleming.

A statement on the Chinese ministry of defence&apos;s website said a navy frigate had been accidentally grounded near Half Moon Shoal in the South China Sea while carrying out routine patrols on Wednesday night. There were no casualties and the navy was organising its rescue, added the report, which appeared shortly after the Sydney Morning Herald broke news of the collision. It is unclear how badly the vessel was damaged. The area is about 60 nautical miles (111km) west of the Philippine province of Palawan in an area claimed by Manila. The Philippines military told Associated Press that the shoal was well within the country&apos;s territorial waters. &quot;We have to hear from them what happened. If it is in distress, we&apos;re always ready to provide any assistance,&quot; said Brigadier General Elmer Amon, the deputy regional commander. Rory Medcalf, director of the international security programme at the Lowy Institute, said it was surprising to see the Chinese using naval vessels to patrol the disputed area. &quot;This raises lots of questions \u2026 They have been relying primarily on civilian forces,&quot; he said. &quot;That does mean sooner or later we will see confrontational incidents involving naval vessels rather than civilian agencies. &quot;Secondly, it raises concerns about the quality of seamanship. If this had been a near-run with a ship from another country, it could have ended badly, with political implications.&quot; Ian Storey of the Institute of South-east Asian Studies in Singapore said that while the grounding was in itself unlikely to escalate tensions, it indicated the growing militarisation of the waters. &quot;Resolution of the dispute is even further out of reach,&quot; he added. &quot;No one seriously envisages a major conflict in the South China Sea because it&apos;s not in anyone&apos;s interests. They depend on those sea lanes for the continued functioning of their economies. &quot;The real risk is that an accidental clash occurs and escalates. In my mind, it is just a matter of time before one of these standoffs gets really ugly and people get killed.&quot; Tensions have been building in the area since 2007, with increasing keenness to claim the energy resources, and growing pressure from nationalists in several of the countries. Vietnam has seen unusual street protests over the dispute in the past few weeks. &quot;Add to all that the intensified US-China competition, with the Americans supposedly coming back to Asia, and you have all the ingredients for the muddle we have now,&quot; added Medcalf. Beijing and Manila have already engaged in a tense standoff at Scarborough Shoal, after the Philippines accused Chinese fishermen of poaching in its exclusive economic zone. China says the area has belonged to it since ancient times. Both sides sent government vessels to the area, although the Philippines has now withdrawn its ships. Earlier this week, Asean members announced they had agreed a code of conduct governing maritime rights and navigation in the region and procedures for handling disputes. But further talks with China would be required to reach agreement on a legally binding set of rules. China argues that the territorial disputes should be tackled bilaterally, opposing attempts to handle them collectively. Hillary Clinton and China&apos;s foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, sought to strike a more amiable note on the issue as they met in Cambodia on Thursday. But the US secretary of state urged China to open talks on the code, adding: &quot;No nation can fail to be concerned by the increase in tensions, the uptick in confrontational rhetoric, and disagreements over resource exploitation. &quot;We have seen worrisome instances of economic coercion and the problematic use of military and government vessels in connection with disputes among fishermen.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/25/care-in-global-community", "publicationDate": "2012-07-25T07:30:00Z", "tags": ["social care network: international social work hub", "Social Care Network", "Stockholm 2012", "Work practices", "Policy", "Social care", "Society"], "sentences": ["Sven Hessle, chair of the programme committee, added: &quot;We tend to work in different rooms \u2013 the practitioners, the politicians, the NGOs and the academic world \u2013 but in this case the message is: we are meeting as a network.&quot; Through a series of 170 workshops held across three days, initiatives as diverse as\u00a0a\u00a0football project for unemployed youths in Nigeria, community work in villages devastated by a typhoon in Taiwan, the development of Brazil&apos;s social security system and child protection work with Palestinian refugees in Nepal were described and discussed."], "title": "Care in the global community", "article": "For a social worker, possibly feeling overworked and undervalued, the idea of spending five days in Sweden discussing policy and\u00a0practice might seem a luxury of doubtful relevance. But frontline professionals joined academics and social-work students in Stockholm earlier this month for what is thought to be the biggest global conference of the social sphere. And they were urged to &quot;make a re-commitment to make a difference in the world&quot;. The Joint World Conference on Social Work and Social Development looked at social work in its broadest sense. In fact, the conference heard, there is no international consensus on what constitutes social work \u2013 or, as one delegate put it, &quot;the term social work is up for grabs&quot;. Around 2,500 attendees from more than 100 countries were at the conference, which \u2013 in the words of Eva Holmberg-Herrstr\u00f6m, chair of the organising committee \u2013 provided &quot;a platform where we meet to exchange experiences&quot;. Sven Hessle, chair of the programme committee, added: &quot;We tend to work in different rooms \u2013 the practitioners, the politicians, the NGOs and the academic world \u2013 but in this case the message is: we are meeting as a network.&quot; Through a series of 170 workshops held across three days, initiatives as diverse as\u00a0a\u00a0football project for unemployed youths in Nigeria, community work in villages devastated by a typhoon in Taiwan, the development of Brazil&apos;s social security system and child protection work with Palestinian refugees in Nepal were described and discussed. Delegates also had the chance to go on\u00a0field visits to see how services are delivered around Stockholm. These included a meeting with Sweden&apos;s children&apos;s ombudsman, a trip to a care home for older people and a look at how the country is introducing welfare-to-work programmes. But despite countless presentations of frontline practice in contrasting environments, what shone through from the conference was the common ground of social work around the world. Gary Bailey, president of the International Federation of Social Workers, said social work improved the lives of children and families, and professionals had &quot;long been society&apos;s safety net&quot;. Current economic, environmental, political and social crises meant demand for social workers&apos; support would only increase, he added. But squeezed budgets and insufficient training places raised the prospect that demand might not be met. Walter Lorenz, an academic from Italy and leading authority on European social work \u2013 who delivered the final day&apos;s Eileen Younghusband memorial lecture \u2013 warned that social-work values were under threat.\u00a0 He urged social workers not to become complicit in the process of choosing the deserving and the undeserving, the worthy and the unworthy, as countries reduced health and welfare provision. Social workers, he said, must &quot;stand up for the rights of people&quot;. Attendees were encouraged to find their campaigning voice, become champions of social justice and speak out on behalf of the people they work with. Vishanthie Sewpaul, senior professor in the school of applied human sciences at the University of KwaZulu Natal, Durban, told the conference: &quot;As social workers, I think we need to make a re-commitment to make a difference in the world \u2026 We need to reclaim social work as a human-rights profession.&quot; It is not only in the UK that social work is facing criticism (perhaps more from inside the profession than outside it) that it has lost its radical edge. Holmberg-Herrstr\u00f6m said social workers in Sweden had been active campaigners 10 or 15 years ago, but &quot;something happened and they closed their mouths, they went silent&quot;. Michael Lavalette, co-ordinator of the Social Work Action Network, said social-work colleagues concerned about the impact of the coalition government&apos;s welfare reforms on\u00a0their clients had not wanted to be seen publicly backing campaigns against cuts. But Christian Rollet, the outgoing president of the International Council on Social Welfare, told delegates: &quot;You are collectively the best experts on social issues because you are working closely with the people.&quot; Service users&apos; voices were heard at the conference too. A new international network called PowerUs is bringing together\u00a0university lecturers, students, service users and carers. Delegates from the network attended the conference in T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan &quot;Mend the gap&quot;. PowerUs hosted a workshop on how service users are involved in research, education and policymaking in projects in the UK, Norway and Sweden. Network member Cecilia Heule, of Lund University in Sweden, explained: &quot;We talk about people differently if they are in the room.&quot; The conference, which was organised by the International Federation of Social Workers, the International Council on\u00a0Social Welfare and the International Association of Schools of Social Work, was the second of its kind. The first was held in Hong Kong in 2010. In 2014, the organisations will collaborate again for a joint world conference in Melbourne, Australia. In the meantime, the organisations will campaign on their Global Agenda for Social Work and Social Development, an initiative that aims to raise the morale and influence of\u00a0professional practitioners. The agenda advocates &quot;a new world order&quot; that recognises human rights and aims to address\u00a0inequalities. As part of the closing ceremony in Stockholm, an open-microphone session gave delegates the chance to share their\u00a0views about the conference, and what they would carry away from the conference hall and into their practice and studies. Many said they wanted to capture the campaigning momentum and focus of\u00a0the event. But the final word went to a service user who told delegates and officials: &quot;Sometimes you heard me, sometimes you didn&apos;t \u2013 but thank you for being there.&quot; This article is published by Guardian Professional.

The brief measure calls for action to be taken in the current centenary year of the birth of Turing, who was convicted of gross indecency with another man in 1952 when such sexual encounters were unlawful.     Growing sunflowers in Manchester to test a Turing maths puzzle - one of the centenary celebration events. Photograph: Alamy    The one-page bill was laid before the Lords this morning, Wednesday 25 May, by Lord Sharkey, the Liberal Democrat peer who lobbied the government unsuccessfully in February for a pardon. The refusal prompted the leading American mathematician Dennis Hejhal to call for &quot;an appropriate hullabaloo&quot; in the UK. This has duly happened, with celebrations of Turing&apos;s life interspersed with increasing pressure for action beyond the public apology for the scientist&apos;s treatment by the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2006. Lord Sharkey, who has enlisted all-party support in both houses of Parliament, says:  We are talking about a great man, an exceptionally great man, whose mind changed the course of science - and the course of the Second World War.  Turing is increasingly acknowledged as the &apos;father of the computer&apos;, whose work at Manchester university built on outstanding service at the secret Bletchley Park code-cracking centre during the war. This part of his life won him an OBE after VJ Day but was not known to his colleagues when he was prosecuted after reporting a young man to police as a suspected thief. The cruelty of Turing&apos;s treatment, though not exceptional at the time, was made worse that it led to a course of hormone therapy, or &apos;chemical castration&apos;. He was found dead from cyanide poisoning at his home two years later and an inquest concluded that he had committed suicide. Lord Sharkey&apos;s measure is called the Alan Turing (Statutory Pardon) Bill and reads in full:  A Bill to give a statutory pardon to Alan Mathison Turing for offences under section 11 of the Criminal Amendment Act 1885 of which he was convicted on 31 March 1952.BE IT ENACTED by the Queen&apos;s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:\u20141 Statutory Pardon of Alan Mathison Turing(1) Alan Mathison Turing, who was born on 23 June 1912 and died on 8 June 1954, and who was convicted of offences under section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 (gross indecency between men) at the Quarter Sessions at Knutsford in Cheshire on 31 March 1952, is to be taken to be pardoned for those offences.(2) This Act does not affect any conviction or sentence or give rise to any right, entitlement or liability, and does not affect the prerogative of mercy.2 Short title(1) This Act may be cited as the Alan Turing (Statutory Pardon) Act 2012.(2) This Act extends to England and Wales.  Lord Sharkey says:   Today, this campaign takes a step forward. I have introduced into the House of Lords a Bill which will, if it becomes law, grant a pardon to Dr Turing.Alan Turing was a truly great Briton. He was the father of computing; his legacy is with us every time anyone uses a computer anywhere in the world.He also helped save this country. His work on cracking the Enigma Code at Bletchley Park during World War II undoubtedly changed the course of the war and saved many thousands of lives. But instead of being rewarded by his country, he was cruelly punished and convicted simply for being gay. If my Bill becomes law, as I hope it will, then this will finally go some way towards acknowledging the debt we all owe to Alan Turing and grant him the free pardon he so clearly deserves.  The bill&apos;s co-sponsors are Ian Stewart, Conservative MP for Milton Keynes south and the Liberal Democrat MPs for Cambridge and Manchester Withington, Julian Huppert and John Leech. Lord Sharkey said that other colleagues from the three main parties at Westminster were campaigning for the measure.     Alan Turing as a public schoolboy. In his mid-thirties, he was set to run for Britain in the 1948 London Olympic Games    John Leech says:  This man was hero. It&apos;s a simple as that. And no one should treat heroes like this.  The news was welcomed by organisers of the current Alan Turing Year which is holding worldwide events from academic conferences to statue unveilings and the growing of sunflowers by children in Manchester to test one of the scientist&apos;s numerical theories. Professor Barry Cooper of Leeds university, chair the celebrations, says:      He even got a GoogleDoodle this year...  Photograph: Google    This is a great step forward, especially at a time when the eyes of the world are on us because of the Olympic Games. Remember that, amid all his other achievements, Alan Turing would almost certainly have run for Britain in the last London Olympics in 1948, had it not been for an injury. His scientific significance is colossal, and yet we have this blot on our history that is just not going to go away until we secure a pardon.The Turing Centenary celebrations have been beyond what anyone expected, with over 30 countries staging events from Mexico to Finland, New Zealand, Taiwan, Korea, Switzerland and the USA etc etc. Quite amazing. And the outcome of this is an international focus on the UK recognition of Turing, and our willingness to at least attempt some sort of straightening of the record.  The bill is likely to face opposition on grounds of precedent and the singling out of Turing largely because of his fame, while less notable victims of past prejudice do not receive the same recompense. Cooper says:  We understand that argument but it should not stop us from getting on with the case of someone who was indeed exceptional. Can you imagine us treating Charles Darwin or Sir Isaac Newton like this?  The Guardian Northerner has regular posts on the Turing affair in the last year.

Most attempts at cocking a snook at\u00a0Coke have missed the point. A Pepsi T-shirt, Lord Coe may be surprised to hear, is not actually a revolutionary image on a par with the face of Che Guevara. And fans of Mecca Cola and Iran&apos;s Zam Zam Cola have found a way around Coke&apos;s American origins, but may not have considered its prejudicial effects on health. Venezuelans who don&apos;t take drinking orders from Ch\u00e1vez might opt\u00a0for something in between healthy fruit juice and capitalist fizz, the popular chicha de arroz, a mixture of condensed and evaporated milk, sugar and rice. There are plenty of interesting sweet drinks around the world. Provocative T-shirts may or may not be available. Czechoslovakia: Kofola Ch\u00e1vez wasn&apos;t the first to decide that revolutionary socialism needed to fight Coke. In the former Czechoslovakia in 1960, caffeinated black stuff left from roasting coffee beans was used to make Kofola, a dark, fizzy soda with 30% less sugar than capitalist Coke, and no phosphoric acid. It is still popular today. Italy: chinotto Where there is an Italian community, there is chinotto. Made from the fruit of\u00a0the myrtle-leaf orange tree, as is Campari, it looks a bit like Coke, but is not as sweet and has been produced in Italy since the 1950s. Coca-Cola has fought back by producing its own version, Fanta Chinotto. Spain: horchata This Valencian favourite looks like milk, but don&apos;t be put off. Its name, according to legend, came from King Jaime of Aragon. Told it was made from tigernut milk, he replied: &quot;Aixo no es llet, aixo es or, xata!&quot; (&quot;That&apos;s not milk, it&apos;s gold, darling!&quot;). It is certainly worth a medal. Though equally refreshing, it shouldn&apos;t be confused with Mexican horchata, a kind of liquid rice pudding that is good with spicy food. India: lassi Also good with spicy food is thick lassi, yoghurt blended with water and fruit pulp or spices, such as turmeric, cumin and mint. There is also the Iranian doogh, or the Turkish ayran, so popular that it is served by another Olympic sponsor, McDonald&apos;s. Mexico: agua fresca If it is hot during the Olympics, Mexican athletes will be wishing they could cool off with iced fruit juices, aguas frescas. One of the best is &quot;Flor de Jamaica&quot;, made with hibiscus, also popular in the country it is named after. Usain Bolt has surely tried it. Taiwan: bubble tea This mix of tea and fruit syrup has swept the world since it was thought up in the 1980s. Imagine a sweet tea smoothie with the thrill of sucking up &quot;bubbles&quot; of sweet &quot;frogspawn&quot; (tapioca) found at the bottom.

But China responded strongly at the meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) in Geneva, challenging delegates to &quot;show us the evidence that [tiger farms] encourage poaching of wild tigers&quot;. There are thought to be around 3,000 tigers remaining in the wild, reduced from a population of 100,000 in 1900. Conservationists warn that they may become extinct in the wild in the next 20 years. China banned trade in tiger parts in 1993, but since then the country&apos;s large-scale commercial breeding of tigers in captivity has boomed. There are now more than 5,000 tigers in around 20 farms run as tourist attractions by politically influential businessmen. There are also tiger farms in Thailand, Vietnam and Laos. In 2007, governments meeting at Cites agreed to phase out tiger farms, but without a clear plan or date for doing so. On Wednesday, India and the UK said it was time to take action. However, Wan Ziming, China&apos;s Cites delegate, told the Guardian: &quot;There is no evidence that farming of tigers threatens wild tigers.&quot; The majority of wild tigers, around 1,700 Bengal sub-species, are found in India, which is the country doing the most to protect them. In the past five years, India has set up a special tiger protection force, increased its tiger habitats by voluntary eviction of human populations from conservation zones, villagers receive compensation and rehousing and are also compensated when their livestock are eaten by tigers. On Tuesday, India&apos;s supreme court took the unprecedented step of banning all tourism in the central &quot;core zones&quot; of tiger reserves. The temporary ban, which will be revised after a month and which takes place during India&apos;s monsoon closures, is in response to conservationists&apos; concerns about unsustainable numbers of tourists crowding sensitive areas. India says that the biggest threat faced by its tigers is from poachers \u2013 a problem that is escalating. More than 200 tiger part seizures have been made annually since 2009 according to Traffic, a group that monitors trade in wildlife. The biggest market for tiger products is China, according to Traffic, . A thriving black market openly persists, with tiger skins and bone being sold for hundreds of dollars in China, Taiwan and Korea. The bone is used as a remedy for everything from ulcers to typhoid. And tiger bone ground into a wine - costing upwards of $120 - is an increasingly popular high-status symbol. &quot;People might give a bottle of tiger bone wine to their boss to encourage a promotion, and it&apos;s used to sweeten business deals,&quot; says Sabri Zain of Traffic, who&apos;s been investigating ways of reducing demand for tiger parts. &quot;Public education doesn&apos;t work,&quot; he says. &quot;You can put up billboards of slaughtered tigers, but it won&apos;t stop people buying tiger wine - we&apos;ve seen that.&quot; Instead, Zain says his group is formalising a plan to work with a few corporate leaders who they hope will come out and openly denounce tiger wine. &quot;We need to make it undesirable - socially unacceptable to drink tiger wine or do business deals with others who give or receive the wine. And we need to provide high-status, tiger-free alternatives.&quot; Zain says that the existence of tiger farms helps foster the idea of the animals as commercial products. And with the private owners of these expensive operations campaigning to be allowed to sell tiger parts, he worries that demand will only increase. &quot;China has a 1.3 billion population, which is getting richer. If only a small percent of those desire tiger parts, the increase in poaching to satisfy them has a huge impact on just 3000 tigers,&quot; Zain says. Separately at this week&apos;s Cites meeting, the World Bank pledged a $100,000 fund to look into the impact of tiger farms on poaching."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jul/27/world-hepatitis-day-silent-disease-response", "publicationDate": "2012-07-27T09:39:43Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Hepatitis B", "Hepatitis C", "Health", "Society", "Infectious diseases", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["Even in countries such as Taiwan and Australia where hepatitis is recognised as a priority health issue, a sizeable proportion of people are yet to be diagnosed.", "This work is under way, with assessment of the policy in Taiwan, a needs assessment of people with chronic viral hepatitis across five locations in China, and support for the facilitation of partnership development initiatives in Malaysia and India.", "\u2022 Professor Ding-Shinn Chen is a distinguished chair professor at the department of internal medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University and is chair of Cevhap."], "title": "World Hepatitis Day: the silent disease needs a global response | Ding-Shinn Chen and Jack Wallace", "article": "The silent nature of viral hepatitis infection has an enormous impact on the capacity and willingness of governments across the world to develop and implement effective policy and health responses to these diseases. The burden of viral hepatitis is stark, particularly in Asia Pacific where the prevalence is greatest, with approximately 340 million people living with chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C. This is almost eight times the number of people in the region infected with HIV, tuberculosis (TB) or malaria (42 million). In 2011, the World Health Organisation&apos;s (WHO) south-east Asia office reported there are 120,000 deaths annually related to hepatitis C and 300,000 related to hepatitis B. Viral hepatitis is a significant health problem, but its silent nature \u2013 there are no symptoms in the early phases, so people are often unaware that they are infected with hepatitis B and C until it is too late \u2013 has meant that the diseases have not had the same global and regional response as HIV, TB and malaria, and this lack of co-ordination continues to undermine global health efforts. In 2010, there were signs that things were changing, with the agreement of a resolution on viral hepatitis by the World Health Assembly, but its implementation to date has been slow and unco-ordinated. Ahead of World Hepatitis Day on Saturday, this week&apos;s publication of a global framework by WHO is another important milestone, but it runs the risk of failing to deliver if the denial that exists around chronic hepatitis, among individuals and in health systems, is not addressed. Hepatitis B, which is transmitted from mother to child or through bodily fluids, is prevented with a safe and effective vaccine. There has been some recent good news from China, which successfully reduced the number of children under five with hepatitis B from 5.5% in 1992 to less than 1% in 2005, according to WHO. But there remain huge barriers for implementing vaccination programmes among babies and young people in the region. Although there is access to vaccines, the implementation can be problematic where there are fundamental weaknesses in health systems. In countries such as Papua New Guinea or Laos there are simply not the health services nor workers available to carry out vaccinations. For most people with viral hepatitis, the infection has no obvious symptoms, meaning that their disease is likely to progress to a point where treatment has limited impact. Most people with viral hepatitis do not know they are infected. Even in countries such as Taiwan and Australia where hepatitis is recognised as a priority health issue, a sizeable proportion of people are yet to be diagnosed. There are systemic barriers to testing in many countries in the region such as Vietnam, Singapore, Philippines, or Thailand where people are required to pay for testing. This essentially limits the number of people who know they are infected and the ability to reduce the impact of infection. Hepatitis B infection is complex, and liver damage as a result of the infection occurs over many years. Most people with chronic hepatitis B will not require treatment, but will need to be monitored to identify when liver damage is taking place. Only about 15-25% of people need to receive treatment for the infection. However, for people who do know that they have the infection, access to health services can be an issue. Of the 300,000 to 400,000 people living with chronic hepatitis B in Hong Kong, 80,000-90,000 people (25%) need treatment, and only half are being treated Like many 21st-century health issues, viral hepatitis knows no borders. Migration and other movements of people mean that comprehensive and co-ordinated responses to the infection within and across countries are imperative if the burden of infection is to be reduced or eliminated. In collaboration with the Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society at La Trobe University, the Coalition for the Eradication of Viral Hepatitis in Asia Pacific (Cevhap) has developed a research plan to assist countries and the World Health Assembly to identify the essential elements of a strategic response to chronic viral hepatitis. This work is under way, with assessment of the policy in Taiwan, a needs assessment of people with chronic viral hepatitis across five locations in China, and support for the facilitation of partnership development initiatives in Malaysia and India. Lessons from other international health issues such as HIV can support the development of effective policy and health responses to viral hepatitis. One lesson is the importance of broad-based partnerships in policymaking, something that has been woefully lacking in Asia. More important, however, is the need for WHO to establish a sustainable mechanism for international funding and implementation of the new global framework and the newly formed Global Hepatitis Programme, similar to those that exist for HIV, TB and malaria. An effective policy framework can prevent new infections, ensure people can access clinical care, and reduce the burden of infection at an individual, country and regional level. That will only be possible if funding is increased considerably. The global response provided by UNAids, the Stop TB Partnership and the Rollback Malaria Partnership show what can be achieved if governments, the medical community, donor organisations and civil society work together. Viral hepatitis can be eliminated with resources, co-ordination and willingness, but, as the world recognises the second WHO-endorsed World Hepatitis Day, a lack of funding remains the single greatest barrier to tackling these diseases. \u2022 Professor Ding-Shinn Chen is a distinguished chair professor at the department of internal medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University and is chair of Cevhap.

Third will play 62nd: Oh Jin-hyek, the third member of team South Korea, against Axel Muller, a lone Swiss. The straightforward statistic is that South Korea are very good at long-form archery, and even if the men have a habit of not doing so well in the individual knockout shorter form \u2013 the winners of the past two Olympics have been Marco Galiazzo of Italy and Viktor Ruban of Ukraine, and both are here \u2013 the best advice is to shoot well enough to avoid them for as long as possible. Larry Godfrey of Bristol did just that, finishing 4th and winning the not inconsiderable accolade of continuing as the topmost non-Korean. He will face Mohammed Emdadul Haque Milon of Bangladesh in the first round of the individual event on Monday. But there is an extension to the simple sums, a tally of the individual totals to give a team ranking. And here Britain ran into a bit of trouble. South Korea are the reigning Olympic and world team champions and avoidance of them in this competition is even more strongly advised. Im, Kim and Oh are a bit short on letters, but go big on numbers, their combined 2,088 being fully 66 points ahead of second-placed France. Now, the top four countries from the ranking round have a first-round bye in the team competition. Simon Terry, a double bronze medallist as far back as Barcelona in 1992, and Alan Wills shot 654 and 660 respectively to leave Britain ranked eighth out of 12, pitching them against ninth-ranked Ukraine. The winners then play South Korea in the quarter finals. The sums were expensive for the British. South Korea&apos;s domination of the women&apos;s ranking round was not quite as complete as the men&apos;s, despite their Olympic record being even more emphatic. Korean women have won the last six team gold medals, but Tan Ya-ting of Taiwan managed to finish on 671pts, level with Ki Bo-bae and Lee Sung-jin. Fewer 10s placed her third. The world No1 woman in the individual event is Deepika Kumari of India. She finished the day here in eighth place, high enough to confirm her as a threat. Quite what Korea will say of their third archer, Choi Hyun-joo, is probably not for family hearing. She slipped out of the top 10, and slid even further into that darkest of places for Koreans: out of the top 20. The hit single that flopped, she finished in 21st position. That was still 21 places higher than Britain&apos;s best woman, Naomi Folkard. Alison Williamson was 47th and Amy Oliver 57th and the team were ranked 11th out of 12, leaving them with an opening match in Sunday&apos;s team competition against Russia. The ranking round is only a sifting process, but confidence in this strange world of muscular motionlessness is more important than physical wellbeing, as the blurred-of-vision Im may prove. Britain had an unhappy Olympics in Beijing at the archery and have worked hard on team-building and powers of concentration. To start shakily in a sport that abhors a tremor is not encouraging and suggests that the odds, those sums of probability, are stacked against five of the six. Godfrey, fourth at the 2004 Athens Olympics in the individual, is the lone hope so far. The one and only \u2013 no simpler figure than that."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/27/london-2012-idiot-games-leaders", "publicationDate": "2012-07-27T19:00:00Z", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "London", "Sport", "World news", "UK news", "Mitt Romney", "Jeremy Hunt", "Politics", "Olympic Games"], "sentences": ["The Taiwanese are also annoyed, because China made the terrified Regent Street Happy Flag Depository take down the Taiwanese flag, possibly because Hamleys can&apos;t afford to lose the Chinese embassy account (Flag Wars \u2013 Heat 2)."], "title": "London 2012: welcome to the Idiot Games, where our leaders do battle | Tanya Gold", "article": "Tomorrow sees the anti-Olympic protest, which is in London&apos;s Mile End Park and includes deputations from cross citizens, who are presumed to wear small knitted hats and to hate everything, especially stick-throwing and joy. (Do come along.) Unless, of course, as conspiracy theorists contend, the protest will be annihilated by teenage G4S storm-troopers carrying microwave weapons. (Perhaps G4S are more of a danger to themselves?) We have heard complaints about cleaners living in box rooms, and evil sponsors, and we have learned what a militarist dictatorship feels like \u2013 it feels like an airport. Now we are in the patriotic backwash, as journalists watch people doing the same thing at the same time and attempt to analyse it, which is futile because it is so simple. The Olympic Games is a Mexican wave, and if a wave feels like unity, then so does any act that everyone can engage in, including death. It feels almost too late to say that many communal endeavours excite me, but men throwing sticks do not. Boo, you say. But I write for those who see the Olympics as a giant sports day that has screamed unasked out of the unconscious, with additional economic repercussions, and who would probably enjoy it more if there had been less hypocrisy. I cannot conclude my anti-Olympic sentiments without mentioning Atos, sponsors of the Paralympics, and the company responsible for testing, or rather removing, disability living allowance. I will only say that if the Olympic mascots, two one-eyed drips of steel called Wenlock and Mandeville, applied\u00a0to Atos for disability living allowance, which is surely the inalienable right of all cyclops, they probably wouldn&apos;t get\u00a0it. Now it is here, the only sensible course is to treat the Games as a fascinating anthropological experiment, as people who would normally avoid London arrive to participate in the &quot;Stupid Olympics&quot;. The most fun so far was watching Mitt Romney, whose name translated into German is almost, but not quite, &quot;With Stupid&quot;, call Ed Miliband &quot;Mr Leader&quot;. This is all good, but it is not worth \u00a39bn and it is not a legacy unless Mr Leader adopts Mr Leader as his full-time nickname, which I hope he does. Almost as fun was the North Korean meltdown over the wrong flag flying at the football \u2013 Flag Wars (Heat 1). I hoped that the North Koreans had better things to worry about, including the possible existence of a new first lady, or Comrade Wife, called Ri Sol-ju, but they do not. The Taiwanese are also annoyed, because China made the terrified Regent Street Happy Flag Depository take down the Taiwanese flag, possibly because Hamleys can&apos;t afford to lose the Chinese embassy account (Flag Wars \u2013 Heat 2). This is all Playmobil diplomacy, and it is almost as wonderful as watching the Eurovision song contest morph into a metaphor for no one being over the Franco-Prussian war, as it always does. The possibilities for chaos were symbolised when the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, attempted to ring a bell today; it fell apart, made a woman scream and the scene is now available on YouTube with a disco mix. When asked about Hunt&apos;s &quot;mishap with the bell end&quot;, the mayor of London said he was &quot;head down doing other things&quot;. Then there is the arrival in London of heads of state who were told they could not travel to the opening ceremony in a crocodile of rival limousines (Limo Wars), but had to congregate at Buckingham Palace and get on a bus: the world&apos;s wackiest school trip. It even had monitors. To have so many tyrants collected together that they have to travel in a pack is hardly democratic, but watching them likewise tyrannised is gratifying. The new Serbian president, Tomislav Nikolic, said in advance he would definitely not shake hands with, and so presumably did not sit next to, Kosovo&apos;s prime minister, Hashim Tha\u00e7i, and hopefully there were other fights. Who sat at the front with the Queen and who sat at the back and threw Rice Krispies at Michelle Obama? As I write we don&apos;t know, but it is all fascinating. What of the athletes? I think they are ill-served by the coverage so far, which is segueing, inevitably, into drooling. There have been disgusting articles about the sex lives of swimmers, and the gay dating app (OK, dating is a euphemism) Grindr had to deny that it crashed for 24 hours on Monday because the athletes arrived at their fortified village and fell on top of each other. This prurience will doubtless ebb as the athletes start throwing sticks, but the International Olympic Committee didn&apos;t help by announcing that it will not spot-check competitors&apos; underwear for unauthorised logos (Logo Wars), although if they drop their shorts they may be dragged into a room by G4S stormtroopers and a representative of the Daily Mail, or at least fined. It goes on. Paul Allen&apos;s Octopus, a yacht so huge it makes the other yachts self-harm, is in West India Dock; the German ship Deutschland, here to host the German Olympic Committee, but which I am now calling the German Sex Boat, is nearby. Around these monsters, in the Bus Lanes of Despair, and in the voices of our leaders, you will watch the\u00a0real Games.

It&apos;s an exhibitionist&apos;s bicycle, an I&apos;m-mad-me steed. A ludicrous contraption so wilfully wacky you may as well go the whole hog and pedal around with &quot;You don&apos;t have to be crazy to ride this bike, but it helps!&quot; embossed on your helmet. &quot;Why are you riding a triangle?&quot; I&apos;m sure that&apos;s what everyone was thinking. If I caught them checking out my wheels, I reddened, desperate to tell them this wasn&apos;t my bike. I hadn&apos;t paid \u00a3500 for this silly contraption. I&apos;m not like that. One question recurred: what&apos;s the point? I struggled to find one. Sure, I was able to appreciate the oil-free Kevlar belt, which replaces a normal chain \u2013 every commuter bike should have one. I had respect for the super-reactive disc brakes and I could see how the meerkat-ish riding position would be handy for a bad back and a good view of the road. But why bother with a folding bike that, even when compact, was the size of a set of golf clubs. So I asked the inventor. Mark Sanders came up with the Strida for his final project 25 years ago at Imperial College and the Royal College of Art but has long since sold the company. &quot;Maybe you just don&apos;t like it?&quot; he said in a very cheery email. &quot;It is a radical bicycle :-) Don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s a &apos;Marmite product&apos; \u2013 people seem to love it or hate it. It is not a bland, me-too product.&quot; It has &quot;chutzpah&quot;, he added. He admitted that, in the UK, the homegrown Brompton is &quot;the folding bike&quot;. But, he said, &quot;in Asia, where it is now made [Taiwan], this is reversed \u2013 Strida is seen as contemporary and less agricultural than most folding bikes. Even in countries like Russia and China they sell many more Stridas than [in the] UK. There are even several fake Strida factories in China \u2013 government-sponsored... grrrrrrr!!&quot; I confessed I had problems with the feathery steering, which Sanders described as &quot;super-manoeuvrable&quot; but just made me feel vulnerable. The unusual fold, inspired by the classic Maclaren pushchair, has its own advantages, Sanders insists. The idea is for the bike to convert quickly into a &quot;stick-with-wheels&quot; that fits neatly in corners. He insists you can stuff it in a golf bag and get it on a plane \u2013 I was planning to take it to the car-free Channel Island of Sark, but once I&apos;d struggled handling the thing on London&apos;s flat tarmac, I decided against trialling it on Sark&apos;s up-and-down dirt tracks. The single gear would have been fine \u2013 I actually found it too low for most of my cycling around the plains of north London \u2013 but I didn&apos;t trust myself to stay in the saddle.

On a summer day, it winds past rows of sunflowers, their upturned heads swaying hypnotically in the light breeze, past neat regiments of maize and uphill along the narrow route with its galleries hewn from the rock. You can see Saint-Cirq-Lapopie, on its austere stony outcrop, long before you can reach it. Rising from a sheer bluff at least 100 metres high, the village has taunted and repelled invaders for centuries. &quot;We&apos;re a bit off the beaten track,&quot; laughs Virginie Seguin, the local tourist office director. &quot;As you can see, you have to want to come to Saint-Cirq-Lapopie to get here.&quot; In the Middle Ages, it saw off warring seigneurs, religious fanatics and the English with its formidable defences. Today, however, Saint-Cirq-Lapopie has a new battle to wage. Since it was crowned France&apos;s favourite village in a vote of television viewers in June, the hamlet of only 217 inhabitants, 30km east of Cahors, has been besieged by tourists. Even before TV stardom beckoned, Saint-Cirq-Lapopie was on the &quot;must-see&quot; map, with about 400,000 visitors every summer, the vast majority of them French. Now the locals are braced for hundreds of thousands more. The remains of the ancient gates at either end of the village, named after the child martyr Saint Cyr, and La Popie, one of the feudal dynasties that ruled in the Middle Ages, stop nobody these days. Closed, they had rendered the village almost impenetrable, as Richard the Lionheart discovered when he laid siege to Saint-Cirq without success in 1199. During the hundred years war in the 14th and 15th centuries, the village changed hands often, leading to one hidden entrance being named La Porte des Anglais. Later still, the village was on the frontline of the 16th-century French religious wars between Protestant Huguenots and Roman Catholics. After the second world war it became a haven for French surrealists when Andr\u00e9 Breton, the movement&apos;s founder, bought a house here and established the village as a haven for artists. Breton wrote in 1951: &quot;Saint-Cirq-Lapopie has cast a single enchantment over me. One that has fixed me for ever. I no longer wish to be anywhere else.&quot; Today, Saint-Cirq still has its art galleries and its old magic. The imposing gothic church with its panoramic view far over the Lot Valley is flanked by the ruins of several ancient chateaux that lord it over a village packed with history, including 13 classified buildings. Peering down, the clusters of stone houses with their arrow-sharp, flat-tiled roofs cling to the rock and each other. Some are built on passages so steep their roof ends where their neighbour&apos;s garden begins. There is surprisingly little 21st-century urban clutter: electricity cables and telephone wires have been hidden under the eaves and cobbles, television antennae banished to lofts; there are no satellite dishes, advertising hoardings or neon lights. The cars, coaches and caravans winding their way to the rocky escarpment are diverted to one of six car parks a short walk \u2013 or shuttle ride \u2013 away. Last week, the small tourist office that is modern-day Saint-Cirq&apos;s first line of defence was under siege. &quot;The sudden increase in visitors has taken us a bit by surprise \u2026 not that I&apos;m complaining,&quot; said Clare, who broke off from photocopying her last remaining village map to ring medics on behalf of a tourist who had sprained an ankle on the climb over stones polished by centuries of feet. The restaurants were full and a queue snaked out of the ice-cream shop into the hot sun. Sophie Darrieux, who runs the It&apos;s So gift shop down one of Saint-Cirq-Lapopie&apos;s lower streets, was delighted. &quot;As a businesswoman, the more people the better,&quot; she said. &quot;In any case, with tourism it&apos;s all or nothing. Either visitors come or the village is dead.&quot; Patrick Vinel, 56, is the fifth generation of his family to live and work in the village. A &quot;Saint-Cirqouis de souche [born and bred]&quot;, as they say. He is also the village&apos;s last remaining woodturner. Once there were more than 100 engaged in the production of wooden taps for wine barrels. Today, Vinel produces gifts, toys and souvenirs. &quot;Why would I complain? I live thanks to the tourists. I&apos;m not going to spit in the soup by moaning,&quot; Vinel said, sitting in his workshop near an old belt-and-pedal lathe. He pointed to photographs of Saint-Cirq covered in snow and deserted. Asked what he does in winter when the tourists have gone, he looks up from his workbench as if addressing the village idiot. &quot;What do I do? I work of course. I replenish the stock. This stuff doesn&apos;t come from Taiwan, you know. It&apos;s all made by hand.&quot; Swedish born Kristina Jacobsson, 48, vice-president of the Friends of Saint-Cirq-Lapopie, who runs the Lou Bolat restaurant, said she understood villagers who said enough was enough, but admitted she was &quot;delighted&quot; by the legions of tourists. The mayor, Gilles Hardeveld, agreed it was &quot;good news&quot;, but admitted it was crucial the village kept its authenticity. He said: &quot;We don&apos;t want to become a tourist supermarket so we&apos;re doing our best to make sure that doesn&apos;t happen.&quot; Sitting in his office at the mairie, Hardeveld outlined his plan of defence: persuading tourists to come throughout the year and not just in summer. &quot;Of course, there are some local people who complain about the tourists,&quot; he said. &quot;But there are villages around us who have nothing, not even in summer, so we have to admit we are very lucky.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/29/internet-addiction-hooked-digital-technology", "publicationDate": "2012-07-28T23:03:03Z", "tags": ["Internet", "Mental health", "Technology", "Smartphones", "Tablet computers", "Digital media", "Computing", "Health", "Facebook", "Social networking", "Society", "Silicon Valley"], "sentences": ["In China, Taiwan and Korea, internet addiction is accepted as a genuine psychiatric problem with dedicated treatment centres for teenagers who are considered to have serious problems with their web use."], "title": "Internet addiction even worries Silicon Valley", "article": "The latest trend on the internet is to step away from the internet, according to a growing band of American technology leaders and psychologists for whom the notion of the addictive power of digital gadgets is gaining sway. Although the idea of a clinical disorder of internet addiction was first mooted in the 90s and is now regularly treated by doctors on both sides of the Atlantic, attention is shifting from compulsive surfing to the effects of the all-pervasive demands that our phones, laptops, tablets and computers are making on us. In China, Taiwan and Korea, internet addiction is accepted as a genuine psychiatric problem with dedicated treatment centres for teenagers who are considered to have serious problems with their web use. Next year, America&apos;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the authority on mental illness, could include &quot;internet use disorder&quot; in its official listings. In February, leaders of the largest social media companies will gather in San Francisco for the Wisdom 2.0 conference. The theme for the \\conference, attended by some of Silicon Valley&apos;s biggest names, is finding balance in the digital age. Richard Fernandez, Google&apos;s development director, has called it &quot;quite possibly the most important gathering of our times&quot;. Fernandez plays a key role in Google&apos;s &quot;mindfulness&quot; movement. Aimed at teaching employees the risks of becoming overly engaged with their devices and to improve their concentration levels and ability to focus, he says teaching people to occasionally disconnect is vital. &quot;Consumers need to have an internal compass where they&apos;re able to balance the capabilities that technology offers them for work with the qualities of the lives they live offline,&quot; he says. Newsweek recently held up the case of Jason Russell, the film-maker behind the Kony 2012 video. Russell&apos;s film went viral, bringing him fame as 70 million people watched it. After spending days online with little sleep, Russell had a psychotic breakdown \u2013 all digitally documented via social media on his Twitter and YouTube accounts. His wife said he had been diagnosed as having &quot;reactive psychosis&quot;, which doctors had linked to his extreme internet exposure. It was an illustration, said Newsweek writer Tony Dokoupil, of the proof that was &quot;starting to pile up&quot; that the web was making us more depressed, anxious and prone to attention deficit disorders than ever before. &quot;The first good peer-reviewed research is emerging and the picture is much gloomier than the trumpet blasts of web utopians have allowed,&quot; said Dokoupil. Psychologists are deeply worried about the effects digital relationships are having on real ones. Facebook is working on plans to curb anonymous &quot;stalking&quot; by allowing users to see who has visited any group of which they are a member \u2013 with the possibility in future of extending that to allow people to see who has looked at their page. &quot;Checking Facebook to see what the ex is doing becomes a drug,&quot; according to psychologist Seth Meyers, who said the checking could quickly decline into obsessive-compulsive behaviour. Stuart Crabb, a director at Facebook, said people needed to be aware of the effect that time online has on relationships and performance. However, some doubt the notion of technology addiction, pointing instead to the rising demands of the workplace, where employees are working longer hours and then going home still tethered to devices pinging them emails and messages. &quot;Are we addicted to gadgets or indentured to work?&quot; asks Alexis Madrigal, a writer for the Atlantic. &quot;Much of our compulsive connectedness\u2026 is a symptom of a greater problem, not the problem itself.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/29/mitt-romney-bad-trip-editorial", "publicationDate": "2012-07-29T21:47:07Z", "tags": ["Mitt Romney", "US foreign policy", "World news", "Republicans", "US news", "US politics"], "sentences": ["Would he confront China on currency, trade and the South China Sea, perhaps adding fuel to the fire by supplying Taiwan with new weapons?"], "title": "Mitt Romney: bad trip | Editorial", "article": "Mitt Romney&apos;s foray abroad is very much an extension of his campaign at home. He wants to demonstrate to Americans that he is respected in the world and, by his choice of destinations, to underline what he regards as bull points in his foreign policy. In Britain, he intended to imply that President Obama \u2013 the man who removed the bust of Winston Churchill from the White House and who called the Falklands the Malvinas \u2013 has neglected or damaged the special relationship. He may also have seen the British leg of his trip as useful to him in burnishing his credentials as a successful organiser of a previous Olympics \u2013 the Salt Lake City winter games in 2002. Poland, later this week, will give him a chance to stand on what he regards as the front line against Russia, which he has famously called &quot;the number one geopolitical foe of the United States&quot;. In Israel, with the curiously ambiguous formulation that he would &quot;respect&quot; an Israeli decision to attack Iran, he has sailed close to the wind in trying to demonstrate that America under his presidency would once again be the staunchest of allies. Romney&apos;s words abroad are really aimed at Americans at home, but the trip nevertheless prompts consideration of what kind of president he would be for the world. One with a capacity to say, or do, the wrong thing in terms of etiquette is what his performance in London suggests. And, even before he got to Israel, his planners had already mismanaged things there by proposing to hold a fundraising event on a solemn fast day. They have now switched the timing of that event. So the style is a bit ragged; what of the substance? Romney is such a slippery character that it is hard to know which of his announced foreign policies, if any, would actually be put into practice were he to become president. Would he deliberately provoke Vladimir Putin, a leader who, apart from being naturally bellicose, thinks that standing up to the United States helps maintain his popularity at home? And would he carry out his threat to &quot;review&quot; the strategic arms limitation treaty? That would be a deeply counter-productive course, but it is the one that Romney has said he would follow. Would he confront China on currency, trade and the South China Sea, perhaps adding fuel to the fire by supplying Taiwan with new weapons? That would be equally stupid, yet Romney has made statements that indicate he might do so. Would he impose additional sanctions on Iran and take his tough line on Tehran to the point of war, as John Bolton, one of his foreign policy advisers, has come close to saying might be necessary? An attack on Iran would have incalculable consequences, but one thing would be certain: most of them would be bad, or worse than bad. Would he discard Obama&apos;s timetable for troop withdrawals in Afghanistan, as he has said he might do after review, or even insist on keeping troops in Iraq ? That would be to fly in the face of the consensus that it is time both countries made their own way, for good or ill, in the wake of American intervention. Romney&apos;s decision to take his campaign abroad represents a reluctant tribute to Obama, whose tour of foreign capitals in July, 2008, showed Americans that he was a man who could reverse the decline in American prestige and influence under George Bush. After it, Americans could be in no doubt which candidate for their highest office the world overwhelmingly wanted. Romney can hardly expect a similar result. Obama has disappointed his global constituency, but there is a difference between a disappointment and the disaster toward which Romney&apos;s rhetoric points. The constraints of actual power, and the common sense which can still occasionally be glimpsed between the huffing and puffing, may mean that Romney, if he won, might be a tolerable leader. But it is hard to be sure."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/jul/30/london-2012-weightlifting-taiwan", "publicationDate": "2012-07-30T21:49:55Z", "tags": ["Sport", "Olympics 2012: weightlifting", "Weightlifting", "Taiwan", "Olympic Games"], "sentences": ["When Hsu Shu-ching took to the podium to receive her silver medal in the women&apos;s 53kg weightlifting competition, a fairly unusual flag was hoisted to honour her achievement \u2013 not the red, blue and white emblem of her home, Taiwan, but a more complicated design featuring, among other things, the five Olympic rings.", "Still officially the Republic of China, or RoC, Taiwan separated from mainland China in 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s Nationalist forces fled there after their defeat by Mao Zedong&apos;s communists.", "Beijing, by contrast, viewed \u2013 and still views \u2013 Taiwan as an upstart renegade province to be reintegrated, by force if necessary.", "In 1956 Taiwan competed as the RoC, prompting mainland China to withdraw from the International Olympic Committee.", "Taiwan was left in a bind.", "The eventual, somewhat messy, compromise of Chinese Taipei, at first bitterly resisted by the Taiwanese, allows the island separate participation but is sufficiently linguistically ambiguous enough to sound, in Beijing at least, more like a province than a country.", "The formula is now used in everything from football to Taiwan&apos;s International Monetary Fund membership, even Miss World, which sometimes features a Miss Chinese Taipei.", "Such is Taiwan&apos;s wider fate in an era of ever increased Chinese power.", "The island is now recognised as a nation by about two dozen mainly tiny nations, generally in return for Taiwanese aid and investment.", "As Chinese Taipei, Taiwan has had limited Olympic success, mainly in taekwondo \u2013 in 2004 the island won its only two gold medals on the same day in the sport \u2013 and weightlifting, with the occasional foray into archery and table tennis.", "Taiwanese Olympic success is hugely appreciated on the island, even under the name of convenience, said Jacqueline Shen, deputy head of the country&apos;s Olympic committee."], "title": "London 2012: Taiwan compete reluctantly under flag of convenience", "article": "When Hsu Shu-ching took to the podium to receive her silver medal in the women&apos;s 53kg weightlifting competition, a fairly unusual flag was hoisted to honour her achievement \u2013 not the red, blue and white emblem of her home, Taiwan, but a more complicated design featuring, among other things, the five Olympic rings. On Monday her compatriot in the 58kg competition also took to the stage at the ExCeL arena. &quot;Kuo Hsing-chun, Chinese Taipei,&quot; came the announcement over the PA. Such complications are the sporting symptoms of one of the most bitter disputes in modern international relations, in which an effectively independent island state of 23m people is obliged to compete under a made-up name, with a similarly artificial flag and anthem. Still officially the Republic of China, or RoC, Taiwan separated from mainland China in 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s Nationalist forces fled there after their defeat by Mao Zedong&apos;s communists. The RoC name symbolised Chiang&apos;s presumption that his Kuomintang party still represented China&apos;s real government rather than the communists, and would some day return. Beijing, by contrast, viewed \u2013 and still views \u2013 Taiwan as an upstart renegade province to be reintegrated, by force if necessary. The resultant decades of heavily militarised jostling have been played out in microcosm at the Olympics. In 1956 Taiwan competed as the RoC, prompting mainland China to withdraw from the International Olympic Committee. But China&apos;s influence grew and in 1979 the IOC switched recognition to Beijing. Taiwan was left in a bind. The eventual, somewhat messy, compromise of Chinese Taipei, at first bitterly resisted by the Taiwanese, allows the island separate participation but is sufficiently linguistically ambiguous enough to sound, in Beijing at least, more like a province than a country. The formula is now used in everything from football to Taiwan&apos;s International Monetary Fund membership, even Miss World, which sometimes features a Miss Chinese Taipei. Athletes who triumph under the banner even receive their medals to a special tune, officially, and wordily, known as the Anthem of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee. Such is Taiwan&apos;s wider fate in an era of ever increased Chinese power. The island is now recognised as a nation by about two dozen mainly tiny nations, generally in return for Taiwanese aid and investment. Everyone else, even their close ally America, must officially pretend otherwise. As Chinese Taipei, Taiwan has had limited Olympic success, mainly in taekwondo \u2013 in 2004 the island won its only two gold medals on the same day in the sport \u2013 and weightlifting, with the occasional foray into archery and table tennis. In London they are fielding a 32-strong squad, taking in athletics, archery, badminton, table tennis, swimming, weightlifting, fencing, cycling, sailing and taekwondo. Their opening ceremony flag bearer was the men&apos;s 105kg-plus weightlifter Chen Shih-chieh. Taiwanese Olympic success is hugely appreciated on the island, even under the name of convenience, said Jacqueline Shen, deputy head of the country&apos;s Olympic committee. &quot;It means a lot to people, even though it&apos;s not easy for us. In reality we are a separate country. Chinese Taipei is a political term rather than a geographical one. We don&apos;t like it but we can cope with it. &quot;It&apos;s a bit unfair on the athletes. We explain it to them and they understand why we have to use this name and this flag. I&apos;m sure they&apos;d rather see their flag but it&apos;s a political reality.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/31/los-angeles-angels-dodgers-cincinnati-reds-boston-red-sox", "publicationDate": "2012-07-31T13:00:00Z", "tags": ["MLB", "US sports", "Sport", "Boston Red Sox", "Los Angeles Angels", "Cincinnati Reds", "Los Angeles Dodgers"], "sentences": ["Someone looks at this and has been in baseball a while, been in Asia, been in Korea, been in Taiwan, been in Venezuela, it&apos;s the way of the land."], "title": "MLB: five things we learned in week 17", "article": "Snapshot On Friday, with the 31 July non-waiver trade deadline approaching, Zack Greinke was dealt from the Milwaukee Brewers to the Los Angeles Angels for rookie shortstop Jean Segura and Double-A right-handers Ariel Pena and Johnny Hellweg. The acquisition of a proven front of the rotation starter is is confirmation of what most baseball fans already know \u2013 despite a .500 July, the third-place Halos can smell the World Series. Truth be told, after investing all that dough in Albert Pujols and CJ Wilson, the Angels had better make the playoffs and start earning the revenue that comes with post-season baseball. With October baseball on the line, giving up three of the organization&apos;s top-10 prospects for a high-powered rental makes sense for a Los Angeles team in win-now mode. If Greinke, a soon to be free agent, walks away from the Angels after the season, then so be it.  Greinke is a weapon, one that has won in the American League before. In 2009, he found a way to go 16-9 with a 2.16 ERA on a Kansas City team that lost 97 games, accounting for nearly 25% of the Royals&apos; victories. In his Angels debut on Sunday, LA&apos;s bats wasted a sterling effort by Greinke, who allowed just two runs in seven innings, striking out eight Rays batters while walking just one. Tampa won 2-0.  For me, the most interesting thing to come out of the trade of Greinke is a photograph that was taken by former teammate, John Axford. Shortly after news of the trade broke, Axford sent a snapshot out into the world via instagram, showing Greinke surrounded by teammates that are sad to see him go. The caption read: &quot;in the words of Lloyd Christmas, &quot;I hate goodbyes&quot;! #ZackWillBeMissed  The photo offers some insight into the relationships between players who spend an enormous amount of time with each other, the camaraderie of a clubhouse, and of course, the business of baseball. It&apos;s obvious that Greinke&apos;s teammates thought a lot of him, that he meant more to the team than just wins and strikeouts. It&apos;s an authentic, impromptu baseball moment, thankfully shared with all.  All Han-ds on deck The Angels weren&apos;t the only LA team making moves last week. The Dodgers, a team desperate for offense, acquired Hanley Ramirez from sellers Miami on Tuesday. Just four Dodgers, Matt Kemp, Andre Ethier, AJ Ellis and James Loney, were everyday players in LA&apos;s line-up, the remaining positions involved platooning players. With Ramirez made available by the Marlins, Dodgers GM Ned Colletti jumped on the opportunity, dealing Nathan Eovaldi and Scott McGough for reliever Randy Choate and Ramirez.  It&apos;s a gamble for Los Angeles, who are on the hook for over $30m over the next two seasons for a player who has been on a downward spiral since winning the batting title in 2009. At the time of the deal, Ramirez was hitting .246, a shadow of the franchise player he once was, never mind his attitude issues. Colletti was clearly banking on the old change of scenery thing working out, and so far the early returns are positive, hitting a 10th-inning home run at San Francisco on Friday night.  Randy Choate told the Los Angeles Times: &quot;It seemed there were a lot of expectations [in Miami] fell solely on him and a lot of blame fell solely on him. It just seemed the more that we started failing, the more he started getting blamed.&quot; Ramirez said to the Times   &quot;I&apos;m happy, I&apos;m relaxed. My mind is completely clean. \u2026 We got a chance. It&apos;s a different feeling.&quot;  In his first five games the Dodgers have averaged nearly 1.5 more runs per game with Ramirez in the line-up, while the 28-year-old hit for a 1.036 OPS compared with .749 in Miami. Los Angeles swept their three-game series with the hated Giants, to move LA into a tie for first place in the NL West, while panic buttons were pressed in the Pacific Northwest. The San Jose Mercury news sounded the alarm Sunday: &quot;Must make a trade! The Dodgers look invincible with Hanley Ramirez! The Giants MUST respond by getting a big bat NOW NOW NOW!&quot; The clock is ticking on the Giants and the rest of baseball with the deadline for non-waiver trades set to come and go on Tuesday afternoon.  Meanwhile, the White Sox made their big move on Saturday, dealing for inconsistent Twins starting pitcher Francisco Liriano in exchange for infielder Eduardo Escobar and lefty Pedro Hernandez. Depending on which Liriano takes to the hill, the Sox could have a game-changing front of the rotation starter, or the pitcher who is 3-10 with an ERA over 5.00 this season. He&apos;ll face his former team in Minnesota on Tuesday.  Red with envy OK, who had the Reds being able to rip off 10 straight, their longest winning streak of the season, without their franchise slugger Joey Votto? I feel like I&apos;ve been asking a lot of questions like that this year... Anyway, as the old hardball cliche goes, baseball is indeed a funny game, and we should never, ever, ever be surprised or shocked by what it throws at us.  The Reds are hot, scorching hot, and happen to be tearing it up without their one-time MVP in the lineup. So, how do the Reds make up for all that firepower? Like any team called &quot;Reds&quot;, collectively. Heading into Monday, the Reds are 11-3 since Votto landed on the shelf, Brandon Phillips is hitting .372 with two homers and four doubles in the last two weeks, Ryan Ludwick is hitting .417 over the past week, while Drew Stubbs has provided timely hitting and a .950 OPS over the past 14 games, that&apos;s after batting in the low 200&apos;s all season long. Without Votto, Cincinnati have scored more runs per game than they have averaged all season long. How about that?! And while all of this offense is helping fill the gaping hole left by Votto, the 2012 Reds continue to show that they are a team led by its pitching staff. In fact, the Reds have used just five starting pitchers through their first 100 games, something they haven&apos;t done in, say, 114 years, which is a very, very long time. More than just healthy, Cincinnati pitchers are effective, especially as of late. Mike Leake has given up more than two earned runs just once in his previous seven starts, while Bronson Arroyo has lowered his ERA by more than a half run over his past six outings. Meanwhile, Mat Latos, acquired over the winter to provide that young starter bursting with ace potential, has only allowed more than two earned runs just once in his previous six starts. Yes, the Reds starters can throw and their bullpen is deep.  Even if the Pittsburgh Pirates are getting all the attention these days, (and really, why not, being in their first bona fide pennant race in 19 years), Dusty Baker&apos;s first-place Reds, flying well below the radar, are deserving of the three game lead they hold over the Bucs.  You have to laugh... Bobby Valentine said on Saturday &quot;We&apos;ve got drama. We&apos;ve got pre-game drama, we&apos;ve got in-game drama, and we&apos;ve got post-game drama. Man, we&apos;ve got drama.&quot; Some baseball fans think the polarizing Valentine is wrong about everything, but who after watching the goings on in Boston in 2012 could deny the truth in those words? Valentine&apos;s in-game drama this weekend came on Sunday night when he was ejected during Boston&apos;s 3-2 victory over the New York Yankees, one that sealed a series win during their first visit to Yankee Stadium this season. That was the least of the action in and around the Red Sox clubhouse last week.  There were rumors of a deal to trade Carl Crawford to Miami for Jose Reyes, rumblings that made their way through Fenway via the New York Post&apos;s Joel Sherman. Later in the week, an unnamed baseball executive said that Ben Cherington was trying to find a way to get Josh Beckett out of town, a rumor eventually denied by the Sox GM.  Then, after the Yanks pasted Boston 10-3 on Friday&apos;s series opener, Dustin Pedroia sounded off.   &quot;The first 100 games have been [expletive],&quot; Pedroia told reporters. &quot;We&apos;re two games under .500 and we&apos;re the Boston Red Sox. If everyone is thrilled about where we&apos;re at, we need to re-evaluate because I don&apos;t like losing. We need to play better, man.&quot;  There was more:  &quot;Our at bats later in the game were not good,&quot; Pedroia said. &quot;We&apos;re swinging early in the count. Heck, if their eighth-inning guy is going to come into the game, let&apos;s at least get 25-30 pitches, so maybe he can&apos;t pitch tomorrow. Do something productive and we&apos;re not doing that. That&apos;s a sign of not a winning team.&quot;  All this from the Sox second baseman, while Valentine sung a different tune about his cellar-dwelling Sox:   &quot;We&apos;ll turn it around. We haven&apos;t had our big streak yet. That&apos;s the good news.&apos;&apos;  In case that outburst wasn&apos;t enough for Sox fans, Saturday saw Terry Francona make an appearance in his former clubhouse. The ex-Boston manager, who was fired after the team collapsed last September, was visiting Cody Ross, gathering information for his current gig as an ESPN analyst. That one-on-one chat quickly transformed into Francona holding clubhouse court for roughly a half-hour with a host of his former players including Dustin Pedroia, Clay Buchholz, Jarrod Saltalamacchia, Nick Punto and David Ortiz. Valentine and Francona, who sparred in the press earlier this season, would later meet for an informational session as is normal for ESPN broadcasters to do. Francona would later text Valentine to apologize for causing any hubbub.  There was also continued discussion surrounding the documentary film Valentine executive produced called &quot;Ballplayer: Pelotero&quot; which focuses on some of the dodgy dealings that used to take place surrounding the signing of baseball players from Dominican Republic, a process that Major League Baseball has improved over the past couple of years.             The film drew the ire of Bud Selig earlier in July, and the commissioner let Valentine&apos;s employers know of his displeasure. The Sox manager defended the work on Friday.   &quot;They made a good film. Someone looks at this and has been in baseball a while, been in Asia, been in Korea, been in Taiwan, been in Venezuela, it&apos;s the way of the land. You think when I was being signed they didn&apos;t try to tell me some things that weren&apos;t true? Of course.&quot;  Just another odd moment in a season of never ending odd moments.  And despite the wacky week in Beantown, and everything else that has gone down in Back Bay thus far in 2012, rather incredibly, the Sox are just four games out of a wild card spot heading into Monday&apos;s games.  No Olympic baseball in Blighty These were supposed to be banner days for the British Baseball Federation. Had baseball been played at these Olympic Games, it would have meant construction of a bona fide baseball venue in London (not to mention softball), and a Great Britain team playing on an Olympic level, which, at least in theory, could have provided a springboard for the growth of the sport in the UK.  In 2005, two days after the Olympics were awarded to London, both baseball and softball were voted out of the Games, and today, the good people at the BBF are standing outside of their own house without a ticket to the big party in their backyard, a crushing blow to all involved in British baseball, especially considering how close they were to realizing one of their major goals. Josh Chetwynd, former co-host of MLB on Five UK, was playing for GB when the sport was dropped.  &quot;We all knew what a difference this sort of high-profile event could have on interest in the game, and, equally as important \u2013 if not more so \u2013 creating a legacy facility. As cliche as it sounds, there is a &quot;if you build it, they will come&quot; phenomenon with baseball. GB baseball has lagged terribly behind other European countries in terms of infrastructure. This could have started the process of turning things around.&quot; They&apos;re not alone of course, other countries looked forward to playing baseball at the Games as well \u2013 Cuba can&apos;t be too pleased. The International Baseball Federation has joined forces with the International Softball Federation in what will be a joint bid to get back into the IOC fold for 2020.  Meanwhile, Major League Baseball, the MLB Players Association, along with the leagues and players associations of other professional leagues worldwide, have succeeded in bringing their biggest stars to the plate with the World Baseball Classic, a tournament sanctioned by the IBAF, which began in 2006. Perhaps seeking to generate some international news ahead of the Olympics, MLB announced on Wednesday that they had awarded the final of the 2013 to AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco. Games in earlier rounds will take place at the new Marlins ballpark in Miami, Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona and the Salt River Fields in Scottsdale, Arizona. There will be an additional international venue to be determined at a later date.  When the event is played next year, for the first time, it will feature teams that had to qualify, 12 of which are new to the tournament. Great Britain will get its chance to make up for a lost Olympic opportunity when they face Germany, Czech Republic and, believe it or not, Canada, who were forced to qualify after not winning a game in the previous tournament. The winner of the group stage, to be played September 20th to 24th in Regensburg, Germany, will be invited to the WBC next spring. Three other groups of four will also play for the right to participate, including non-traditional baseball countries such as Israel, New Zealand, Thailand, Brazil and the Philippines \u2013 a sign that the sports&apos; global reach is on the rise despite losing its place in the Olympic program."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/01/taiwan-facebook-photographs-leeds-london-shang-ting-peng", "publicationDate": "2012-08-01T06:00:00Z", "tags": ["Taiwan", "Leeds", "London", "Books", "Life and style", "Culture"], "sentences": ["   The Observing Diary duo get Taiwan's TV chat show treatment    I love the quirky, the fresh and the unexpected - things I see, don&apos;t quite understand but know have some weird significance.", "A Facebook page set up three years ago by a couple of Taiwanese lasses to share their UK experiences and fascinations with friends and family has become an internet (and now publishing) phenomenon.", "This is a couple of ordinary people from Taiwan.", "Hundreds of likes turned into thousands and when the page hit around 6,000 the Guardian Northerner&apos;s John Baron wrote a short article about it on Guardian Leeds This got picked up in Taiwan feeding into an internet frenzy and national TV and press coverage.", "As the story spread and the number of likes hit the tens of thousands Taiwanese publishers came calling about a book and a deal was signed for the first ever UK Observing Diary book.", "That&apos;s where the women are now, back in Taiwan promoting the book but before they even got there, or the book was released, it entered the Taiwan equivalent of the Amazon chart at number three, number one in the popular travel category, and a second print run was rushed through.", "Their book tour included interviews with Taiwan&apos;s trendiest magazine for young women (Brand Magazine) and multiple national newspaper, radio and TV seshes.", "Having a mild Leeds obsession I absolutely love the idea of an adopted Leeds lass from Taiwan flogging the Leeds word all over the Far East."], "title": "Taiwanese lass hunts cool in Leeds and exports it all over the world", "article": "   The Observing Diary duo get Taiwan's TV chat show treatment    I love the quirky, the fresh and the unexpected - things I see, don&apos;t quite understand but know have some weird significance. I love this one, it&apos;s so left-field and thoroughly modern, full of those things I don&apos;t quite understand, which is to say: the young, funky and trend setting.  A Facebook page set up three years ago by a couple of Taiwanese lasses to share their UK experiences and fascinations with friends and family has become an internet (and now publishing) phenomenon. Shang Ting Peng and Chia-Wen Liu now have over 117,000 followers on The UK Observing Diary Facebook page, over 10 million hits a month and when I checked out the page a single photo had over 19,000 likes.  Yes, I know some people tweet to millions but this isn&apos;t Justin Bieber; this hasn&apos;t got the mundane, cynical clout of the big business, manipulative, multi-media industry machine behind Lady Gaga. This is a couple of ordinary people from Taiwan.  This is cyber street, one of those organic things set up by smart individuals that hit on something and just kept growing. Hundreds of likes turned into thousands and when the page hit around 6,000 the Guardian Northerner&apos;s John Baron wrote a short article about it on Guardian Leeds This got picked up in Taiwan feeding into an internet frenzy and national TV and press coverage. The page is based around Leeds (Shang Ting Peng) and London (Chia-Wen Liu), photo-centric with brief comments in &apos;traditional Chinese&apos;, Mandarin. A guide to all things lifestyle in the two cities; fashion, food, restaurants, cool people, cool brands, bands, events, tourism, interesting buildings, etc; things that are different in the UK to the Far East but also anything that catches their eye, so a brief post about Louis Le Prince making the world&apos;s first film in Leeds went down a storm.            As the story spread and the number of likes hit the tens of thousands Taiwanese publishers came calling about a book and a deal was signed for the first ever UK Observing Diary book. That&apos;s where the women are now, back in Taiwan promoting the book but before they even got there, or the book was released, it entered the Taiwan equivalent of the Amazon chart at number three, number one in the popular travel category, and a second print run was rushed through. Their book tour included interviews with Taiwan&apos;s trendiest magazine for young women (Brand Magazine) and multiple national newspaper, radio and TV seshes. They are big news. To top it all off, from a fashion point of view, there was an interview and photo shoot with Vogue. Due to demand the book has now also been released into more of the Far East including Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. The book launch, a collaboration between their publisher (Suncolour), the British Council and fashion designer/retailer Cath Kidston, was Taipei&apos;s trendy Eslite Books. The store was full, with people queuing outside to filter through and gets books signed after the presentation which - wait for it - included the Victoria Quarter, Back to Basics, Roundhay Park, the Thackray Medical Museum, the Owl Trail, places to study in Leeds and the cities development and future.     Shang Ting Peng and Chia-Wen Liu signing their book in Taipei. Well done John Baron and Guardian Leeds    The book, written in &apos;traditional Chinese&apos; and so only available online in the UK, reflects the women&apos;s fashion background, picture heavy and with the layout of a cool magazine. Shang Ting studied Fashion Communication at the European Institute of Design in Barcelona. Here she had the good fortune to meet an attractive Leeds lad and now works as Hebe Media&apos;s Head of Fashion and for the last year on the print version of the UK Observing Diary. She blogs about the Observing Diary experience at Leeds Online. The extent of my contemporary fashion knowledge ends at the inside leg measurement of my M&amp;S jogging bottoms - ooh, that and washing kids clothes \u2013sommat about R&apos;n&apos;B and almost Emo rockish music \u2013 but the large fashion element is of the streets, pictures of cool looking individuals snapped in the streets and Indi fashion designers/retailers.  The thing I like about newcomers to Leeds, be they from Runcorn or Peru, they look at our city with new eyes and perhaps the further they have travelled, culturally, the fresher the perspective. Because we walk past things every day, we miss the magic, the beauty submerges into a blur of bricks, the clutter of the familiar. To us fish&apos;n&apos;chips are just fish&apos;n&apos;chips but if you stumbled across them for the first time, at the other side of the world, they&apos;d contain magic.  The everyday is obviously cultural, contains a story. As a result of the Catholics&apos; tradition of eating fish rather than meat on a Friday, one in every five meals bought outside the home on a Friday is from a fish&apos;n&apos;chips shop. The ordinary can also tell us who we are; our traditional northern dish contains fish &apos;cooked the Jewish way&apos;. Leeds is a city built and shaped by incomers and Shang Ting is having a C21st impact. Having a mild Leeds obsession I absolutely love the idea of an adopted Leeds lass from Taiwan flogging the Leeds word all over the Far East. Although this was not her intention, she&apos;s a one woman Leeds marketing machine. It&apos;s also exciting that young people with an eye, a phone, an idea and an internet connection can make such a big splash and, it being what seems to be the only &apos;observing diary&apos; in the world, create a new publishing genre and experience.  What&apos;s next for Shang Ting Peng? Well obviously, she wants to work on her Leeds accent.

In the 100 years or so since recorded music has been widely available, our lives have become suffused by it: we are born and die to music, we eat and shop and travel and make love to music, we work and play to music. Some of our most powerful memories are either of music, or are accompanied by music \u2013 and sometimes, even as listeners, we seem almost to become the music that we hear: &quot;Music heard so deeply that it is not heard at all, but you are the music while the music lasts&quot;, as TS Eliot wrote. Philosophers have been puzzling for millennia over what it is about those organised but apparently meaningless sounds that we find so compelling, joined more recently by anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists and neuroscientists. It&apos;s tempting to think that it might be something physical \u2013 something about the orderly patterns of vibrations \u2013 that gives music its compelling force, and right back to Pythagoras and the idea of a harmonic series, philosophers and scientists have chased this mathematical/acoustical explanation. But consider the vast sonic differences between the music of different cultures, or those within our own culture, and this soon seems pretty implausible. The idea that music might be some kind of universal language \u2013 attractive as it may seem when you see children and adults of all races and nationalities enjoying a concert in the park together \u2013 may run into difficulty when you try to get Gilbert and Sullivan fans to express any enthusiasm for dubstep, or jury members of the Chopin Piano Competition to rate the traditional beiguan music of Taiwan. Rather than searching for the holy grail of a mathematical or acoustical explanation, it seems more fruitful \u2013 and actually much more interesting \u2013 to think about the rich and complex manner in which music is embedded into social functions. This happens in microsocial and macrosocial ways: music can make its appeal at the level of whole nations (national anthems at the Olympics remind us of that) and individuals. This isn&apos;t to give up on the idea of some kind of psychological explanation for the extraordinary power and reach of music \u2013 quite the opposite: but it is a reminder that music&apos;s psychological impact needs to be understood in relation to the constantly evolving cultural context within which we make, consume, contemplate, and are absorbed by music.      Stevie Wonder. Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images    There&apos;s been a lot of writing aimed at a broad audience on this fascinating and complex topic: Oliver Sacks&apos;s Musicophilia, Philip Ball&apos;s The Music Instinct, Dan Levitin&apos;s This is your Brain on Music, Ruth Herbert&apos;s Everyday Music Listening, and the book I co-wrote with Nicola Dibben and Stephanie Pitts, Music and Mind in Everyday Life. In admittedly different ways these books all grapple with what might be called the &quot;level&quot; problem: should we be looking at the brain, or at the structure of musical materials, or at the psychological processes of perception, cognition and emotion, or at music&apos;s possible evolutionary origins, or at its everyday 21st-century social functions as the keys to understanding music&apos;s power and impact on people&apos;s lives?  The easy answer, perhaps, is just to say &quot;all of them&quot; \u2013 and in one sense that&apos;s absolutely right. Since our brains and bodies are central to the experience of music, there must be a role for neuroscience; but since it&apos;s also clear that the brain is dramatically shaped by the environment to which it is exposed, we&apos;re going to need a detailed understanding of the structures and possibilities of that particular micro-environment that is music. And it would be neglectful at best, and possibly plain stupid, to ignore the wider body of research on the psychology of human emotions in trying to understand why music moves us, just as it would be wrongheaded and na\u00efve to think that one could account for the popularity and influence of either Madonna&apos;s or Mozart&apos;s music without thinking very hard about social representation, market economics, and the impact of powerful institutions \u2013 like record companies or opera houses.  The critical matter is to find the appropriate approach for any specific question: I&apos;m pretty convinced that the dramatic impact that music can have on the mobility of people suffering from Parkinson&apos;s disease will be understood in terms of neuroscience and rhythm, and that the explanation will involve the activity of specific brain areas and their sensitivity to the regularity and predictability of external sources of information (like metrical rhythms). I don&apos;t see that the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu&apos;s influential theory of cultural capital, for example, has any obvious contribution to make there. But I&apos;m equally convinced \u2013 contrary to some proponents of the so-called Mozart effect \u2013 that a satisfactory understanding of the impact and persisting fascination with Mozart&apos;s music will not come from looking at patterns of notes in his music or areas of the human brain, and that it&apos;s a phenomenon that demands a far more socially and historically informed approach \u2013 to which the idea of cultural capital might well have something to offer. Perhaps one of the problems is a tendency to tackle these big questions in ways that are too general and abstract. One way to ground them is to look more closely and think more deeply about the music that matters most to each of us at a personal level, and the Guardian is launching a project called Six Songs of Me that helps to pose that question. Readers are invited to submit and share information about the music (and it may be songs or symphonies) in specific categories that has soundtracked their lives, and from this social experiment, some fascinating data should emerge that might help us to think more fruitfully about the &quot;big questions&quot; that lie behind the sounds of our lives. What are some of the significant songs or pieces of music for me? The first music I remember was a collection of French children&apos;s songs that we had at home on 45rpm vinyl records whose tunes and misheard words I used to sing with my sisters. &quot;Ong kerrong kerrow kassay&quot; was one of our favourites \u2013 mostly because it had the sound of breaking glass in it \u2013 and only much later did I realise that those nonsense words were actually &quot;Encore un carreau cass\u00e9&quot; (&quot;Another broken window&apos; \u2013 hence the glass). Coming across those records again recently, I was struck by the beautiful orchestration and harmony of many of the arrangements \u2013 that I must have heard at the time, but to which I had never really listened. Those records were &quot;family&quot;, and the first music that I remember owning was a record of Hole in the Ground, recorded by Bernard Cribbins in 1962. Again it was the sound effects on the record (the drill and shovel sounds) that I remember being fascinated by \u2026             The best live musical experience? There&apos;s something very special about music that you&apos;re involved in as a player, and as a teenage violin player, I was a member of the British Youth Symphony Orchestra for a performance of Mahler&apos;s 5th Symphony. It was a transforming experience \u2013 and I remember years later seething with rage after a performance in the Festival Hall when the person sitting next to me spent what seemed like the whole performance flicking through the programme while I was trying to &quot;be the music&quot;, as Eliot put it. There&apos;s something incredibly powerful about shared musical experiences with other people, and equally there&apos;s something horribly distracting and undermining about hearing music with someone who seems to be deaf to what&apos;s going on. Music is much more than the sound, of course, and another live experience that is firmly lodged in my memory is seeing the German progressive rock group Can in about 1975 \u2013 not only for their amazing and unearthly music, but also for the sight of Holger Czukay coolly playing his bass in white gloves. Whatever their other virtues, Can were not a band that would fill the dancefloor, but a song from about the same time that reliably did, and which I loved to dance to, was Stevie Wonder&apos;s Superstition \u2013 that loose mobility and combination of relaxation with completely coordinated precision that engages the body in an utterly compelling manner. As for songs of love and death: well, I have to admit to a serious weakness for late Romantic harmony, so it&apos;s hard to avoid the Liebestod from Wagner&apos;s Tristan and Isolde. Two specific experiences connected with the Liebestod have stayed with me: the first was when the inspiring and eccentric French teacher at school (who told us about Chomsky, as well as \u00eatre and avoir) invited a group of pupils to his house to listen, and talk about, &quot;the erotic in music&quot; \u2013 and played us Kirsten Flagstad singing the Liebestod on an old 78rpm disc, an event that I don&apos;t think I really understood at the time, but which definitely left its mark. Then in the 1980s going to the Coliseum in London to a production of Tristan and Isolde conducted by Reginald Goodall at which I was so engrossed that I recall wishing that there weren&apos;t any intervals.  Definitely not music that you&apos;d want at a funeral, though, where collective and participatory music is the most powerful, and the most helpful. As a secular humanist, I&apos;d paradoxically be very happy with any one of a number of bittersweet hymns. Their power, for me, comes from having sung them at school, where they drew me in musically and emotionally \u2013 despite myself.  So what do the soundtracks to my life tell me about either music or myself? Well, they bring home that strange combination of serendipity and revelation that so often characterises our encounters with music: those BBC advertisements for the proms in which a passerby steps into an invisible circle of sound and is suddenly transfixed and transported tap into a particular preoccupation with &quot;the secret power of music&quot; which is both profoundly ideological and all too real.  There&apos;s nothing secret about music&apos;s power in our lives, even if we are still a long way from having a proper understanding of it, but there is something astonishing and transformative about music&apos;s grip on consciousness \u2013 and the sheer variety of musics, from every age and every part of the globe that can do that. And perhaps our early experiences of music leave a mark that we only understand much later: at the age of 50 I wrote a book called Ways of Listening whose central premise was the continuity between music and the sounds of the everyday environment. Perhaps it&apos;s all down to the influence of those sound effects on the first records that I heard\u2026 \u2022 To join in the Guardian&apos;s Six Songs of Me project, go to guardian.co.uk/sixsongs "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/aug/03/yaeyama-islands-japan-iriomote-ishigaki", "publicationDate": "2012-08-03T21:45:02Z", "tags": ["Japan holidays", "Asia", "Japanese food and drink", "Diving holidays", "Beach holidays", "Tokyo holidays", "Travel"], "sentences": ["Iriomote is the biggest, but least densely populated, of Japan&apos;s Yaeyama islands, about 1,200 miles south-west of Tokyo, and much closer to Taiwan than the Japanese mainland."], "title": "Japan's tropics: the Yaeyama islands", "article": "Smartphones are wonderful things. After a simple lunch at the only restaurant in the tiny village \u2013 fried rice, and miso soup with fish and vegetables \u2013 we trotted out one of our few Japanese phrases. &quot;Gochi so sama deshita.&quot; (Thank you, that was a feast.) The cook beamed and said something to our guide. His English was not much better than our Japanese, but technology came to our aid. Tapping his phone he showed us on screen the translation of the cook&apos;s words: &quot;Did you like it?&quot; To smiles all round, we managed unaided a one-word reply: hai (yes). Such minimal communication felt very special: this was the wildest corner of the wildest island in Japan, Iriomote. Why would anyone speak English? The pearl-farming village of Funauki is home to about 50 people, and reached by ferry across a bay from the small port of Shirahama, where the island&apos;s only road runs out. The boat trip takes about 15 minutes but to walk around the bay would, we&apos;re told, take three days of hacking through jungle. This place would probably be worth a three-day hike, though. Iriomote is the biggest, but least densely populated, of Japan&apos;s Yaeyama islands, about 1,200 miles south-west of Tokyo, and much closer to Taiwan than the Japanese mainland. Much of the island is national park, and covered in jungle and mangrove swamps. The western peninsula, on which Funauki sits, is ringed with white-sand beaches, like a scalloped necklace. The closest, Ida, is about a 10-minute walk along a jungle path from the village: dense trees running right down to a perfect coral-strewn shore and clear warm sea. But this was just nibbling at the edges: on our second day on Iriomote, tour operator Inside Japan Tours, which has launched holidays to the region, had arranged something more adventurous for my husband and me. Climbing into one-man kayaks at Funaura Bay, where two broad brown rivers empty into a wide delta, we headed inland. We were aiming for the 55m-high Pinaisara waterfall, the highest in the region, but our eyes were initially fixed on what was closer to hand: mangroves on leggy stilt roots above ground teeming with fiddler crabs, waving their oversized right claws, hermit crabs of all sizes and thousands of mudskippers \u2013 little fish that can walk on land and breathe air. Though it felt intrepid, kayaking on the rising tide in warm sunshine was easy and peaceful, and soon we were tying up at the base of the waterfall for a dip. Pinaisara means white beard: the falls are supposed to look like the long whiskers of an old man. Climbing to its top was more of a challenge, the narrow path so steep in one place that we had to haul ourselves up on a knotted rope.     Liz Boulter kayaking at Funaura Bay. Photograph: Rachelle Rimmer    Our guide, Nao, had promised lunch at the top. We gazed down at the vertiginous drop of white water, and then out at the jungle, the ribbon of river we had kayaked along, the beach, the ocean and a couple of white-rimmed islands in the distance, and meanwhile Nao did a Mary Poppins act with his rucksack. Out came a camping stove and gas bottle, a little folding windshield, pans, water, bowls, chopsticks and food in packets and boxes. His hot noodle soup with pork, spring onions and pickled ginger may not have been the most elaborate meal we had in Japan, but it was the most welcome. For dessert he produced &quot;lollipops&quot; of super-chilled pineapples on sticks. The delicious local pineapples are the size of a large apple: grown on patches of cultivated land by the coast, they stick up from their bushes like toilet brushes. Iriomote&apos;s coast is glorious, with dark green cliffs and headlands plunging to blue seas, but its few small settlements are very different. We were surprised to find buildings of solid grey concrete, a youth hostel that looked like a detention centre, and a similarly depressing feel at the island&apos;s onsen, or hot spring, the most southerly in Japan \u2013 though apparently inside it is lovely. There are two reasons for this style of building: typhoons and diving. From June to September, the islands are regularly hit by tropical cyclones blowing up from the Philippines. Sturdiness, in building design, wins out over aesthetics. And until recently, the few tourists in Iriomote tended to be scuba divers \u2013 passionate about undersea worlds, less so about where they lay their heads. But that is changing: Hoshino Resort Nirakanai is the island&apos;s first luxury hotel, a Bali-esque retreat with 141 rooms, pool, spa and other facilities. We were more taken with our billet, the 15-room Eco Village. My Guardianista ears pricked up at the word eco, but there&apos;s nothing particularly green about this hotel \u2013 it claims the monicker because it is &quot;immersed in nature&quot;, on a deserted beach 40 minutes&apos; drive from the main port. While husband tested the wicker lounger on our wide veranda, I wandered through unfenced lawns past the pool to the sea, picking up bits of broken coral from the sand, watched by crows and a family of goats. The restaurant at Eco Village is particularly fine: each dinner was a stunning array of dishes, some delightfully moreish, such as pork with black sesame and island vegetables; others were just strange, such as raw pig&apos;s ear (like chewing rubber bands). Breakfasts were only a little less elaborate. The main Yaeyama island, Ishigaki, where the airport is located, is a similar mix of tropical lushness and workaday architecture. Ishigaki City, the capital, has a laid-back friendly feel, and is a contrast after frenetic Tokyo. Stallholders in the covered market urged us to try sugar cane candy (yum), sweetmeats made with the ubiquitous purple sweet potato (don&apos;t bother) and salt ice-cream that it would be worth travelling 6,000 miles to taste. Young staff at a downtown restaurant did their best, despite the language barrier. Out came the phone again \u2013 we&apos;d have soba (buckwheat noodles) kitsune (fried), not zaru (chilled). We were then pressed to join in a session with a local folk-singer on his banjo-like sanshin. Diners clacked little castanet-like mittsu instruments, everyone swigging beers to regular shouts of &quot;kampai&quot; (cheers). We&apos;d arrived at our hotel, Nagura Cottages, on a quiet stretch of Ishigaki&apos;s east coast, late and hungry a couple of days earlier. Checking in, I had asked the manager if there was a restaurant near by. We must have looked stricken when he told us no, because he added, &quot;There is me. I can do dinner.&quot; While we settled into our room, in a villa across the courtyard, Sadoyama got busy behind the bar with knives and pans, and within 20\u00a0minutes was serving us a four-course meal that included goya \u2013 a bitter gourd pickled to sweet, spicy, sour crunchiness \u2013 and what looked like a mound of lettuce with tomato sauce, but turned out to hide a tangle of tasty shredded pork on a bed of rice. We&apos;d started with bottles of local Ji beer (chilled, but darker than lager) and when Sadoyama brought us, unbidden, two large glasses of the rice spirit awamori, clinking with ice, the evening took on a pleasant glow. Nagura Cottages opened four years ago to cater for scuba divers and is more basic than Eco Village, but with quirky touches such as pretty origami birds, made by Sadoyama in moments when reception&apos;s a bit quiet.     A lighthouse on Ishigaki island. Photograph: Alamy    In stark contrast to the other islands we&apos;d seen, tiny Taketomi, a 10-minute ferry ride from Ishigaki, looks much as it did when it was part of the Ryukyu kingdom, which ruled these islands until ousted by the Japanese in 1879. Preservation orders have safeguarded a central village of traditional one-storey houses, red tile roofs sporting fierce lion-like shiza statues to ward off evil spirits. Each home sits in a plot of land entirely enclosed by sturdy stone walls \u2013 it&apos;s a bit like the Yorkshire Dales gone mad. On the edge of the village we stopped in the flowery garden of a minshuku, (guesthouse) run by a wacky old lady with a towel round her head. We only ordered soft drinks, but she proudly brought out a little dish of pickled green vegetables and another of home-grown tomatoes in a sesame dressing that was so delicious \u2013 barioishi, the Japanese equivalent, we managed to say \u2013 that I don&apos;t think olive oil and balsamic will ever quite cut it in future. One way of getting around traffic-free Taketomi \u2013 it&apos;s an oval about 2km by 3km \u2013 is on a cart drawn by patient water buffalo, but we rented bikes for the short ride to Kaiji beach in the south-east. This is one of the islands&apos; &quot;star&quot; attractions \u2013 literally. The sand here is not ground-up rock, but the five-pointed skeletons of millions of crustaceans barely a millimetre in diameter. You really are walking on tiny white stars. The ocean views, shady trees and warm, pale turquoise water are pretty amazing too. But what&apos;s under the sea is obviously the main draw here, so at Umicoza Diving School, back on Ishigaki, we pulled on wetsuits and fins and took a dive boat out into stunning Kabira Bay \u2013 the multi-hued water dotted with rocky islets like a mini version of Vietnam&apos;s Ha Long Bay (but without the crowds). The couple of qualified divers on the boat tipped off backwards to descend on to the reef, but in these shallow waters we saw just as much with mask and snorkel. Convoluted coral in blue, green, yellow, white \u2013 though never pink \u2013 and most of the cast of Finding Nemo: triggerfish with white spots on their bellies and perfectly applied luminous yellow lipstick, emperor angelfish in vivid blue and yellow stripes, as well as the famous orange- and white-striped clownfish. We then climbed back into the boat to head for Manta Point, a little to the west. This is a world-renowned diving spot, where Pacific manta rays of up to four metres across gather to feed on the blooming plankton. Far from deterring them, the presence of divers seems to attract these giants \u2013 one theory is the air bubbles tickle a manta&apos;s skin. We jumped in and swam about for a bit, but we were unlucky. No mantas showed. We were not about to complain: the Yaeyamas had already given us so much. The Japanese word for plenty or enough is yoku, and to have griped about not getting more would just have been yokubari \u2013 greedy."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/04/future-drones", "publicationDate": "2012-08-04T00:09:16Z", "tags": ["Drones (military)", "Arms trade", "World news", "Business"], "sentences": ["Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Iran, Latvia, Mexico, Pakistan, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Arab Emirates all have active UAV research or manufacturing programmes."], "title": "Future is assured for death-dealing, life-saving drones", "article": "Lieutenant Uchatius could not have expected it at the time but his novel attack on Venice in August 1849 has become an important date in the history of modern aviation. The Austrian army officer launched 200 &quot;balloon bombs&quot; controlled by lengths of copper wire and timed fuses, over the city in an attempt to get the Venetians to surrender. He Uchtaius may might not have been the mother of invention but he may well have been the father of a new weapon: the military drone. More than 160 years later, technology is driving military and civilian uses of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into remarkable areas. On the smallest scale, moths living moths have had been implanted with electrodes in their nervous systems to control their movements. On the grandest, UAVs could be flying in civilian airspace by the end of this decade, some aviation experts believe. This potential is one of the reasons why the UAV sector is the most dynamic of the aviation industry. It is worth an estimated $6bn (\u00a34bn) a year, according to US market analyst, the Teal Group. And that figure is expected to double within 10 years. This potential has been accompanied by fears among scientific critics and human rights groups that downgrading the &quot;man in the loop&quot; means devolving life and death decisions to airborne robots. Those anxieties are unlikely to be allayed as established arms manufacturers and various start-up firms jostle for position in the competitive field. A crucial piece of technology is needed to take UAVs to the next level is a robust &quot;sense and avoid&quot; system allowing unmanned planes to fly safely in busy airspace. Arms maker BAE Systems is confident this development is within reach and that UAVs will be able to manoeuvre safely in civilian airspace by 2020. Lambert Dopping-Hepenstal, BAE&apos;s engineering director (systems and strategy), said: &quot;We need to design products that fit in everywhere. We want to open up [civilian] airspace. At the moment you can&apos;t fly UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] in unsegregated airspace and you can&apos;t exploit the commercial market. You have to replace the responsibilities of the pilot.&quot; Dopping-Hepenstal said Astrea, a collaboration between aerospace firms and the UK government, was looking at all the issues needed to persuade air traffic regulators that civilian drones were safe. &quot;They have to behave correctly even if they lose communications links to the ground. They must be able to behave as safely as a human pilot.&quot; Even then, he added, there would be little point deploying them on holiday charter flights. &quot;It&apos;s about long endurance activities like search and rescue. You can put them into places where you couldn&apos;t put a human \u2013 for example, an ash cloud. &quot;In Fukushima, after the Japanese earthquakes, they used a small UAV to assess damage and radiation. There&apos;s no night flying in fighting forest fires: they let them burn during the hours of darkness.&quot; A drone could carry on dousing flames overnight. The CAA says 120 companies and other organisations have been given approval to fly UAVs in Britain. Five police forces are said to be among them. At present the UAVs can only be flown within &quot;the line of sight&quot; of the operator, though even with these restrictions companies can see great potential. Andre Clot, from the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems Association (UAVSA), said: &quot;This is not an aerospace market any more. It is an information and technology market. We are seeing lots of small, nifty, flexible companies coming up with solutions, and they offer much lower prices than the bigger manufacturers. Eighty-per cent of the UAV market is made up of small companies.&quot; Drone technology is rapidly spreading around the globe and for the moment the military is still driving innovation. Since losing aircraft to Syrian missile batteries in the 1973 Yom Kippur war, Israel has been a leading developer of UAVs. It sells the vehicles to US and European armies. Working with the US manufacturer Northrop Grumman, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) had a contract to fly them over Iraq. The UK&apos;s Watchkeeper UAV, a military &quot;target acquisition&quot; spotter is based on an Israeli prototype. A spokesman for IAI said the firm had sold $1bn worth of drones &quot;over the last few years&quot;. More than 50 countries now manufacture or use drones. China, for example, makes the Yilong drone (which translates as &quot;pterodactyl&quot;). Beijing has said it will sell the armed surveillance UAV, equivalent to the US Predator, to Pakistan and other countries. Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Iran, Latvia, Mexico, Pakistan, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Arab Emirates all have active UAV research or manufacturing programmes. According to UK strategic export controls, in the last three months of 2011 alone, British firms exported UAVs or components for drones to at least 18 countries. As well as Nato allies, the equipment went to destinations including Brazil, Croatia, India, Israel, South Korea, Nigeria, Serbia and Singapore. Sustaining long-endurance flights for persistent surveillance or loitering above targets is a recurrent problem for designers. In the US, Sandia National Laboratories explored the possibility of nuclear-powered drones but suspended work because of public antipathy towards what would amount to a dirty bomb if the device crashed. One US air force strategist, Adam Lowther, suggested the USAF replace its strategic bombers with drones capable of carrying a nuclear payload. The White House has shown no enthusiasm for adopting the idea. Some drones are so small they are intended to resemble insects, to avoid detection. The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has commissioned a drone the size of a humming bird, equipped with a camera, from the firm AerEnvironment. A Dutch firm, Green X, builds drones that fly by flapping wings and are disguised as falcons or hawks. They have been flown low around Schiphol airport to scare away geese so the birds do not get sucked into plane engines at take-off or landing. The robot&apos;s radar profile makes it indistinguishable from a real bird of prey. Green X is working on multiple drones to simulate and redirect bird flocks. Bio-inspired technology has been a source for one of the more improbable strands of drone research. DARPA has implanted gold-plated electrodes into the pupae of tobacco hawkmoths to learn how to control animals remotely, exploiting their flights. There is also interest in such work in Britain. The MoD&apos;s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), which works from Porton Down, Wiltshire, and other locations, this summer produced a HoriZone briefing on current research &quot;to stimulate new lines of thought&quot;. The review, which notes that &quot;inclusion of any information does not constitute an endorsement by DSTL or the MOD&quot;, carries reference to a US patent on an &quot;animal sensor network&quot;. The US study, it said, aimed to develop a &quot;method for the remote guidance and training of free-roaming animal sensor networks&quot;. It noted: &quot;Electrodes implanted into the nervous systems of animals are used to provide clues and rewards by stimulating specific regions of the brain to induce desired behaviours such as the direction and speed of movement. &quot;Each animal carries a backpack containing wireless networking equipment, sensors, and data storage and processing equipment.&quot; Animals, it suggests, could be trained in odour detection. A call by the MoD agency for research proposals sent out by DSTL last September, asked for projects involving micro UAS (weighting less than 2kg) and nano UAS (60g or less), which would &quot;operate inside buildings and within deep urban canyons&quot; and explore in &quot;confined spaces&quot;. DSTL said it was also interested in &quot;bio-inspired technology&quot; for small UAS systems, aircraft that could detect chemical, biological and radiation hazards, and be used in &quot;crowd monitoring&quot;. Another use envisaged is for miniature drones that could land and &quot;perch-and-stare on the edge of buildings, on window ledges, [or] on telegraph wires&quot;. One big weakness of UAVs is their reliance on radio signals. DSTL is eager to improve anti-jamming technology to prevent unmanned aircraft being disabled mid-flight or even hijacked. Critics of drones, such as the International Committee for Robot Arms Control (ICRAC), warn that as communications can easily be disrupted there will be a drive towards greater automation of the technology, including selection of targets. Drone makers and developers often focus on civilian uses of the technology to try to stop it being demonised in the media. The US-based Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, issued a code of conduct, noting that: &quot;Whether it is aiding search and rescue efforts, navigating through airspace too hazardous for manned vehicles, or furthering scientific research, UAS are capable of saving time, saving money and most importantly, saving lives.&quot; While drones are best known for attacks on al-Qaida supporters \u2013 and bystanders \u2013 in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen, they are already being used for police surveillance, monitoring fires and inspecting wind turbines, crops, high buildings and power lines. Once they can fly in mixed airspace, their roles will proliferate. The possibilities are seemingly endless. At Farnborough airshow in July, Craig Lippett, of the UAS training programme, said he had been approached by the Welsh Development Agency, which said it was interested in &quot;using drones to count sheep&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/06/us-helps-philippines-improve-military", "publicationDate": "2012-08-06T14:59:02Z", "tags": ["Philippines", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China", "US news", "South China Sea"], "sentences": ["The developments come as the scramble intensifies for control of the South China Sea, a crucial expanse of ocean with coastline in China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei."], "title": "US helps the Philippines improve its military capability", "article": "The US is helping the Philippines to modernise and improve its military capability in the face of a growing confrontation with China over supremacy in the South China Sea. The Americans have already agreed to transfer two naval vessels to an underpowered Philippine navy, and deployment of fighter jets, a coastal radar system and even increased numbers of American troops on the ground in the Philippines are under discussion. The Philippines has several territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea, and while all sides know its armed forces will never be a match for China, the military moves are designed to give the country a &quot;minimum credible defence position&quot;, officials say. The US has transferred to its Pacific ally two decommissioned coastguard ships. The first, the Gregorio del Pilar, arrived August 2011 and replaced a second world war vessel as the Philippine navy&apos;s biggest and newest ship. The second is expected to arrive this year. Officials familiar with defence and security policy have told the Guardian this may be the beginning of an era of greater military co-operation. Rodolfo Biazon, chair of the Philippine house committee on national defence, told the Guardian there were plans to buy &quot;big-ticket items for the air force and navy&quot;. Lieutenant Colonel Miko Okol, spokesman for the Philippine air force, says surface attack aircraft, attack helicopters, long-range patrol aircraft and radar are among the items already approved for purchase and soon to be put up for bid. He says, &quot;I cannot give you a specific, like a specific aircraft, or what country we&apos;re gonna get them from. But these are the things we will be getting in the next two or three years.&quot; A request for a squadron of F-16 aircraft has been made to US defence officials, but Okol is unsure of where it will lead: &quot;We have told officials we would like to get these items as part of the things we might ask them [for] in terms of our defence co-operation with them&quot;. The Philippines may also receive help in upgrading its military equipment from US allies such as Japan, South Korea and Australia. Ricky Carandang, the presidential communications secretary, says that talks are being held with Japan to acquire 12 patrol boats for the coastguard. The US is also understood to be considering increasing its troop presence from current levels of around 600. The developments come as the scramble intensifies for control of the South China Sea, a crucial expanse of ocean with coastline in China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. China has been asserting its military power in recent years, claiming territorial rights over Scarborough Shoal and other island groupings deep in the 200-mile maritime exclusion. Smaller regional powers have felt cowed in the face of a superpower flexing its muscles, and are turning to the other global superpower for support. But Carandang says territorial issues are not the main reason for the drive to upgrade military capability. &quot;If you look at our configurations, there is always a focus on primarily fighting internal threats since the late Marcos era,&quot; he explains. &quot;Basically, we have allowed our external defence capabilities to deteriorate. Whether or not there was an issue with China, there was that need and the president recognised it.&quot; Prof Rommel Banlaoi, vice president of the Philippine Association for Chinese Studies, mentions the other threats which would be reasons for the country to build up its maritime domain: &quot;It can also mean against other international terrorist groups, maritime pirates, smugglers of arms, drug smugglers, human traffickers, and other forms of transnational organised crimes using the South China Sea, the Celebes Sea, the Sulu Sea.&quot; But Banlaoi says access to the sea lanes in the South China Sea is also an issue. Although the US says it does not take a position on competing territorial claims, it does have an interest in maintaining freedom of navigation in the area for American ships, whether military, civilian or commercial. &quot;In my opinion the US is doing this because of the China challenge,&quot; says Banlaoi. &quot;Of course it will not admit it \u2013 the US also has interests in keeping a cordial relationship with China as an economic power. The US fears that if China increases its influence in the area then it will affect the unhampered use of the waters in the South China Sea.&quot; According to Banlaoi, the support given to America&apos;s former colony is part of President Obama&apos;s &quot;pivot towards Asia&quot; is an attempt to strengthen all its existing alliances in Asia- including Australia, Japan, South Korea and Thailand. Banlaoi says that the Philippines needs the assistance most: &quot;Among American allies in Asia the Philippines is the only country with no credible capabilities. We are very ill equipped, in fact the Philippines is what I call belonging to the weakest link in the US alliances in Asia.&quot; The United States is also assisting the Philippines with a system to better monitor the archipelago&apos;s Western coast. Details as to the timeframe of such a project are unclear but according to Carandang, &quot;It&apos;s going on ..its moving, it&apos;s happening.&quot; Rep. Biazon details the form such assistance might come in: &quot;You need not only the radar systems, but including communication systems. You can&apos;t operate the aircraft without a radar. That will be part of the package. And probably even armaments.&quot; But debate exists as to whether or not these efforts to modernize the military with new equipment will really make a difference. Neri Colmenares, party list representative for the leftist Bayan Muna movement, believes efforts to make Philippines defence &quot;credible&quot; are in vain and will only serve to increase dependence on the US: &quot;We can spent a hundred years&apos; budget on the armed forces of the Philippines and it will not make our defence credible against China,&quot; he says. &quot;An increase in budget or capabilities is not the way forward\u00a0\u2026 because the armed forces itself has not been reformed. It&apos;s still a corrupt and politicised body.&quot; Academics such as professor Benito Lim, a China specialist who teaches political science at Ateneo de Manila University, questions the sincerity of American help, pointing out that China&apos;s defence system is stronger than all the military weaponry of the Asean countries combined. Referring to the Gregorio del Pilar, which was stripped of most of its weapons, he says: &quot;Suppose the Americans know that China owns a machine gun, but they give the Philippines a kitchen knife \u2013 it makes the Philippines look ridiculous when confronted with the Chinese in the Scarborough Shoal. &quot;Suppose they see Chinese ships enter the area of the contested islands. What can the Philippines do? Can they drive them out? They will probably just to do what they are doing now \u2013 say &apos;The Chinese are bullying us!&apos;&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/06/china-us-south-china-sea", "publicationDate": "2012-08-06T17:01:25Z", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "US news", "South China Sea"], "sentences": ["Brunei, Taiwan and Malaysia also lay claim to parts of the sea, which contains valuable energy reserves and fisheries and sees an estimated $5 trillion of cargo \u2013 half the world&apos;s shipping tonnage \u2013 pass through its sea lanes annually."], "title": "China lambasts US over South China Sea row", "article": "China&apos;s state-run media has lambasted the United States over its intervention in the South China Sea row, highlighting the alarming escalation of a long-running dispute. Furious commentaries ordered Washington to &quot;shut up&quot; and accused it of &quot;fanning the flames and provoking division&quot; in the region. The foreign ministry in Beijing called in a senior US diplomat at the weekend over the State Department comments. Analysts fear the South China Sea has become a major potential flashpoint, as tensions have risen sharply between China \u2013 which claims almost all the sea \u2013 and Vietnam and the Philippines. Brunei, Taiwan and Malaysia also lay claim to parts of the sea, which contains valuable energy reserves and fisheries and sees an estimated $5 trillion of cargo \u2013 half the world&apos;s shipping tonnage \u2013 pass through its sea lanes annually. &quot;While the likelihood of major conflict remains low, all of the trends are in the wrong direction, and prospects of resolution are diminishing,&quot; the International Crisis Group warned in a recent report on the six-party dispute. Beijing&apos;s most recent moves include offering oil and gas exploration blocks for bidding and establishing a new city, Sansha, which boasts at most a few thousand residents and 5 square miles (13 square kilometres) of land spread over several tiny islands \u2013 yet lays claim to 772,000 square miles (2 million square kilometres) of sea and its own military garrison. It prompted the US to publicly reenter the row, with a statement expressing concern at the growing tensions and singling out Beijing&apos;s role. The city and garrison &quot;run counter to collaborative diplomatic efforts to resolve differences and risk further escalating tensions in the region,&quot; said Patrick Ventrell, acting deputy spokesperson at the State Department. Beijing responded by calling in the US deputy chief of mission and state media ran a spate of hostile pieces. &quot;We are entirely entitled to shout at the United States, &apos;Shut up&apos;. How can meddling by other countries be tolerated in matters that are within the scope of Chinese sovereignty?&quot; asked a commentary in the overseas edition of the People&apos;s Daily, the official Communist party newspaper. The domestic version accused Washington of &quot;fanning the flames and provoking division&quot; in the region. State media say Beijing&apos;s moves are a response to the actions of Manila and Hanoi, such as a new law requiring all foreign ships passing through the disputed waters to notify Vietnamese authorities. In Chinese eyes, it is \u2013 as deputy foreign minister Cui Tiankai recently described it \u2013 a &quot;victim&quot;, not the instigator. Though its far smaller neighbours bristle at such a description, the new ICG report notes: &quot;China is not stoking tensions on its own. South East Asian claimants ... are now more forcefully defending their claims \u2013 and enlisting outside allies \u2013 with considerable energy.&quot; Shading the row is concern about the Obama administration&apos;s refocusing of foreign policy in a &quot;pivot to Asia&quot;. The US says it has no territorial ambitions in the Sea and no position on the competing claims to land features, but has a national interest in freedom of navigation and maintaining peace and stability. But Chinese hawks warn of an attempt to encircle and contain China while others argue that, at a minimum, its rivals are exploiting the US shift. A Xinhua commentary this weekend accused the US of double-dealing and urged Washington to show it was not seeking &quot;to clip China&apos;s wings and shore up the United States&apos; cracking pedestal in the Asia-Pacific&quot;. In a speech quoted by the Global Times, Zhou Fangyin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences noted: &quot;Countries with territorial disputes with China believe that the costs and risks of provoking China have largely dropped ... China&apos;s rapid rise may also make [them] realize that their chances of reaping and consolidating benefits by encroaching upon Chinese territories would be smaller in the future.&quot; In any case, argues Rory Medcalf of Australia&apos;s Lowy Institute, &quot;It has become academic to ask who started it ... What we see now is an action-reaction cycle.&quot; The multitude of Chinese agencies involved has stoked tensions, the ICG has argued, with poor coordination and some actors seeing it as a way to increase their power and budget. Increasing militarisation of the dispute makes it harder to resolve skirmishes, but could also raise the threshold for armed conflict, it noted. &quot;More immediate conflict risks lie in the growing number of law enforcement and paramilitary vessels playing an increasing role in disputed territories without a clear legal framework&quot;, it added. Domestic nationalism in other claimant countries adds to the difficulties. No one wants military conflict, not only because of the inevitable disruption of trade. The smaller countries would have to take on mighty China, while such a conflict &quot;would undermine [Beijing&apos;s] peaceful rise thesis, cause irreparable damage to its image and foreign policy in Asia and push other countries far closer to the US. Clearly none of that is in China&apos;s interests,&quot; said Ian Storey, of the Institute of South East Asian Studies in Singapore. Yet should it come to an exchange of fire, even the US could feel compelled to become involved \u2013 with great reluctance \u2013 to defend its credibility as an ally not only to the Philippines but countries across Asia, argued Medcalf. Analysts see little hope of resolving the dispute and say the best-case scenario is now the agreement of measures to handle clashes. &quot;I don&apos;t think any of the claimants have any good options. They have all painted themselves into a corner,&quot; said Storey."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/06/protests-vietnam-china-bullying-grows", "publicationDate": "2012-08-06T18:01:20Z", "tags": ["Vietnam", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China"], "sentences": ["History may repeat itself if the international community is not made aware of China&apos;s bullying.&quot; From government offices to the streets of Vietnam, tensions between Beijing and Hanoi have mounted in recent weeks over what China calls the South China Sea and Vietnam the East Sea, an area where vast deposits of oil and gas, important international shipping routes and fishing rights are of interest not just to Beijing and Hanoi, but also to the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei."], "title": "Protests in Vietnam as anger over China's 'bullying' grows", "article": "The banners, T-shirts and handwritten posters said it all. &quot;China! Hands off Vietnam!&quot; read one. &quot;Shame on you, bastard neighbour,&quot; said another. &quot;Stop escalating, invading the East Sea of Vietnam,&quot; a third declared. As the protesters weaved their way through the crowded streets of Hanoi, past the peeling colonial villas and upmarket shops selling stereos and Versace, they charged towards the Chinese embassy, where they hoped to make a stand against what they call &quot;China&apos;s constant aggression&quot;. &quot;I hate China!&quot; said one fortysomething protester, his voice hoarse from shouting slogans. &quot;Germany invaded Poland during the second world war, now China wants to do the same to Vietnam. History may repeat itself if the international community is not made aware of China&apos;s bullying.&quot; From government offices to the streets of Vietnam, tensions between Beijing and Hanoi have mounted in recent weeks over what China calls the South China Sea and Vietnam the East Sea, an area where vast deposits of oil and gas, important international shipping routes and fishing rights are of interest not just to Beijing and Hanoi, but also to the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei. But last month&apos;s protesters had only China on their mind. After detaining a group of Vietnamese fishermen near disputed islands this year, Beijing announced that the state-backed China National Offshore Oil Corporation was seeking bids for oil exploration in what Vietnam deems its own sovereign waters. It also declared Sansha City \u2013 on tiny Yongxing in the Paracel islands, which Vietnam lays claim to \u2013 China&apos;s newest municipality. The anti-China protest was the third of its kind in Hanoi in one month. &quot;The territorial ambition of China is a common threat \u2013 not only for the Philippines or Vietnam but for countries all over the world,&quot; said leading economist Le Dang Doanh, a former government adviser who recently signed an open letter calling for China to abandon its &quot;absurd maritime claims&quot; in the region. &quot;China&apos;s territorial claims are now bigger than China itself.&quot; Hanoi, 125 miles from the Chinese border, knows it must play a delicate game. Trade between the two countries reached an estimated $40bn last year, and analysts say that ties between the authoritarian, one-party states are considerably closer than either government would like to admit. The seeming standoff has pushed the US into the game, with recent visits by the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and the defence secretary, Leon Panetta, highlighting America&apos;s interest in its former foe. Panetta&apos;s visit to Cam Ranh bay, a US naval base during the Vietnam war, sparked particular curiosity over the US&apos;s intentions to &quot;protect key maritime rights for all nations in the South China Sea&quot; as it moves to deploy 60% of its naval ships to the Pacific by 2020. Carlyle Thayer, a Vietnam expert at the Australian defence academy, said Vietnam was likely to maintain its sovereignty by co-operating \u2013 but not aligning itself \u2013 with the US, but warned the situation in the South China Sea could worsen before it improved. &quot;Most likely an incident will occur from a misadventure of two opposite boats trying to be in the same place at the same time,&quot; he said. &quot;At the moment there&apos;s enough control [on both sides] but the analysis is that a lot of China&apos;s agencies are acting independently, and the central government is having a hard time asserting authority \u2026 the problem is that [neither country&apos;s] crisis management techniques are very good.&quot; The protests in Hanoi come at a time of uncertainty over Vietnam&apos;s political and social future. Its economy has followed a remarkable trajectory from colonialism and communism through to the doi-moi (&quot;socialist-oriented market economy&quot;) capitalism of the 1990s and beyond. Art-deco villas have been razed for multi-storey office blocks, and gaudy mansions dwarf the shady avenues of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, where men in slacks and women in short shorts and stilettos skittle past in glossy Mercedes and 4x4 BMWs. Here, the rich have become so rich that a Vietnamese businessman recently purchased an entire American town for sale in Wyoming. But Vietnam is running a huge trade deficit with China ($1.85bn in the first two months of the year alone) and its three million-member Communist party is struggling to maintain control over its population of 90 million, 70% of whom were born after 1975, and one-third of whom have internet access. Protesters are not just angry about China&apos;s territorial ambitions, but about the gaping rich-poor divide, increasing accounts of police brutality, widening crackdowns on dissent, and growing numbers of land evictions and human rights abuses. Reporters without Borders declared Vietnam an &quot;enemy of the internet&quot; as a decree aimed at making it illegal to post anonymously online means that bloggers particularly are under attack. Facebook is blocked, as are many blogs, and activists claim emails, phone calls and whereabouts are routinely monitored. The Committee to Protect Journalists cites Vietnam as the fourth-worst jailer of journalists in the world. &quot;Vietnam really is the new Burma,&quot; said Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch. &quot;We&apos;re seeing more of a crackdown on freedom of expression, a growing lawlessness in terms of the way police interact with people, a continued effort to go after prominent bloggers, to identify activists and jail dissidents. They&apos;re trying to prevent any Arab spring-type event where a mixture of information on the internet combined with people being angry and protesting ignites into something more. It&apos;s very embarrassing for Vietnam, because previously they were the influential ones giving advice to Burma, which was the basket-case.&quot; Now that Burma is no longer a pariah \u2014 thanks to the election of Aung San Suu Kyi to parliament and a slew of reforms initiated by reformist President Thein Sein \u2014 the shining star that was once Vietnam has waned considerably, says one local analyst. &quot;Foreign direct investment is flowing into Burma and declining in Vietnam. The government knows it is losing credibility. Vietnam allowed its private sector to develop, but it did not reform its political system. It was a fatal mistake.&quot; Dissident lawyer Le Quoc Quan, one of Vietnam&apos;s most prominent human rights activists who has been repeatedly jailed and beaten for his democracy efforts, said Vietnam was fighting a losing battle. &quot;More people know more about their rights, so the more they fight for their rights, [the] more repression, more arrests,&quot; he said. &quot;But an optimistic sign is that people are not afraid.&quot; While it is hoped a diplomatic resolution over the South China Sea will soon be reached \u2013 the Association of Southeast Nations agreed last week to a &quot;code of conduct&quot; that may see negotiations begin with China in September \u2013 it is just as likely that tension will continue. &quot;The problem of China and Vietnam has been a problem for 2,000 years,&quot; says Le Dang Doanh. &quot;If China keeps up the aggression, one million [Vietnamese] will take to the streets to protest. You&apos;ll see.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 7 August 2012.

His taste for &quot;ordered urban space&quot; has led to an innovation: the multi-faith district. On a plot of land just beyond the built-up area, he has authorised the construction of several places of worship. &quot;Here there will be two Buddhist temples, a mosque, a synagogue, a Chinese evangelical church and an Armenian cultural centre,&quot; said the mayor, a practising Catholic who is convinced that in a secular state the government should not turn a blind eye to religious fact. &quot;Our 30,000 inhabitants are mostly of foreign origin with 45% from Asia,&quot; he said. &quot;We couldn&apos;t deprive them of their religious practice.&quot; To date only the Taiwanese temple, a prestige \u20ac15m ($19m) project, has been completed. The shaven-headed nuns in traditional brown robes worked hard to make every flower, lantern and stone Buddha look perfect for the inauguration of the European headquarters of Fo Guang Shan, a Chinese Buddhist order, last month. There is nothing exotic about the temple, built on what used to be agricultural land. The mayor insisted that the architects blend the buildings into the landscape to avoid creating a religious Disneyland, just 10km from the real thing. The elegant wood and glass building covers 7,000 sq metres. A five-metre-tall jade Buddha towers over a prayer room for 400. The monastery has 36 bedrooms in addition to exhibition space, classrooms for Chinese, French, English, calligraphy and cookery lessons, and a restaurant. More than 80% of the cost came from the Fo Guang Shan headquarters in Taiwan. The 300 faithful in the Paris region also contributed. The centre, mainly geared to its international followers, is one that least meets the needs of the local community. &quot;But it&apos;s a project that has been put on hold for years,&quot; said the venerable Miao Da, who leads Fo Guang Shan and profited from the mayor&apos;s open policy. The organisation acquired the land at an attractive &quot;agricultural land&quot; price of \u20ac50 a square metre. Just a few dozen metres away, a more modest Laotian temple is nearing completion. A common parking lot separates the buildings, while a large plot of land is earmarked for a Jewish centre, a Chinese evangelical church and the Muslim cultural centre adjoining the 2,000-square-metre mosque, which will include a tearoom and a library. Its curved roofs are already visible, and behind them the walls of the prayer room for 400 faithful. &quot;We&apos;ve been praying in a pre-fab since 2010, and before that we had to go to neighbouring towns. The town hall lent us their functions room for Eid,&quot; explained Farid Chaoui, vice-president of Tawba, a Muslim association that is sponsoring the project for town&apos;s estimated 400 Muslim families. They are still one third short of the \u20ac1.5m required to finish the mosque but Chaoui has given himself to the end of the year to raise it &quot;without foreign donations&quot;. The mosque project is the one that caused the most controversy. &quot;I&apos;ve been accused of handing Bussy over to the Mullahs,&quot; said the mayor, who had to do some &quot;educational work&quot; and explain that he preferred to put a mosque in this open district with identified partners, rather than have people pray in a garage. He believes that people&apos;s reservations will disappear once they explore the neighbourhood for themselves. Ultimately it will also house the town&apos;s cultural centre complete with theatres and cafes. The mayor&apos;s &quot;living together&quot; project is supported by most of the people involved but the town&apos;s Catholic priest, Pierrick Lema\u00eetre, is rather more sceptical. His church was built 13 years ago and falls just outside the municipal zone. &quot;It&apos;s important that every religion has a place of worship,&quot; he agreed, &quot;but it&apos;s not enough to place pretty buildings side by side for people to actually get together.&quot; &quot;The mayor started this process ... He asked us to sign a charter committing us to mutual respect. Now it&apos;s up to us to make the project work,&quot; said Chaoui.\u00a0&quot;Live and let live is the only solution if you want to avoid stigmatisation,&quot; agreed Guy Benarousse, from the town&apos;s small Jewish community, whose project is delayed due to lack of funds. The mayor sees his concept as &quot;an attempt&quot; but not necessarily one that would work everywhere. A new town &quot;where you start from scratch&quot; is a good template for such experiments, &quot;And I was dealing with tolerant communities, not tense ones,&quot; he added. Unlike some of his critics, he does not see this concentration as a &quot;religious supermarket&quot;, but rather as an opportunity for people of different faiths to share resources, promote dialogue and enrich the town&apos;s cultural life.

Last Friday evening, when HTC warned that its third-quarter revenues could be 45% lower than a year earlier, the company was worth 236bn New Taiwan Dollars (\u00a35bn). In just three days&apos; trading on the Taiwanese exchange it is worth \u00a34.3bn. The first company to use Google&apos;s Android software, HTC was once seen as leading the smartphone revolution. Last autumn, while consumers waited for the new iPhone, HTC briefly sold more smartphones than any other brand in the US. Its subsequent decline, with shares more than halving so far this year, is a measure of how rapidly fortunes change in this fiercely competitive market. Since February, 47 foreign institutional investors, including funds managed by UBS and Invesco, have completely sold down their holdings in HTC, according to data firm FactSet. A further 88 funds have sold down their holdings in the company. The problem stems from the US, where the largest mobile networks have withdrawn subsidies from HTC in order to pump them into the two most popular brands, Apple and Samsung. According to Graeme Oxby, head of mobile at Virgin Media, HTC&apos;s slide in popularity may be &quot;difficult to come back from&quot;. Its attempt at a comeback this spring with one of the world&apos;s most powerful phones in terms of computing speed, the HTC One X, was drowned out by the buzz around Samsung&apos;s latest Galaxy model, the SIII. &quot;The HTC One is a really good phone, but it&apos;s just lost its cachet,&quot; said Oxby. &quot;You have seen a real polarisation towards the top end in smartphones, led by Apple. HTC are firmly in the middle, but the market has moved up. It&apos;s often difficult to comeback from that.&quot; The move towards phones that are increasingly able to do as much as a basic desktop computer has also hammered Nokia and BlackBerry maker Research In Motion, which have both issued profit warnings amid plummeting revenues. Founded in 1997, HTC is one of the newest companies in the handset business and among the most specialised. While Samsung has a history of making TVs and white goods, and Apple&apos;s heritage is in computers, HTC has concentrated on phones and pocket computers. It rose to prominence making phones to be sold as own-label by mobile networks \u2013 so-called white label products \u2013 before successfully marketing handsets under its own brand. The growth of Android helped propel it to a peak global market share of 10.7% in the second quarter of 2011, putting it in fourth position among the smartphone makers according to research firm Strategy Analytics. That share has now slipped back to 6.1%. &quot;If you&apos;ve got the wrong product you can decline very fast, it is quite a frightening market to be in,&quot; said Neil Mawston, who researches handsets for Strategy Analytics. &quot;History shows that when you decline so fast, the recovery tends to come slowly. We are looking at a two or three year time span for HTC to get anywhere near where it was before.&quot; He put Samsung&apos;s success down to greater marketing muscle and a bigger global sales force. Analyst Pierre Ferragu at broker Sanford Bernstein estimates that Samsung spends about six times more than HTC supporting its sales, while Apple spends nearly four times as much. HTC declined to comment on its share price decline, but its chief executive, Peter Chou, said in June he was hoping to increase sales in China and India to make up for falling income from the west."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/09/new-law-targets-chinese-traders-malawi", "publicationDate": "2012-08-09T10:28:53Z", "tags": ["Trade and development", "Global development", "Malawi", "Africa", "World news", "China", "Asia Pacific", "Civil liberties - international", "Law", "Small business", "Business"], "sentences": ["The country had just abandoned its 41-year-old ties with Taiwan in favour of the economic giant."], "title": "Malawi's new law targeting Chinese traders in rural areas draws criticism", "article": "The move in Malawi to close down Chinese businesses outside the four major cities has been condemned as xenophobic by rights organisations. A new law enforced on 31 July barred foreigners from carrying out trade in Malawi&apos;s outlying and rural areas. The investment and export promotion bill required traders to move to the southern African nation&apos;s major cities: Lilongwe, Blantyre, Mzuzu and Zomba. The law is an attempt to protect local small-scale businesses from competition from foreign traders. Two prominent civil rights organisations, the Centre for Development of People and the Centre for Human Rights Rehabilitation (CHRR), have warned the Malawian government against encouraging the victimisation of foreign traders. &quot;We are worried about the increasing xenophobia sentiments and attacks on foreign nationals who are doing legal business across the country,&quot; the executive director of CHRR, Undule Mwakasungula, told IPS. He argued that the way Chinese traders were being treated was in violation of their human rights. &quot;Malawi should not be perpetrating xenophobic attacks on foreign nationals under the pretext of protecting the interests of local businesses.&quot; The new legislation comes immediately after Malawian traders in some rural areas grouped together in May and convinced local government authorities to force out Chinese traders. The protests first began in Karonga, a bustling town in the north of Malawi, which borders Tanzania, and later spread to all 28 districts in the country. While there are no official figures yet as to how many foreign traders have complied with the new law, IPS confirmed that in seven of the country&apos;s 28 districts, Chinese traders closed down their businesses. They now have to apply for new licences to trade in the specified four cities. But many may not qualify, as the new legislation requires investors to deposit a minimum of $250,000 in Malawi&apos;s central bank as startup capital. Malawi&apos;s minister of trade John Bande said that the new legislation was intended to regulate foreign investment. &quot;The new law clearly outlines what kind of businesses foreign investors will be allowed to get involved in. We will not accept foreigners to come all the way from places like China and open small businesses and shops in the rural areas of this country and compete with local traders,&quot; Bande said. But Mwakasungula said that the main challenge faced by local businesses was that they lacked the financial and technical muscle to compete favourably with the Chinese. He said that it was unreasonable for the government to resort to such a &quot;drastic decision&quot;. &quot;It is unrealistic for the government to think that stopping foreign traders from doing business will automatically boost businesses run by locals,&quot; he said. There are no official figures on the number of Chinese or foreign traders there are in Malawi. However, Chinese-run shops, restaurants and lodges have sprouted across the country since 2007, when Malawi established diplomatic relations with China. The country had just abandoned its 41-year-old ties with Taiwan in favour of the economic giant. China has become Malawi&apos;s major economic partner since then. According to statistics from Malawi&apos;s ministry of trade, the country&apos;s trade volumes jumped to a record high of $100m in 2011 \u2013 a 400% increase from 2010. The two countries have a 2008 memorandum of understanding about issues of industry, trade and investment. It commits China to increasing Malawi&apos;s productive capacity in things like tobacco, cotton, mining, forestry, and fertiliser production. China has also given Malawi $260m in concessionary loans, grants and development support. This year, the country&apos;s first five-star hotel opened. It includes 14 opulent presidential suites and a state-of-the-art conference centre, and was built by the Chinese government. In April 2012, China&apos;s direct investment in Africa surpassed $15.4bn, according to statistics from the Chinese embassy in Malawi. But ordinary Malawians are not happy with the influence that the Chinese have on the country&apos;s economy. Ellen Mwagomba, who has been at the forefront of the protests against Chinese traders in Karonga, has had a grocery store there since 2003. She told IPS that sales in her shop plummeted in 2008 when the Chinese started trading in the area. &quot;This place is a hive of activity since it is a border area. Business used to be good until the Chinese invaded us, bringing cheap goods and taking away our customers,&quot; Mwagomba said. She said that her grocery store lost business to Chinese traders as they charged as little as a quarter of the price that local traders asked for their goods. &quot;The goods I stock are from the local industry and from South Africa and are of good quality, they are not very cheap. But people would rather go for the cheap Chinese goods, which are also of cheap quality,&quot; said Mwagomba. She said that consumers preferred to purchase Chinese goods, to maximise their spending power. Up to 74% of the population in Malawi lives on less than $1.25 a day. But Mwagomba and other like-minded locals convinced the local assembly to remove Chinese traders from their district. &quot;They started leaving in June and business is now picking up for us, even before the new law became effective. I am now making up to $500 in sales. I could barely make $100 a day when the Chinese traders were here in full force,&quot; Mwagomba told IPS. But many Chinese feel they have been treated unfairly. Fu-han Chao used to run a restaurant in Mzimba district, in northern Malawi. But he was forced to close it down on at the end of June, before the new law came into effect, following an order by local government authorities after Malawian traders complained about the cheap goods sold at low prices by their Chinese counterparts. &quot;The local traders don&apos;t work as hard as we do. We open our shops much earlier and close them much later. We even open on Sundays when most businesses are closed, and we are hated for that. We have been treated very unfairly and I feel really angry about this. I felt threatened most times, and scared,&quot; Chao said. He added that business was meant to be about competition. Until he was forced to close his restaurant, he said he had a number of customers and was making up to $800 a day. &quot;We are contributing a lot to the economy of this country. I am yet to decide on what to do next. Maybe I will go back to China, but it is also tough to run a business back there because the population is high and the competition is also high,&quot; he said. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has not supported its traders on this issue. At a recent press briefing, China&apos;s ambassador to Malawi, Pan Hejun, said: &quot;It is up to the Malawi government to thoroughly screen the Chinese nationals willing to invest in the country. These are small vendors and why should the Malawi government allow them to do business? They are capitalising on government&apos;s failure to screen foreign traders.&quot; He added: &quot;Rules should be respected and we don&apos;t encourage these traders to go into rural areas. We encourage real investors.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/09/china-gu-kailai-murder-trial", "publicationDate": "2012-08-09T21:06:10Z", "tags": ["Gu Kailai", "Bo Xilai", "China", "Neil Heywood", "World news", "UK news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["But with Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Malaysia all involved in the dispute, and with China claiming the entire sea, it was perhaps only a matter of time before a war of words erupted between China and the US."], "title": "China: a closed and shut case | Editorial", "article": "The biggest murder trial in China for decades flashed past our screens, and almost entirely below Chinese ones, leaving the outside world little the wiser about the essential facts of the case. What was the &quot;ample evidence&quot; against Gu Kailai, the wife of the disgraced political high flier Bo Xilai, who did not contest allegations that she had poisoned the British businessman Neil Heywood? Whose other crimes did she inform on, and could this be a precursor to her husband facing criminal charges? And why had all reference been dropped to Gu&apos;s alleged economic crimes? What had happened to Gu the greedy wife converting her husband&apos;s political empire into hard cash? A window on the intrigue-filled world of the Chinese elite that had been blown open all those months ago by the unexpected arrival of Wang Lijun, Bo&apos;s police chief, in the US consulate in Chengdu, closed firmly yesterday. China&apos;s Communist leaders wanted us to believe that this was a simple and uncontested criminal trial of a ruthless woman. To make the point they chose a court well away from both Beijing and Chongqing, the mega-city Bo ruled. The trial was barely given a mention on China&apos;s main television news broadcasts last night. Was this a display of collective confidence, or of collective nerves? The Bo affair was never just about the fall of a charismatic princeling, the son of a revolutionary hero, who had grown too big for his boots. It was also about succession. Before the scandal broke, Bo was to have exercised his natural right to one of the nine places on the standing committee of the politburo at the forthcoming 18th Chinese Communist party congress. The collective transition to a new generation of leaders had already been dubbed &quot;seamless&quot;. It is not, now, but the internal crisis that Bo sparked remains China&apos;s most closely guarded state secret. It is said that Bo had high-placed backers, like the security chief Zhou Yongkang. A report by the Financial Times that Zhou had been sidelined as a result of Bo&apos;s purge was swiftly contradicted by news that Zhou had been picked to represent Xinjiang region at the congress where the new generation of leaders would be confirmed in post. There may be no smoke without fire, but whose political interests are going up in flames remains as ever opaque. What can be safely assumed is that succession is a work in progress and that the demise of a politician as able and as loud as Bo may have suited not just the quiet moderately reformist old guard but the new one too. The biggest question left by the trial yesterday is what will happen to Bo, who has been suspended from the central committee pending investigation of &quot;serious disciplinary violations&quot;. The narrative created by his wife&apos;s trial, the implication that she suffered from depression, that she acted out of a perceived threat to her son, all diverts attention away from deeper questions about the economic and political power Bo wielded. The famed Chongqing model \u2013 increased state control launched on the back of a sweeping campaign against organised crime \u2013 has disappeared with Bo. But how many other Chinese leaders could suffer the same fate with their political and commercial empires? Bo&apos;s fate is a warning to anyone else contemplating breaking ranks. The palace intrigues of the heirs to China&apos;s throne matter hugely. If one were to place a bet about where the next geostrategic confrontation will lie, it would not be in the Middle East or even Africa but the South China Sea. Competing territorial claims for the 2m square miles of oil- and gas-rich waters have so far involved minor skirmishes between fishing boats and coastal protection vessels. But with Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Malaysia all involved in the dispute, and with China claiming the entire sea, it was perhaps only a matter of time before a war of words erupted between China and the US. China is thought to be backing its territorial claims by building four carrier fleets. It will need cool heads in Beijing to manage that power."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/aug/10/android-smartphone-market-2012-apple", "publicationDate": "2012-08-10T11:03:17Z", "tags": ["Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Samsung", "Apple", "Nokia", "Technology", "BlackBerry corporation", "HTC"], "sentences": ["Nokia, Taiwan&apos;s HTC, China&apos;s ZTE and RIM together shipped 34.4m, or 22.3% of the market - leaving a huge number of other vendors fighting for the remaining share."], "title": "Android tightens grip on smartphone market in second quarter of 2012", "article": "Google&apos;s Android mobile operating system tightened its grip on the smartphone market in the second quarter of 2012, making up 68.1% of the 154m shipments worldwide, according to the research company IDC.

But overall the market remains a two-horse race, with the two principal platforms - Android and iOS - making up 85% of the market, with the remaining 15% shared between four main platforms. And the concentration of control is also emphasised by the fact that two companies, Apple and Samsung, controlled 49.5% of the world smartphone market.  Nokia, Taiwan&apos;s HTC, China&apos;s ZTE and RIM together shipped 34.4m, or 22.3% of the market - leaving a huge number of other vendors fighting for the remaining share. Most of those are sold into China via MediaTek, and run Android. China is now the world&apos;s largest smartphone market, with low-cost Android phones dominating even more than in the worldwide market. In the US, the second-biggest market. Apple&apos;s iPhone has around 50% share, aided by subsidies from carriers that make it no more expensive than many mid-range Android handsets. ZTE&apos;s rise, with 8m handsets shipped, came principally through low-cost devices in China but is also working on sales in the US - though IDC observed that its lack of strong brand recognition could be a problem if it wants to see high sales growth outside China.  However the growth in the smartphone market segment - which accounted for 37.9% of the overall mobile market of 406m in the second quarter, according to separate IDC analysis - was the slowest since the fourth quarter of 2009, when the world was still recovering from the global crash precipitated by Lehman Brothers&apos; bankruptcy in mid-2008.  That has analysts wondering whether economic problems particularly in Europe will seriously crimp worldwide growth both in feature phones and smartphones. Ramon Llamas, senior research analyst with IDC&apos;s mobile phone team, said: &quot;Despite recent maneouvres to shore up several countries within the eurozone, the effectiveness of these efforts remains to be seen. Meanwhile, emerging markets will continue to be strong contributors due to their sheer size and growth trajectory, but how much they can offset potential declines in other countries is unclear.&quot; RIM saw shipments fall from 12.5m a year ago to 7.4m - a 4.8% share, its lowest in more than five years years, while the eclipse of Nokia&apos;s Symbian, which once dominated the smartphone market, was demonstrated as shipments fell to 6.8m - just 4.4% of the market, 15 months after it was earmarked for phasing out by Stephen Elop, Nokia&apos;s chief executive. But Windows Phone, Nokia&apos;s new platform, remains low, shipping roughly 5.4m handsets - almost all due to Nokia - to more than double the number shipped, but only grew its share from 3.0% to 3.5%. &quot;Android continues to fire on all cylinders,&quot; said Llamas. &quot;The market was entreated to several flagship models from Android&apos;s handset partners, prices were well within reach to meet multiple budgetary needs, and the user experience from both Google and its handset partners boosted Android smartphones&apos; utility far beyond simple telephony.&quot; &quot;The mobile OS market is now unquestionably a two-horse race due to the dominance of Android and iOS,&quot; said Kevin Restivo, IDC senior research analyst for mobile phones. &quot;With much of the world&apos;s mobile phone user base still operating feature phones, the smartphone OS market share battle is far from over. There is still room for some mobile OS competitors to gain share, although such efforts will become increasingly difficult as smartphone penetration increases.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/12/mobile-phone-handsets-fickle-fashion", "publicationDate": "2012-08-11T23:30:48Z", "tags": ["Technology sector", "Business", "Mobile phones", "Telecoms", "Android", "HTC", "BlackBerry", "Apple"], "sentences": ["They have become a life and death matter for manufacturers too \u2013 as Nokia, BlackBerry&apos;s Canadian owner Research in Motion and now Taiwan&apos;s HTC have found to their cost.", "It seems a company can go out of fashion faster than its phone \u2013 as the experience of Taiwanese prodigy HTC, which has unravelled in just six months \u2013 has shown us."], "title": "Only a very smart phone maker can survive in today's fickle market", "article": "A few years ago people used their mobile phones to make calls and, if they were feeling adventurous, to send the odd text. Not any more. These days we take for granted the mini-PCs in our pockets that can play our favourite songs and TV shows; they can even help you find yourself (if you get lost). Consumers are hooked on their phones and, surveys say, miss them long before realising their wallet has gone astray. They have become a life and death matter for manufacturers too \u2013 as Nokia, BlackBerry&apos;s Canadian owner Research in Motion and now Taiwan&apos;s HTC have found to their cost. The wrong smartphone, marketed in the wrong way, can destroy a company&apos;s market value in a matter of months. When Stephen Elop took over as chief executive of Nokia in 2010, the Finnish company was the world&apos;s largest maker of smartphones, with a global market share comfortably over 30%. A year later, and that share had halved, according to research firm IDC. In the ensuing nine months, the same thing would happen again and Nokia&apos;s share now stands at 7%. Asset sales, factory closures and job losses in their tens of thousands have followed. The decline has been just as startling at the once-mighty BlackBerry. Having created the ultimate email machine, RIM has been unable to follow up with a phone that lets you surf the internet without making you feel suicidal, and is now facing an existential crisis. In the space of a year, the company has gone from a quarterly profit measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars to a quarterly loss of the same magnitude; 7,000 jobs have already been axed this year. It seems a company can go out of fashion faster than its phone \u2013 as the experience of Taiwanese prodigy HTC, which has unravelled in just six months \u2013 has shown us. A relative newcomer to the consumer electronics business, it first found success making white-label Windows phones for various mobile networks. Then along came Google and the Android platform and HTC jumped aboard, making phones under its own name. Android&apos;s magic carpet whisked HTC into the stratosphere. Revenues doubled, peaking at Christmas 2011. Then, all of a sudden, the rug was pulled out from under its feet. HTC&apos;s newest handset, the HTC One X, failed to make an impression this spring and now sales and profits are in freefall: a company that was worth more than \u00a311bn in March is now valued at just over \u00a34bn. In an attempt to right the ship, HTC has sold back its stake in Dr Dre&apos;s hip headphone business after the combination of its phones and Dre&apos;s &quot;cans&quot; failed to inject street cred into the brand. The Seoul and Brazil offices have been closed, as has its research centre in North Carolina. HTC is still profitable, and may well bounce back. But history suggests that once they find themselves in a tailspin, phone makers rarely recover. Siemens, once a top-five manufacturer, began to loose its appeal in 2001. In two years its market share halved. By 2005 it had halved again, and the handset division was sold to a Chinese company. The decline of Motorola, once world number one, can be dated from 2007, the year the iPhone arrived. It took 18\u00a0months for half of Motorola&apos;s sales to fall away, and another 18 for it to loose its mojo altogether. The handset business was sold to Google last year. If anything, the pace of decline is increasing. Apple turned the mobile phone into a status symbol on a par with the designer handbag. As customers moved upmarket, two premium brands, Apple itself and Samsung, have taken control of more than half of worldwide sales. Mobile phones, like fashion, are looking like a dangerously fickle business. Walker can ride reforming tide The attraction of Sir David Walker, next chairman of Barclays, is that he stands for something. Try his comment to this newspaper: &quot;This is quite a good time to be reforming pay because of where the market in pay is. We may still suffer some breakages [employees leaving] but if people are only doing it for the money, they are probably not the people we need.&quot; It is impossible to imagine Walker&apos;s predecessor Marcus Agius expressing the view that you can&apos;t make an omelette without smashing eggs. Agius was happy to accept that pay would eventually fall across the industry &quot;to adjust to the new reality of higher capital and lower returns&quot;, as he put it at this year&apos;s annual meeting. But the notion that Barclays should take a lead in this made him bristle. Shareholders&apos; interests had to be protected, you see, and outsiders should be more patient. Walker&apos;s premise is that there&apos;s no time like the present. Hurrah! But the fine words have to be matched by deeds. The test will come when Barclays does suffer &quot;breakages&quot;. What if a team of red-hot currency dealers threatens to move to, say, JP\u00a0Morgan? Let &apos;em go \u2013 we&apos;ll find cheaper replacements, seems to be Walker&apos;s line. The good news is that he can expect shareholders to be supportive. During Bob Diamond&apos;s reign, most became sick of seeing the investment bankers protect their own rewards even when profits fell and returns were weak. Most are willing to gamble that the bank won&apos;t fall apart if a few supposed superstars jump ship. Walker&apos;s great advantage is that Diamond has gone. He can appoint his own chief executive and demand quick improvements. He is also helped by the Libor scandal: even on the trading floor, they recognise that Bonus Bob&apos;s downfall means life will now change. Just don&apos;t expect Walker to work miracles. His 2009 review of financial institutions had very little to say on the subject of banks&apos; behaviour towards customers. There were excellent recommendations on the need for non-execs to get up to speed on risk and challenge executives. But since then the full horrors of the PPI insurance mis-selling scandal have been revealed and we&apos;ve learned that small businesses were stuffed with interest-rate swaps they didn&apos;t need. With banks, there&apos;s always a new problem. Oil hunters in troubled waters of Falklands While oil companies are rightly pilloried over the environmental risks they take, you have to admire their bravado. After badly blundering in the Gulf of Mexico, it&apos;s hard not to admire BP&apos;s boldness as it set about trying to sign a deal with Rosneft behind the back of its existing (and already highly truculent) local partners, AAR. Similarly, it&apos;s fun to watch Premier Oil take a \u00a3640m bet on the Falklands, a drilling location Argentina has in the past been willing to start a war over. Premier Oil you might recall was one of the very few companies that hung on in Burma when it was exceedingly politically incorrect to do so. The management eventually sold out \u2013 and how frustrated they must be now that the gas-rich nation has been embraced again by the international community. The City has woken up to the Falklands being a difficult political destination, with Numis Securities last week changing its rating on the shares from buy to hold. But the good news for Simon Lockett and his team at Premier is that last week Noble Energy, became the first US firm to sign its own exploration deal in the disputed waters. Britain might no longer have the hardware to launch another liberation armada, but you can bet the US navy would defend its noble drillers if anything nasty kicked off."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/datablog/2012/aug/13/olympics-2012-data-journalism", "publicationDate": "2012-08-13T10:37:00Z", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Team GB", "International Olympic Committee", "Data journalism", "Data visualisations", "Internet", "Twitter", "Olympic Games"], "sentences": ["He&apos;s also ahead India, Taiwan, Portugal, Nigeria and Thailand."], "title": "London 2012 and data journalism: what did we learn at the Olympics?", "article": "There was never a guarantee that it would amount to anything for us.

Click image to explore it    Olympics are always judged on who gets the most medals and which country wins the most golds. Which normally means the attention focuses on the traditional Olympic winners: the US, China, Russia and the UK. But what if there was another way to see the Olympic medals table?  We worked with statisticians at imperial College to produce this alternative medal table, where countries are judged not simply on how many medals they won but how it compares to each country&apos;s GDP, or population, or team size. And the final winner on these measures? Russia. Says Imperial College statistician Christoforos Anagnostopoulos  The UK is outperformed by Russia despite having more gold medals, the reasons is that we are here ranking according to the total number of medals, where golds count for 3, silvers for 2, and bronzes for 1 - and Russia has far more of the latter two types than the UK. If we constrain our model to only consider golds, the UK comes at the very top of the list - and that&apos;s even after correcting for wealth, and population  \u2022 Read more  2.

The interactive above was updated every day to allow users to see exactly how the six biggest teams were doing each day.

Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP    The figures are controversial: according to Lord Moynihan, head of the British Olympic Authority, in 2008 50% of Team GB&apos;s gold medals were won by privately-educated athletes. However, it looks as if the real figure even in Beijing was lower than that. And that figure seems to have held steady or even increased slightly in 2012.

It is also 2% lighter at an average of 74.5kg, compared to 75.9kg.

How &apos;unbelievable&apos; is this in statistical terms? Dozens of arguments have been made as to why Ye Shiwen&apos;s sensational swim evening should or shouldn&apos;t be viewed with suspicion, many of them ill conceived, but one that stands up to scrutiny concerns a particular statistic. Ye Shiwen flew down the final length of Saturday&apos;s 400m individual medley final in 28.93 seconds, seventeen hundredths of a second faster than Ryan Lochte, the winner of the equivalent mens&apos; race.

The \u00a39bn figure that we have seen is just the largest part of a complicated set of arrangements involving public and private finance. We thought it would be a good idea to gather all that data together in one place - to provide a definitive guide to this Olympic&apos;s funding. We&apos;ve pulled together data published by the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) - and what we know of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Locog) to piece together a detailed picture of funding and spending. The difference between Locog and the ODA is, as a Locog spokeswoman put it to me: &quot;the ODA is building the theatre; we put on the show&quot;. The ODA has spent \u00a36.248bn of public money on getting the grounds and venues ready, with another \u00a32.537bn coming spent via other bodies such as local authorities and direct from the DCMS itself. Locog has budgeted the smallest amount: \u00a32bn. So, how did we get here? We have identified spending of around \u00a311bn - which is essentially the government&apos;s \u00a39bn plus Locog&apos;s published budget of \u00a32bn. Locog will not publish any details until after the games themselves, so we have divided up its funding using what we know, which is that Locog is paying for half the budget for ceremonies, half the budget for the paralympics and, obviously, the cost of running the events themselves. \u2022 Read more 8.

In terms of golds, he&apos;s ahead of North Korea. 10. How the Olympics - and Britain - changed since the 1908 games     1908 Olympic fencing poster    London was the first city ever to have hosted three Olympics. In 1908, at the height of the British empire, it was a last-minute choice, stepping in for Rome after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. In 1948, Germany and Japan were banned following their wartime defeat, the Soviet Union was absent and this was the &apos;austerity Olympics&apos; in a broke country. So, how does 2012 compare? The House of Commons Library, the team which usually supplies MPs with the answers to tricky research questions, is publishing the ultimate statistical guide to how Britain, London and the Olympic games themselves have changed. Olympic Britain, out today, charts how the world the Olympians of 1908 knew would seem unrecogniseable today. And how we got there. In 1908, the first modern Olympics of 1896 were still a live memory, and this was quite a different world. The majority of the competitors came from the imperial empires of Britain, Russia, Germany, the Austro-Hungarians and France, plus the new power: America. The five rings of the Olympic symbol weren&apos;t invented until Baron Pierre De Coubertin presented it to the world in 1914. Although the colonies were allowed to participate, it was hardly encouraged for fear it would lead to national identity and undermine their European masters. Two indigenous Africans from South Africa had been allowed to compete in the St Louis games of 1904, featuring in &apos;athletic games for savages&apos;, although they were allowed to enter the marathon, finishing ninth and twelfth out of 36. It wasn&apos;t until 1952 that any other sub Saharan country participated, Ghana, although it didn&apos;t win a medal until Clement Quartey won a boxing silver in 1960. \u2022 Read more 11. Providing the raw data itself is as important as writing about it When an event produces as much information as the Olympic games - but the data is as closed of as this, then there is a role in simply making that data easy to surface.

Here are some of the raw data highlights: \u2022 Every medal won in the 2012 Games\u2022 Every record broken at London 2012\u2022 Every athlete competing at London 2012\u2022\u00a0Every result for every athlete in every event\u2022 The Schedule as open data 12. A major news story always produces data journalism     Olympic torch relay: the route and facts about the torch and bearers Illustration: Paul Scruton for the Guardian    When as story dominates the news as the Olympics have done, cost as much as they have done and involve as many people as it did, there will always be data to analyse and generate stories from. It&apos;s more than just reporting results. And, as the games developed, the big questions of the day became around how to interpret the stream of numbers emanating from Stratford&apos;s Olympic Park and venues around the region. It became less about using other people&apos;s data and generating our own.  As soon as the 8,000 runners started carrying the Olympic torch around the country, data journalists started working at breaking down the numbers behind the news. This investigation by Help Me Investigate and published not he Datablog, for instance, looked into the hundreds of &apos;ghost runners&apos;, who weren&apos;t on the official list but were instead placed there by sponsors. The 25% of places outside of public nomination campaigns were allocated through internal processes at commercial partners, the International Olympic Committee, sporting bodies, direct invitation from Locog, and the relay&apos;s sponsors - one of whom allocated 15% of its 1,360 places for its own staff. Some data on places is still missing. The fact that this information was closed and required a major investigative effort reflects a lot of what we know about the Olympics: the stuff you really want to know isn&apos;t necessarily the information that&apos;s open and published freely. It&apos;s much more likely to be hidden right around the corner.  And if data journalism is about anything, it&apos;s about turning that corner and telling that story.

Simply put, we can&apos;t afford four more years of this president&apos;s destructive policies. Thursday, August 16  Steve Huntley, Chicago Sun-Times via @AndrewPeters112  What Romney&apos;s selection of Ryan constituted was a bid to return the campaign to the big issues \u2014 the poorly performing economy, unsustainable government spending, deficits driving the country toward bankruptcy, entitlement programs on a course to fail the elderly and poor they&apos;re supposed to help \u2014 and away from the dirty small ball of Obama&apos;s friends aimed at keeping the conversation away from his failed policies.  Dave Gilson and Josh Harkinson, Mother Jones  Mitt Romney&apos;s new running mate has been hailed as the closest thing to a libertarian on the Republican ticket since Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas). But aside from his Ayn Rand-reading, entitlement-busting ways, just how libertarian is Ryan? MoJo&apos;s Josh Harkinson made this handy Venn diagram showing the various flavors of American libertarianism, from cranky Ron Paulism to traditional free-market and social liberalism.       Just how libertarian is Ryan? Venn diagram by Josh Harkinson, Mother Jones.     Sticking Ryan on the diagram shows that while he has a lot in common with small-government, antitax libertarians, he has a lot in common with mainstream conservatives. He has supported extending the Patriot Act, voted to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and voted for the bank bailout\u2014all big no-nos for old-school libertarians.  Jennifer Burns, The New Republic  When Rand passed away in 1982, she was no longer capable of serving as the gatekeeper to her ideas. (The prurient details of Rand&apos;s personal life, which may have served as a deterrent to some, also no longer seemed relevant.) Rand had always insisted that her ideas were a package deal. Libertarians who borrowed her political ideas but didn&apos;t buy her epistemology were &quot;a monstrous, disgusting bunch of people,&quot; &quot;plagiarizers,&quot; and &quot;scum.&quot; Conservatives were far, far worse. &quot;Futile, impotent and culturally dead,&quot; conservatives could only &quot;accelerate this country&apos;s uncontested collapse into despair and dictatorship.&quot; Despite their agreement on capitalism, unlike most conservatives Rand was a forthright atheist who supported abortion rights and opposed the Vietnam War. After her death, her philosophy was liberated from its origins; it was now possible to mix and match bits and pieces of Rand&apos;s ideology to better fit the emerging conservative worldview.  Paul Blumenthal, Huffington Post via @AmericanAwaken  The massive increase in Ryan&apos;s bottom line didn&apos;t come through exploiting his position for personal gain, the way in which most people think congressmen make money. Instead, he made his money the old fashioned way: he married into it.  Ann Friedman, New York Magazine via @maureenoco   Like the stealth-libertarian date, Ryan has managed to set himself up as an underdog, a savvy and &quot;courageous&quot; hero railing against the status quo, even though his policy proposals would hasten our trip down the path we&apos;re already on, creating even greater inequality. He might look cute from across the bar, but we already know what&apos;s on his bookshelf at home. And guys like him never get a second date. Wednesday, August 15  Paul Krugman, New York Times  Like Bush in 2000, Ryan has a completely undeserved reputation in the media as a bluff, honest guy, in Ryan&apos;s case supplemented by a reputation as a serious policy wonk. None of this has any basis in reality; Ryan&apos;s much-touted plan, far from being a real solution, relies crucially on stuff that is just pulled out of thin air \u2014 huge revenue increases from closing unspecified loopholes, huge spending cuts achieved in ways not mentioned.  Janice, Gigabiting via @gigabiting   Ryan&apos;s best known connection to food is the guns-and-butter paradigm of his proposed budget which offsets billions of dollars in future Defense Department spending with drastically reduced funding for food stamps, food safety inspectors, and farmers. The Ryan Plan is so damaging to social programs benefiting our poorest and most vulnerable citizens that it prompted the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to publicly blast the devout Catholic for not just tearing holes in the nation&apos;s safety but for his &quot;shredding of the nation&apos;s moral obligations.&quot;These are not the actions of a man with an abiding love and respect for food.  James Surowiecki, the New Yorker  Ryan is not a pragmatist; he is an ideologue. His budget proposals are driven not by the demands of America&apos;s current fiscal situation, but rather by deeply held convictions about the need to limit government power. There&apos;s absolutely nothing wrong with this \u2013 if you believe that &quot;big&quot; government destroys personal initiative and strangles the economy, and that the current tax system is morally offensive and economically destructive, then you need to not just tinker with the system, but to remake it. What&apos;s wrong is that, so far, Ryan hasn&apos;t been honest about the fact that this is what he wants to do \u2013 probably because most voters, including most Republicans, don&apos;t actually want to dramatically shrink the government. Perhaps this campaign will change that. But I&apos;m not holding my breath.  Josh Trevino, the Guardian  Every re-election effort is a referendum on the incumbent, but hitherto, the only incumbent in play was Barack Obama. Now, there&apos;s another: Paul Ryan and the Republican House. Democrats who had to defend the lackluster governance of the Obama years are now given the superb gift of a man who arguably shares blame for them. The contention that Paul Ryan is as responsible for the failures of the Obama administration as Obama himself is deeply preposterous, of course \u2013 but that doesn&apos;t mean the Democratic campaign won&apos;t make it. And given the outcomes of past confrontations between this Congress and this White House, there&apos;s a good chance it will work.  Mark Mcdonald, International Herald Tribune  Mr Ryan&apos;s ideas on the new &quot;pivot&quot; of US military assets toward the Asia-Pacific; regional disputes in the South China Sea; an unstable Pakistan; a nuclear North Korea under a new dictator; recent reforms in Myanmar; arms sales to Taiwan; newly adopted military relationships, and other issues in Asia have yet to be spelled out in detail. But Mr Ryan, 42, who has proposed new increases in US defense spending, has spoken forcefully about his vision of American exceptionalism and a continued need for US global leadership, which he connects directly to the country&apos;s economic prosperity. Tuesday, August 14  William Voegeli, National Review Online  Amid all this arcana, we must not lose sight of two main functions of Ryanism, now the core of Republicanism after being endorsed by the GOP&apos;s congressional caucus and presidential nominee. First, Ryanism reminds the American people that a long-term trend is not the same thing as a law of nature. That the welfare state always has grown does not mean it always must grow. Indeed, a well-designed and well-administered welfare state can, in a welcome sense, grow and shrink at the same time. Second, Ryanism challenges the Democrats to finally come clean, 80 years after launching the New Deal, about the cost and consequences of their ambitions.  Jonathan P Hicks, BET  Ryan&apos;s selection might excite President Obama&apos;s campaign by highlighting the congressman as the bogeyman and champion of repressive policies. But for those people who live far from the world of Romney&apos;s wealth or, for that matter, the income or health care coverage of members of congress like Ryan, this is a disturbing, disappointing choice.   Ezra Klein, the Washington Post  The truth is that the Ryan budget&apos;s largest long-term savings don&apos;t come from Medicaid or Medicare or Social Security, or even Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security put together. They come from everything else. Ryan says that under his budget, everything the federal government does that is not Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security will be cut to less than 3.75 percent of GDP by 2050. That means defense, infrastructure, education, food safety, energy research, national parks, civil service, the FBI \u2013 all of it. Right now, that category of spending is 12.5 percent of GDP.   Giles Fraser, the Guardian  But here&apos;s the political problem for Ryan. Many were queasy when George Bush cheesily described Jesus as his favourite philosopher, but at least he knew his market. In contrast, few books can be as hostile to the Christian faith as Atlas Shrugged. For Rand, the good Samaritan was not simply a chump: he was in fact doing something wicked. We are saved only by selfishness. So how can an American politician, who has described himself as a &quot;staunch Catholic&quot; and in what is supposed to be an electorate dominated by Christian values, side with one who so thoroughly rejected all the teachings of Jesus?

(Mobile users can see the graph here.)     Smartphone market share 1Q 2007 - 2Q 2012; normalised to 100%. Source: Gartner    In sheer numbers, Android handset shipments more than doubled from 46.8m to 98.5m\u2013- far faster than any other platform. Of other smartphone platforms, only Apple&apos;s iPhone had more than a double-digit share, registering an 18.8% share - essentially flat, up 0.6%, year-on-year - as it shipped 28.9m units. That confirms the situation drawn out by other analysts, which see the smartphone platform race as belonging to Android and Apple - and the handset race to Apple and Samsung, which have about 50% of the market together. Gartner&apos;s figure for Apple&apos;s shipments is higher than the number given by the company in its financial results, explained smartphones analyst Carolina Milanesi, because &quot;we track sales to consumers, and Apple burnt inventory&quot;. The latter point, in which Apple is reducing the number of phones with carriers, could point to the launch of a new iPhone comparatively soon. The analysts reckon that new iPhone purchases were postponed by some who expect the company to announce the next version of its handset imminently: its market share dipped by 3.7% sequentlally &quot;as users postponed their upgrade decisions in most markets ahead of the upcoming launch of the iPhone 5&quot;. A growing number of apparent leaks from Apple&apos;s supply chain, as well as information from carriers who have begun stocking up on the nano-SIM agreed by Apple and other handset makers as a new standard, points to a release soon. Online speculation revolves around 12 September, though Apple has given no indication so far of any event on that date. But Gartner&apos;s figures also point to a growing world divide, with China trending towards low-cost Android smartphones made by &quot;white box&quot; manufacturers while western markets, and particularly the US, look to high-end names.  China is the world&apos;s largest smartphone market, with 39m shipments, or a quarter of the world total, of which 80%, or 31.2m, were Android and 12%, or 4.7m, were iPhones.  By contrast in the US, the largest single western market, total shipments were 23m, of which 58% \u2013 13.3m \u2013 were Android, and 36%, or 8.3m, were iPhones. Separate mobile data from Baidu, the Chinese search engine, analysed by Benedict Evans of the research company Enders Analysis, indicates that page views there from Android phones passed those from Nokia S60 Symbian phones during the second quarter, and at 21.4% are running at about three times the iPhone&apos;s 7.9%. Symbian is still second, at 16.6%. (Other featurephone platforms make up the remaining proportion of accesses.) That suggests that many of the Android smartphones being sold in China are not yet being used to connect to mobile data networks. The overall mobile phone market dipped by 2.3% to 419m units, as the number of featurephones sold fell even further, having peaked in the fourth quarter of 2010 and now begun a steady decline as smartphone sales grow. The latter now comprise 36.7% of the world mobile phone market \u2013 indicating a long-term decline for featurephone sales. (Mobile users: graph here.)     Featurephones v smarphones, world market, 1Q 2007 - 2Q 2012. Source: Gartner    That in turn poses a risk particularly to Finland&apos;s Nokia, which shipped a total of 83.4m phones in the quarter, of which about 70m were featurephones. So far, Nokia&apos;s adoption of the Windows Phone platform from Microsoft has been of little benefit; sales were around 4m for the quarter, still smaller than the fast-declining Symbian platform, which has been earmarked for phasing out yet still shipped on 9m handsets. &quot;Declining smartphone sales are worsening Nokia&apos;s overall position, as it had already lost the No.1 phone-maker position to Samsung in the previous quarter and is facing reduced profitability due to continuous declining sales of premium smartphones,&quot; said Anshul Gupta, principal research analyst at Gartner. Windows Phone eked out a 2.7% share, with 4.1m handsets \u2013 equal to Samsung&apos;s home-grown Bada operating system. But that was still more than double the position a year ago, before Nokia began shipping Windows Phone devices.  However for BlackBerry maker RIM, once a pre-eminent player on the smartphone stage, there is no let-up in the bad news: its share dwindled to 5.2% from 11.7% a year ago as total shipments shrank from 12.6m to just under 8m. Among smartphone handset makers, the dominance of Apple and Samsung \u2013 the latter shipping an estimated 45.6m units by Gartner&apos;s measurement, which excludes the Galaxy Note device \u2013 has left little room for rivals.  Taiwan&apos;s HTC saw a drop in total shipments year-on-year, from 11m to 9.3m. Motorola, recently acquired by Google, also saw a fall in total shipments from 10.2m to 9.1m; Google this week announced that it would cull 4,000 jobs, reduce the number of handsets and close a number of its foreign offices as it tries to return the company to profitability. But for Chinese manufacturers ZTE and Huawei, the quarter saw them driving up the world mobile phone rankings, to take fourth and sixth positions respectively, behind Samsung, Nokia and Apple."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/19/china-protest-japan-senkaku-diaoyo-island", "publicationDate": "2012-08-19T17:01:43Z", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan", "Taiwan", "Senkaku Islands"], "sentences": ["Japan controls the archipelago, which it calls the Senkaku, but the islands are also claimed by China and Taiwan, which know them as the Diaoyu.", "In a commentary, state news agency Xinhua warned: &quot;Sunday&apos;s landing, along with a barrage of other provocations, has poisoned the atmosphere of the Sino-Japanese relations and constituted another setback for both countries&apos; efforts to further their political and economic ties.&quot; Taiwan summoned Japan&apos;s representative in Taipei to lodge a protest over the &quot;provocative&quot; act, it said."], "title": "China protests over Japanese activists' visit to disputed island", "article": "Thousands of protesters took to the streets across China, attacking Japanese-made cars and smashing windows of Japanese-owned businesses, after activists from Japan landed on a disputed island at the centre of an escalating territorial spat between Beijing and Tokyo.

Activists from Hong Kong visited the islands last week to press China&apos;s\u00a0claim, but were arrested and deported by Japan. Japan controls the archipelago, which it calls the Senkaku, but the islands are also claimed by China and Taiwan, which know them as the Diaoyu. The East China Sea contains valuable energy reserves and fisheries and the row is complicated by long-running historical tensions. Many in China complain that Japan has failed to fully acknowledge or atone for wartime atrocities; in Japan, there is growing anxiety over China&apos;s increasing military might. Up to 2,000 people with Chinese flags and banners protested in the southern city of Shenzhen, overturning Japanese cars, attacking Japanese restaurants and burning images of Japanese flags. Qingdao, Taiyuan and Hangzhou also saw protests, while smaller\u00a0ones took place in several more cities across China, from far northern Harbin to south-western Chengdu. In Guangzhou and Shenyang,\u00a0protesters gathered at the Japanese consulates. There were similar protests two years ago after Japan detained a Chinese captain when his fishing boat hit one of its patrol vessels. But Sunday&apos;s outcry appeared to be the largest since 2005, when tens of thousands marched over several weekends. Chinese authorities have been markedly more tolerant of nationalist protest than of other activism in the past. The protests came after about 10 Japanese nationalists from a flotilla of 100 boats swam ashore at Uotsori, one of the islands, and waved Japanese flags. &quot;Four days ago there was an illegal landing of Chinese people on the island and as such we need to solidly reaffirm our own territory,&quot; Koichi Mukoyama, a conservative MP aboard one of the boats, told AP. &quot;This is a way of saying to not mess around,&quot; Toshio Tamogami, one of the group&apos;s leaders, told Reuters. The Japanese government had denied the group permission to land on the islands. Coastguard vessels were nearby and officials later questioned the activists. The territorial dispute heated up after the nationalist governor of Tokyo proposed that the city buy the islands, which are privately owned. The central government then said it would buy them. China&apos;s foreign ministry said it had strongly protested to the Japanese ambassador about the landing. &quot;The illegal behaviour of Japanese rightwingers has violated China&apos;s territorial sovereignty,&quot; it said. In a commentary, state news agency Xinhua warned: &quot;Sunday&apos;s landing, along with a barrage of other provocations, has poisoned the atmosphere of the Sino-Japanese relations and constituted another setback for both countries&apos; efforts to further their political and economic ties.&quot; Taiwan summoned Japan&apos;s representative in Taipei to lodge a protest over the &quot;provocative&quot; act, it said. Japan&apos;s prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, is under pressure to take a tough stand in the row and a similar dispute with South Korea over islands in the Sea of Japan known as the Takeshima or Dokdo. The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, visited one of them earlier this month, in what many saw as a bid for nationalist support ahead of elections later this year, and 30 of his compatriots held a ceremony on Sunday to unveil a monument there."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/21/novartis-court-battle-glivec-patent", "publicationDate": "2012-08-21T14:27:09Z", "tags": ["Pharmaceuticals industry", "Medical research", "Drugs", "Cancer research", "India", "Science", "Business", "World news", "Global development", "Private sector"], "sentences": ["It wants an Indian patent for its leukaemia drug imatinib mesylate, which has been patented as Glivec in nearly 40 countries including China, Russia, Mexico, Taiwan, Germany and the UK, and Gleevec in the US."], "title": "Indian court to hear crucial Novartis patent case on cut-price generic drugs", "article": "India&apos;s highest court is due to hear a case that could decide whether cut-price generic drugs for cancer and other serious conditions will continue to be available in much of the developing world. The long-running case, which resumes in Delhi on Wednesday, has been brought by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis. It wants an Indian patent for its leukaemia drug imatinib mesylate, which has been patented as Glivec in nearly 40 countries including China, Russia, Mexico, Taiwan, Germany and the UK, and Gleevec in the US. Novartis says the legal move is &quot;about protecting intellectual property to advance the practice of medicine, not about changing access to medicines&quot;, according to Ranjit Shahani, the vice-chairman and managing director of Novartis India. But campaigners argue that a victory for Novartis could result in the deaths of thousands of people who will no longer be able to afford the drugs they need. &quot;It would quite simply be a death sentence for us,&quot; said Vikas Ahuja, who was diagnosed with HIV in 1993 and is now the president of the Delhi Network of Positive People. &quot;I am quite sure that if Novartis wins, other multinationals will follow suit and other drugs will become prohibitively expensive.&quot; M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) believes the ramifications of a Novartis win would be felt beyond India&apos;s borders. &quot;If Novartis won the case, patents would be granted in India as broadly as they are in wealthy countries and on new formulations of known medicines already in use,&quot; MSF says in a Q&amp;A on its website. &quot;India would no longer be able to supply much of the developing world with quality affordable medicines \u2026 More and more treatments will remain priced out of reach for the duration of the patent term \u2013 20 years or more \u2013 including those that are merely new forms of existing medicine and didn&apos;t deserve a patent in the first place.&quot; Indian generic medicines are among the cheapest in the world, largely because India did not issue patents on drugs until 2005 after coming under pressure from the World Trade Organisation. Its size also means it has the production capacity to manufacture reliable and safe copies of branded medicines. As a result, India now makes one-fifth of the world&apos;s generics, such as antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV and Aids. About half are sent abroad, mostly to other developing countries. Even if Novartis wins, generic versions of Glivec will still be available in India because it came on the market before 2005 and is protected under a so-called &quot;grandfather clause&quot; in Indian patent law, said Shahani. This week&apos;s supreme court case is the final chapter in a legal spat that has rumbled on since 2006, when Novartis first tried and failed to patent Glivec. At that time, the drug was sold at \u00a31,650 per patient per month in countries where Novartis had obtained a patent. In India, generic versions of Glivec were available for less than \u00a3127 per patient per month in 2006. The patent office in Chennai rejected the claim on the grounds that the drug was not sufficiently new, but a slightly modified update of an older medicine. When India finally introduced a patent law seven years ago, it included a clause which decreed that &quot;patentability&quot; shall be granted only if pharmaceutical companies can prove &quot;enhanced efficacy&quot;. This legal provision aims to stop firms from seeking patents or extensions based on minor changes to existing treatments \u2013 a practice known as &quot;evergreening&quot; that is common in Europe and the US. The clause has allowed India to reject patents for a range of older drugs for cancer, Aids, tuberculosis, malaria and other illnesses that are made by India&apos;s generics industry. Given India&apos;s own poverty \u2013 30% of the population earn less than 32p a day \u2013 many argue the limits still make sense domestically, particularly as Indian patients bear at least 80% of their own medical costs. Branded and patented drugs are often 10 to 40 times more expensive than generics. Shahani said Novartis had brought the case to clarify India&apos;s investment environment. &quot;Knowing we can rely on patents in India benefits government, industry and patients because research-based organisations will know if investing in the development of better medicines for India is a viable long-term option,&quot; he said in an email on Tuesday. &quot;As one of the largest manufacturers of generic medicines in the world, Novartis understands the role played by legitimate generics and recognises that access to medicines is a far more complicated issue involving lack of diagnosis, infrastructure and distribution and goes beyond just making generic drugs available,&quot; Shahani argued. &quot;Without patents there will be no new drugs and without new drugs there will be no new generics. Governments, NGOs and companies need to work together to find innovative solutions to these issues.&quot; But those whose lives depend on affordable drugs are not reassured. &quot;Why do pharmaceutical companies spend so much on research that they can only make drugs rich people can afford?&quot; said Ahuja, whose organisation is party to the supreme court case, along with the Indian government and the Cancer Patients Aid Association. &quot;If they are only going to serve a certain class of people, they should say so in their advertising, rather than pretending to be so altruistic.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/21/china-japan-stirring-old-animosity", "publicationDate": "2012-08-21T18:00:01Z", "tags": ["China", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["Asia&apos;s maritime borders, and ownership of the oil and gas beneath the East and South China seas, are disputed between Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines, South Korea, China and Japan \u2013 but as China grows, so does its unilateral assertion of claims."], "title": "China and Japan are stirring up an old animosity | Isabel Hilton", "article": "Old quarrels take new forms when the world&apos;s power balance shifts. The Japanese and Chinese nationalists squaring up over disputed islands in the East China Sea are in the grip of geopolitical rivalries, jockeying for position on the new map that China&apos;s rise has created. Their deeper animosity goes back into the misuse of their troubled, shared history. When China&apos;s climb out of the economic trough began in the 1990s, the US was the world&apos;s biggest power, Japan the second biggest economy, and the Soviet empire recently deceased. Today, China is the world&apos;s second largest economy, Japan has stagnated for two decades, and US power looks less impressive than it did. As China flexes its muscles, the US shift in focus to the Pacific has come not a minute too soon for some of Beijing&apos;s nervous neighbours. Asia&apos;s maritime borders, and ownership of the oil and gas beneath the East and South China seas, are disputed between Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines, South Korea, China and Japan \u2013 but as China grows, so does its unilateral assertion of claims. Two years ago it announced the South China Sea was a &quot;core interest&quot;, in an unsuccessful attempt to stick a &quot;keep out&quot; sign on the dispute for the US to read. In July, Beijing elevated an island-based military garrison to city status, unilaterally giving it administrative responsibility over the entire South China Sea. In the East China Sea, things have been equally tense. In April Shintaro Ishihara, Tokyo&apos;s governor, provocatively announced a public fund to buy several of the islands from private Japanese citizens. His action embarrassed the government and inflamed Japanese sentiments, provoking a reaction from Chinese nationalists: on 15 August, the anniversary of Japan&apos;s 1945 surrender, a group of Chinese citizens landed and raised Chinese flags on the islands. They were swiftly deported to Hong Kong, precipitating the worst anti-Japanese demonstrations since 2004. The animosity is much older. For centuries China saw Japan as a vassal state and loftily accepted tribute from a people they regarded as inferior. In the 19th century, when Japan cast off its feudal system and modernised, the shock to China was the greater because of its historic contempt. When, in 1894, Japan defeated China militarily, the humiliation was felt across the nation. China set out to learn from Japan&apos;s transformation but was powerless to prevent Japan&apos;s imperial expansion and brutal occupation. Even after Japan&apos;s defeat in 1945, Japan&apos;s economic success and close relationship with the US perpetuated Chinese resentment. That Japan is the focus of popular rage in China today is less surprising, given this history, than the fact that until the late 1970s visiting Japanese were greeted in China with professions of friendship. It was only after the Chinese regime sent tanks to crush the Tiananmen democracy movement in 1989 that nationalist animosity became official policy. In the version of history elaborated after 1989, malign foreigners are China&apos;s enemy and the cause of the century of &quot;national humiliation&quot; from the 1840s to the founding of the People&apos;s Republic in 1949. &quot;National humiliation&quot; is now commemorated in scores of freshly built museums and taught to successive generations of school children. Among China&apos;s enemies, Japan occupies a special place as a brutal territorial aggressor. China complains constantly, and unfairly, that Japan has failed to apologise for its war crimes; the visits of successive Japanese leaders to the Yasukuni shrine, with its unrepentant imperialist message, infuriates China every year. Both sides distort history. Japan&apos;s notorious school textbooks are vague on war crimes; Chinese accounts of Japanese atrocities in films and school history books spare no gruesome detail. Japan as the source of inspiration and finance for a generation of Chinese political reformers, including Sun Yatsen, China&apos;s democratic revolutionary leader, is all but forgotten. Both the Chinese nationalists (the Kuomintang) and the Communist party claim to have defeated Japan in the war of resistance; the larger theatre of the second world war, the role of the US and the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki take a back seat. Both governments have stoked nationalism for domestic purposes. Now they risk being held hostage to the indignation of the street. As Asia&apos;s geostrategic map shifts, such incidents, demonstrations and provocations will recur, stimulated by false histories and present ambitions. These are dangerous games, and both governments should ensure that more sober stories prevail. These maritime disputes are a test of Asia&apos;s capacity to co-operate for mutual benefit.

Scattered Sand (its name comes from a dismissive term given to unorganised rural migrants) can be seen as an anthology of ghost stories. Its subjects, compelled to move by stagnant local economies and corrupt officials flogging off land to corporations, are invisible to many Chinese urban dwellers who have no\u00a0interest in learning about the crowded shacks or cheap hostels into which they squeeze. In Fujian province\u00a0Pai learns of men who toil in unsafe mines for the equivalent of 18 pence a day, risking lung diseases for which they can&apos;t be compensated because they lack work contracts. And yet, what makes this book so important is that Pai rejects the all too common and deeply sinophobic assumption that China can only be described in quantum terms. It&apos;s commonly portrayed as too big, its recent transformations too vast to grasp, its population a muted and faceless army of drone labour. Pai, by contrast, treks to building sites few outsiders visit, wanders down side alleys to talk to the poor and the crooked, keeps in touch with her confidantes by letter and by phone over a number of years. From these intimacies she shows her subjects not as ghosts, but as decent, quietly heroic men and women who sacrifice blood, sweat and tears to support their families. Literally so: in the &quot;plasma economy&quot; of Henan, a province full of underground blood clinics, she meets a peasant who sells his blood up to three times a day, in part to pay off a fine for having more than one child. Injustices and indignities scream out of every page. Starting out in Moscow where around 50,000 migrants eke out livings in the face of skinhead violence, Pai moves across China \u2013 the brick kilns of the Yellow river region where child labourers are common, Sichuan where years after the 2008 earthquake millions live in temporary housing, the troubled region of Xinjiang in which anti-Muslim sentiment is rife \u2013 to present stories that run counter to the triumphalism of politicians, starchitects and speculators. The book shines an uncomfortable spotlight on Britain too. After all, it&apos;s our desire for cheap toys and clothes to which many Chinese factories cater. It&apos;s our fondness for the freedom and mobility promised by laptop computers that fuels the profits of companies such as Foxconn at whose factories nets have been installed to stop workers jumping to their deaths. Are our labour laws perfect? A heartbreaking chapter in which Pai meets relatives of one of the cockle pickers drowned at Morecambe Bay in 2004 suggests not. Scattered Sand does well to draw attention to the ways in which millions of Chinese people, in the face of physical threats and a censorious press, have gone on strikes and marches to protest against their conditions. Classic labour texts \u2013 A Seventh Man, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men \u2013 often privilege exploitation over resistance. Pai, diligent to the end, and writing out of love rather than hatred for China, holds on to the hope that resistance is fertile."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/aug/26/new-africa-ethiopia-ethical-sandals", "publicationDate": "2012-08-25T23:05:00Z", "tags": ["Fashion", "Ethiopia", "World news", "Life and style", "Ethical and green living", "Manufacturing sector", "Business"], "sentences": ["Next month, soleRebels opens its first international store in Taiwan, and more are slated to follow."], "title": "New Africa: the Ethiopian woman who made ethical sandals fashionable", "article": " The idea for footwear label soleRebels popped into the brain of Bethlehem Tilahun Alemu in 2004.

For the past two decades, there has been a renewed interest in African development and that&apos;s come mainly from its own people. But there&apos;s a lot of work to be done. When you ask people from other continents about Africa, they mostly think of famine and drought and HIV. That&apos;s why we started Africa Rising [an organisation that supports Africans rising to their continent&apos;s challenges] to relate to young people and break down these stereotypes and misconceptions. We&apos;re now seeing great strides in countries such as Kenya and, to a certain degree, Sudan. But, of course, progress is hindered by a few people who don&apos;t want to see the majority prosper. In the period immediately following decolonisation and independence, there was a great spirit of optimism in Africa that the reality didn&apos;t match. How are things different now? What I see right now that is unique is an entrepreneurial spirit. If there aren&apos;t jobs available, create jobs yourself. Find the gap in the market. That&apos;s what Taiwan and South Korea did; Africa has to do the same. We tend to be a bit conservative; we can be reluctant to invest in new things in the way that the Asian countries did. We need to inspire the younger generation to follow their dreams, wherever they may be. Do you think South Africans still have the same positive outlook that the end of apartheid brought? There&apos;s still a spirit of optimism, based on the acknowledgment that we are only 18 years into a real democracy. We have our political freedom but economic freedom takes a lot longer. Given the amount of time we&apos;ve had, we&apos;ve done well. There have been mistakes, but nothing that can&apos;t be rectified with hard work. I think people around the world have become more detached from their leaders since the days when my grandfather was president and you had Tony Blair and Bill Clinton. There&apos;s a general sense of political distrust.  There are conflicting ideas about aid. Some economists, such as Dambisa Moyo, suggest that it has created a moribund dependency, others believe that it is necessary to lift Africa out of poverty. Where do you stand? I agree with Moyo that aid is a handicap that breeds a sense of entitlement. But you have to look at the various contexts. A drought is something nature brings upon us\u00a0and in those situations aid is very\u00a0valuable. You grew up in America. Did you think of yourself as an African? Yes, I have always associated myself with Africa. My parents would make me wear the dashiki. My dad always talked to me about where he came from, Ghana. But I didn&apos;t have a real attachment to the continent until I came back in 1994 and interacted with the people in South Africa. I started travelling and gained a sense of pride and understanding. You see people who don&apos;t have the means that people have in first world countries but they are so content with who they are. That spirit resonated with me.  You say you want Africans to take pride in being Africans. What does that mean? Well, you saw examples of pride during the Olympics. Sometimes, it takes an event like that to create a feeling of unity. In Africa it is hard for people to say they are proud, when their continent has had such a negative image for so long. We need to instil pride through the way we interact with the world and each other. What do you think will be the effect of the recent Lonmin miners\u00a0tragedy? I think the Lonmin strike will have a far-reaching impact on South Africa. The people tasked with bringing this divide to an end, the mine bosses and the trade union management, still can&apos;t find a middle ground and so the strike and troubles go on. Did the police overreact? Yes. Were the the miners carrying lethal weapons? Yes. Do the miners deserve a pay increase? Yes. How do we readdress the economic imbalance we face in my country ? It&apos;s something we are working on each day and I&apos;m hopeful that we will find a way to correct it.  Do you have mixed feelings about being Nelson Mandela&apos;s grandson? His name must have opened doors for you, but does his shadow prevent you from being seen as your own man? Every individual has a surname they have to live up to. I&apos;ve come to terms with mine. I&apos;m very proud of my grandad. There&apos;s a lot in his life that I want to use in mine. In the end, you have to live your own life and do the things you&apos;re passionate about and I think people will acknowledge that regardless of who my grandfather is. When you speak about an African identity, do you believe people in Egypt have more in common with people in Namibia than with people in Syria? Definitely. You can talk about the north African countries being closer to Arab culture, but ultimately they&apos;re still part of the African continent and it&apos;s to this continent that they trace their roots. We&apos;re a diverse continent, but what unites us is the belief that we want our people to experience a life of education and health services and employment. You&apos;re involved in a TV project about your grandfather. We&apos;re going to start that at the beginning of next year. We&apos;re finishing the scripts and are looking at casting. I&apos;ve kept my grandfather up to date about the story angle. It&apos;s going to be about his life and that of his comrades, but also the workings of apartheid. The main thing for him was to show that it wasn&apos;t just him, but there were others involved, such as Walter Sisulu and Oliver Tambo. Do you think Africa Rising has had an impact on young people in Africa? Sure, in a number of ways. For example, Wembley to Soweto was a project we started in 2010. It started with us taking eight kids from Soweto and teaching them how to use photography. Most of them had never thought of photography as a way of making a living and they&apos;d never travelled out of South Africa. This gave them an opportunity to do that and bring it back to their communities. These kids were lacking confidence, but now they have a purpose and stand tall when they speak to you. What would really help change perceptions of Africa? Ultimately, it&apos;s about people getting to know each other. We need to get people interested in coming to the continent, exploring it for themselves.

Throughout the 1980s, China&apos;s economy grew on average 6.7% a year faster than OECD economies. During the 1990s, the lead increased to 7.4% and since 2000, it has been 8.4%. But with China&apos;s increasing lead in economic growth came the claim that its economy faced an imminent meltdown. As such claims clearly bore no relation to the facts, they functioned as propaganda. For this reason, they were particularly emphasised at various points during the western economic slowdown. It is therefore unsurprising that, as the latest data shows US GDP growth slowing to 1.5% and the EU&apos;s economy contracting at an annualised -0.6%, articles duly appeared warning of immense crisis in China. A typical example appeared in the New York Times, where under the dire headline &quot;China confronts mounting piles of unsold goods&quot;, the author advanced the following analysis: &quot;The glut of everything from steel and household appliances to cars and apartments is hampering China&apos;s efforts to emerge from a sharp economic slowdown.&quot; The article lists various data regarding China&apos;s housing and car markets, and argued that &quot;problems in China give some economists nightmares&quot;. Let&apos;s examine what&apos;s really happening instead: the market economy necessarily continuously has sectors with shortages, and others with excess supply \u2013 the market exists to create the adjustments arising from this. As there are always &quot;unsold goods&quot; in individual sectors, it does not prove anything as they may be balanced by others in which shortages exist. Take current examples from China. Its car makers are currently facing difficulties, in part due to city authorities making car ownership more difficult (they realised that given China&apos;s population, attempting to have the same balance between public and car transport as in the west creates gridlock). But in another sector, China&apos;s mainland smartphone producers are currently enjoying huge competitive success, seizing 54% of China&apos;s market (now the world&apos;s largest) from non-mainland producers. Chinese firms such as Lenovo, Coolpad, Huawei and ZTE are pushing ahead of Apple and Taiwan&apos;s HTC in market share. Only the average of all sectors shows the real economic situation, and that trend is clear: China&apos;s economy has slowed moderately. Its year on year GDP growth in the second quarter of 2012 was 7.6%. Over the same period, the US economy grew by 2.2%, the EU&apos;s was up by 0.2% and the UK&apos;s shrank by 0.5%. China&apos;s GDP growth was therefore three times that of the US, 74 times that of the EU and going in the opposite direction to the UK. This is quite sufficient to show that China&apos;s economy is not in a crisis comparable to the west: what is claimed to be crisis in China would be unparalleled economic success in the US or Europe. This does not mean China faces no economic problems. In the last decade, China has undergone the most rapid increase in per capita GDP in a major economy in human history; it is impossible to undergo such growth without problems \u2013 among the most notable being serious environmental issues and a socially destabilising level of income inequality. In the first half of this year, China&apos;s economic policy making was also hampered by influences stemming from the erroneous World Bank Report on China, which advocated abandoning the economic policies inaugurated by Deng Xiaoping, which have produced such success. It recommended that China should instead adopt a western economic structure \u2013 a somewhat strange proposal given the current crisis of the US/European economic model. This led to initial hesitation in launching sufficient state investment to reverse economic slowdown, a mistake corrected in July when premier Wen Jiabao stated &quot;currently the main task is to promote reasonable investment growth&quot; followed by China&apos;s regional authorities rolling out wider investment-based stimulus programmes. There are serious economic policy issues to be discussed on China. The latest blooming of the hardy perennial &quot;the coming collapse of China&quot; is not among them."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/men-sitting-down-on-toilets", "publicationDate": "2012-08-29T11:04:22Z", "tags": ["Life and style", "Gender", "Taiwan", "World news"], "sentences": ["Not because I&apos;m about to tell you something shocking, but because if the rest of the world is to follow the lead of Taiwan, we&apos;ll soon have to do so several times a day."], "title": "Men have a wee problem with sitting down on toilets | Ally Fogg", "article": "At my primary school, we boys vied for pecking position via the traditional routes of fighting, football and fabricating extravagant fibs, but there was something else.

I&apos;m no biomechanic, but it seems to me that if you were to design a waste water drainage system for a semi-intelligent carbon-based lifeform, you could do little better than an easily-accessed length of flexible hosepipe, complete with directional nozzle, that can be tucked out of harm&apos;s way when not needed. And thanks to the miracle of evolution, this gadget protrudes at the precise same place on the human body where we find the zip of our trousers. It is such a miracle that one might be tempted to credit it to the intelligent design of a benevolent creator, were it not for one small design flaw \u2013 accuracy. Some women may find this hard to believe, but most of the time men are pretty accurate. Nine times out of 10 we could knock a bee off a bottletop with a single blast.

On the other we have \u2026 OK I admit it \u2013 nothing. Nada. Zilch. There is not a single argument to be made for standing up to wee except, damn it, it feels right.

But this man isn&apos;t convinced. &quot;What are you selling?&quot; he asks. &quot;Nothing,&quot; I explain. &quot;We&apos;re just offering hugs to people.

I open my arms in what I hope is a welcoming, earth-motherly fashion. I remember what I&apos;ve been told in the pre-hugs briefing by the group co-ordinator: smile, but not so much that you look psychotic, and don&apos;t take offence if someone doesn&apos;t want to hug you back. I wait. The man looks uneasy, a bit embarrassed and then, unexpectedly, his face breaks into a smile. He hugs me. And although I&apos;ve been secretly dreading the moment when I&apos;ll have to engage in a surprisingly intimate act with a stranger who might have all manner of personal hygiene problems, I discover that it&apos;s a nice feeling. We hold each other for a moment, then release. We exchange smiles and I watch as he makes his way back down the street. I like to think there is a certain lightness in his step that wasn&apos;t there before, but it&apos;s probably just that he&apos;s walking more quickly in order to get away from the crazy woman with the &quot;Free Hugs&quot; placard. The story of how I got to be here, pressing flesh with random pedestrians, is an intriguing one. It is a story of how, eight years ago, a man from Sydney set out to bring us all a little bit closer and founded the Free Hugs movement. It is a story of how the idea caught hold of people&apos;s imaginations across the globe and made him famous. It is a story of how he set out to spread free love but ended up in a battle of bitter recrimination over money. And it is a story, ultimately, about how you can start with the best of intentions and yet end up disillusioned. In June 2004, an Australian who went by the pseudonym Juan Mann started giving out free hugs in his local shopping mall. Mann had reached a point of personal crisis in his own life: his parents had divorced and his fianc\u00e9e had broken off their engagement. He realised that people were living increasingly disconnected lives. The need for human contact had been neglected. In Mann&apos;s eyes, we were living in a computer-mediated culture where friends were made through MySpace and families were breaking down. Where previously small-scale local communities had been integral to individual wellbeing, now people were pursuing far-flung separate lives in different corners of the globe. Mann hand-wrote a sign advertising Free Hugs and went to the Pitt Street Mall in central Sydney, where he stood for 15 long, lonely minutes before an elderly lady took pity on him. Her dog had just died, she confessed, and the hug had made her feel better. Soon Juan Mann was handing out hugs every few seconds. As the days passed, more volunteers with their own handwritten signs came and stood alongside him. Shimon Moore was one of them. &quot;I had a job holding a sign advertising a sale on shoes,&quot; Moore says, speaking to me from his home in Los Angeles. &quot;I saw this guy offering free hugs one day. I thought it was a great idea, so I started talking to him.&quot; Moore wrote songs in his spare time and was the lead singer for a band called Sick Puppies. The band was looking for a record deal, so Moore took his father&apos;s video camera to the mall and started to film Juan Mann with the idea of making a music video. Free Hugs had started taking off: every day, hundreds of shoppers would stop to be hugged by the anonymous man with the home-made placard. By October the police had got wind of it and threatened to ban the movement. Ten thousand people signed a petition. The police backed down. Moore filmed it all. When he and his band, Sick Puppies, moved to Los Angeles in March 2005 in search of a record deal, he edited the footage, set it to music and sent it back to Mann in Sydney as a present. Mann posted the video on YouTube and it went viral, attracting 70m views. &quot;I had a feeling when I was making it that this was good, that it would connect with people \u2013 and that doesn&apos;t happen often,&quot; Moore says now. &quot;I did it in one night. It was just really flowing.&quot; The YouTube video made Juan Mann into something of a celebrity and his campaign attracted global media coverage. By 2006 he was being interviewed by Oprah Winfrey and Free Hugs was going international: branches sprang up in Taiwan, Israel, Italy, America, Switzerland, Norway, India, Portugal and the UK. It seemed to touch a nerve. In Philadelphia a sociology professor called Faye Allard set up her own Free Hugs spin-off and explained its appeal. &quot;The success of the movement reflects the fact that we&apos;re all becoming increasingly isolated,&quot; she said. &quot;Households no longer contain extended family, people stay single for longer and have children later. This is compounded by the fact that we have become more geographically mobile\u2026 Phones, the internet and email mean that much of our personal contact is reduced to electronic interaction. What the Free Hugs movement does is restore a sense of community in a society of disparate individuals. It gives us a sense that we belong.&quot; Off the back of the YouTube video, Moore and his band got a record deal. They started selling Free Hugs merchandise at their gigs \u2013 T-shirts and mugs emblazoned with Juan Mann&apos;s distinctive handwriting. Mann wrote a book \u2013 The Illustrated Guide to Free Hugs \u2013 became an after-dinner speaker and published his address and mobile-phone number online, offering to go for a meal with anyone who contacted him. For a while, everything was good. But then it all went quiet. When I attempt to get in touch with Juan Mann, he seems to have disappeared. I try sending him messages through his website, his Facebook profile and his Twitter account. I call the number he published online and the line goes dead. I contact his friends, none of whom will tell me his real name. They tell me Juan hasn&apos;t been in touch for a long time. There are a few dark murmurings about him &quot;flipping out&quot; and going to live in a surfer&apos;s community north of Sydney. One of them gives me another phone number and that doesn&apos;t work either. Eventually I track down a brief interview Mann gave to a New York-based business news website in 2010 in which he claimed Shimon Moore had screwed him over financially by getting him to sign up with the same management company that represented Sick Puppies. &quot;I complied, believing that Shimon, as my friend, would make certain that we were both amply compensated for the video and the Free Hugs merchandise the band sells,&quot; Mann said. But according to Mann, that didn&apos;t happen: he claimed all the earnings went straight to Moore and his band members. &quot;Needless to say,&quot; Mann continued, &quot;we aren&apos;t friends anymore\u2026 I haven&apos;t seen a dollar from the band, nor the manager.&quot; When I speak to Moore, he is clearly uncomfortable. &quot;That&apos;s a touchy subject,&quot; he says over the phone. &quot;I haven&apos;t commented before because I don&apos;t want to fuck up the brand. The truth is, we had a falling-out over money\u2026 Juan flipped out and got lawyers and stuff. He totally changed when he got famous, and it messed up our friendship. But I don&apos;t want people to focus on that because Free Hugs is supposed to be about love, not two guys bickering.&quot; Moore seems genuinely distressed about the falling-out. He loved Free Hugs. &quot;It wasn&apos;t a Christian thing or a colour thing or a cultural thing in one country,&quot; he says. &quot;Everyone likes a hug no matter what, no matter how broken you are. &quot;It&apos;s just a shame because it was Juan&apos;s thing: he made it, he started it.&quot; He sighs. &quot;But the beautiful thing now is that it&apos;s so much bigger than any one person.&quot; He sounds as if he is trying to persuade himself. And yet it is true that the concept of Free Hugs has been extremely influential. People still stand on busy streets holding placards in much the same way as Juan Mann did all those years ago. Majella Greene, a former social worker, founded the London-based Guerrilla Hugs in January 2010. She is currently studying for an MSc in Positive Psychology and is interested in the positive impact touch can have on human interaction. &quot;My concern is that as we get older, as children grow up, the amount we experience positive, platonic touching reduces,&quot; Greene says when we meet in a caf\u00e9 with other volunteers who have given up their time to hug total strangers of a Thursday evening. Greene is an enthusiastic and bubbly speaker, much given to expressive hand gestures. I get the impression that most of the people round the table have been won over by the sheer zeal of her personality. &quot;In the UK, there&apos;s this moral panic about physical contact with other people, either in the workplace or with children because of concerns around sexual harassment or worries that teachers are going to be accused of paedophilia,&quot; she says. &quot;You&apos;ve got a generation of children growing up playing computer games without being able to take part in normal rough and tumble that builds up alliances.&quot; Greene cites research by the psychologist James W Prescott, who claimed in the 60s and 70s that the lack of affectionate contact between mothers and infants could result in permanent brain abnormalities associated with depression, substance abuse, eating disorders and violence. More recently the evolutionary anthropologist Robin Dunbar found that primates groom each other for longer than they need to in order to cement bonds, make friends and influence fellow primates. &quot;I think that&apos;s true of human beings as well,&quot; explains Greene. &quot;If they experience non- sexual physical contact, they&apos;re more likely to feel protected and protective of each other.&quot; Greene says that everyone has their favourite hugging story. &quot;I hugged an older man a while back whose wife had died 14 years ago and he hadn&apos;t been hugged in all that time,&quot; she recalls, looking distinctly misty-eyed. &quot;He stood talking for ages about how he&apos;d not been held or touched and how it made him feel better that I had\u2026 When people turn round and say: &apos;Thank you, I really needed that,&apos; it makes me want to cry.&quot; There is a sense that such acts of gentleness are having a necessary comeback after decades of aggressive self-interest and self-promotion. Perhaps it is partly allied to the economic crisis, to a new-found respect for the simpler things in life that do not need to be bought with a credit card. For years we worshipped at the altar of conspicuous consumption in an age when fame was accorded for marrying a footballer or appearing on reality television, and when friendships were made and lost at the click of a computer mouse. These days we take more delight in the everyday kindnesses, in the shared experience. That, at least, was the thinking behind the artist Michael Landy&apos;s recent project, Acts of Kindness, in which he invited members of the public to submit stories online of kindnesses they had witnessed or been part of while travelling on London Underground. &quot;People can exist in a bubble on the tube,&quot; he explains when we meet for a coffee at the National Gallery. &quot;They&apos;re reading their paper or listening to their MP3 player and everyone is cut off from each other, trying not to make eye contact. It&apos;s partly what you have to do to survive in a city like this, but I was surprised by the response I got. Often we feel that everybody is out for themselves, but that isn&apos;t the case at all.&quot; Landy received countless stories: of women crying after the break-up of a relationship and being offered a smile or a reassuring squeeze, of someone making an origami bird and dropping it into the lap of a person who looked lonely, of strangers helping with heavy luggage. &quot;I was interested in that emotional bridge between self and other,&quot; Landy says. &quot;Every now and then, someone does something kind, and it&apos;s life-enhancing because you&apos;re mixing your emotions with complete strangers.&quot; Back on Carnaby Street, my efforts to mix my emotions with complete strangers are gathering pace. Some people walk past the Guerrilla Huggers with understandable wariness in their eyes. Others \u2013 and it is disproportionately young women in their 20s \u2013 get the idea immediately and hug me without my having to explain. A handful of shop assistants pop out to have a hug in their cigarette break. A Belgian tourist with a camera slung round his neck tells me there should be more of this kind of thing. I get hugged by a nine-year-old boy, a pensioner and a member of the French Olympic boxing team who explains he is very sad after having lost his match. Every single hug makes me smile. I enjoy it far more than I thought I would. As I&apos;m standing there, handing out hugs to people I&apos;ve never met before and will probably never meet again, it strikes me that there&apos;s an obvious irony in the fact that a movement predicated on free gestures of intimacy should have been riven by in-fighting about money between the two men who made it happen. But maybe it doesn&apos;t matter. Like most of the best ideas, Free Hugs has gathered its own momentum. After all, it was always meant to be bigger than just Juan Mann."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/03/hillary-clinton-visit-south-east-asia-china", "publicationDate": "2012-09-03T16:25:00Z", "tags": ["Asia Pacific", "US foreign policy", "China", "World news", "Hillary Clinton"], "sentences": ["The US has formal defence arrangements with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand and Australia, and close security partnerships with Taiwan, Singapore and Indonesia.", "The other main areas of potential confrontation with China are the East China Sea, where Japan is embroiled in long-running disputes, and Taiwan."], "title": "Hillary Clinton won't unite south-east Asia against China", "article": "Faltering US efforts to forge a united front with less powerful Asian countries in the face of an increasingly assertive China have resumed in earnest today with Hillary Clinton&apos;s visit to Indonesia, a leading light of the 10-member Association of South-East Asian nations (Asean) and the world&apos;s most populous majority Muslim country. But the US secretary of state&apos;s arrival in Jakarta was overshadowed by claims that the Obama administration is ignoring worsening political and human rights abuses in its haste to lock Indonesia and states such as Malaysia and Singapore into its 21st century Asia-Pacific strategic vision in which China is strong but constrained. In Washington&apos;s favoured scenario, China becomes a sort of Gulliver-style giant held down and tied in place by feisty multitudes of tiny Lilliputians. What the state department may have forgotten is that, in Jonathan Swift&apos;s tale, Gulliver and his undersized captors reach an uneasy accommodation, then fall out violently. To the US dismay, the last Asean summit, held in Phnom Penh in July, ended in unprecedented confusion after member governments failed to agree a final communique. The Philippines and Vietnam, US allies, wanted to insert a reference to China&apos;s attempts to assert ownership over disputed, possibly oil-rich island territories in the South China Sea. But others were less ready to beard the Beijing behemoth. Cambodia, which hosted the meeting and is heavily dependent on Chinese aid and investment, blocked the proposed text. Now attention is switching to the next Asean summit in Phnom Penh in November. During a meeting in the Cook Islands on Friday with leaders of South Pacific island nations, Clinton pledged to continue helping to maintain security in the region and to protect the flow of maritime commerce. She also called on China to &quot;act in a fair and transparent way&quot; in the Pacific, the Wall Street Journal reported. &quot;We want them to play a positive role in navigation and maritime security issues,&quot; she said. &quot;We want to see them contribute to sustainable development for the people of the Pacific, to protect the precious environment, including the ocean, and to pursue economic activity that will benefit the people.&quot; Some progress has been made on an agreement between Asean and China on a &quot;code of conduct&quot; for managing territorial disputes before they become flashpoints. But Beijing continues to want to deal with such issues bilaterally, while the US believes the Asean countries will be more able to stand up for themselves if they act collectively in multilateral forums. &quot;The most important thing is that we end up in a diplomatic process where these issues are addressed in a strong diplomatic conversation between a unified Asean and China rather than through any kind of coercion,&quot; a senior Clinton official said. US involvement (many in China prefer to call it meddling) has deepened since Barack Obama decided last year to switch attention and resources to the Asia-Pacific region as American commitments in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Europe ebbed. In controversial remarks in Vietnam two years ago, Clinton said freedom of navigation in the South China Sea was a US &quot;national interest&quot;. Clinton has made numerous visits to the region since then. Later this week she will travel to Beijing to raise her concerns directly with China&apos;s leaders. She will also visit Brunei, another Asean member. The US has formal defence arrangements with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand and Australia, and close security partnerships with Taiwan, Singapore and Indonesia. The latter is valued as a Muslim, pro-western business partner and an important counter-terrorism ally. Obama also announced new deployments and facilities in the Philippines and Australia. The other main areas of potential confrontation with China are the East China Sea, where Japan is embroiled in long-running disputes, and Taiwan. Regardless of American assurances, growing fears about China&apos;s long-term intentions are producing tangible changes. &quot;Military budgets are growing rapidly. China&apos;s defence budget will nearly double in three years, south-east Asian countries increased defence spending by an average of 13.5% in 2011, and Asia&apos;s overall military spending will likely outstrip Europe&apos;s for the first time this year,&quot; said Rowan Callick in an article in Foreign Policy entitled Powder Keg in the Pacific. The focus on security is in danger of obscuring other issues. Human Rights Watch said Indonesian authorities had failed adequately to address increasing incidents of mob violence by militant Islamist groups in Java and Sumatra against religious minorities, including the Ahmadiyah, Christians, and Shia Muslims. &quot;Secretary Clinton should press the Indonesian government to take concrete steps to address rising religious intolerance. Indonesia needs to recognise that oppressive laws and policies against religious minorities fuel violence and discrimination,&quot; Human Rights Watch said. Clinton should also quiz her hosts about the detention of nearly 100 political prisoners, HRW suggested. It highlighted the cases of a former Papuan civil servant, Filep Karma, serving a 15-year prison term in Abepura prison, and a Moluccan farmer, Ruben Saiya, serving a 20-year prison term in Nusa Kambangan Island prison."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/japan-china-disputed-islands", "publicationDate": "2012-09-05T14:24:27Z", "tags": ["Japan", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Senkaku Islands"], "sentences": ["The Senkakus are also claimed by Taiwan, but it is the competing assertions of sovereignty by Japan and China that have come to the fore in a summer of territorial tensions in east Asia.", "China has angered its neighbours, including Taiwan and the Philippines, with aggressive claims to islands in the South China Sea."], "title": "Japan stokes tensions with China over plan to buy disputed islands", "article": "Japan has set itself on a possible diplomatic collision course with China after agreeing to buy three islands in the East China Sea that are at the centre of a long-running territorial dispute with Beijing. Japan&apos;s media reported that the government would purchase three islands belonging to the Senkaku chain \u2013 known as Diaoyu in China \u2013 from private Japanese owners for 2.05bn yen (US$26m). The reports drew an angry response in China, which called the move illegal and invalid. &quot;For them to nationalise the Diaoyu islands seriously violates China&apos;s sovereignty and hurts the Chinese people&apos;s feelings,&quot; Hong Lei, a foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters in Beijing. &quot;I stress again that any of their unilateral acts with the Diaoyu islands are illegal and invalid. China&apos;s determination will not change in terms of safeguarding its territory. China is observing the situation and will take necessary measures to defend its sovereignty.&quot; The uninhabited islands, which have been administered by Japan since 1895, attracted Chinese interest in the 1970s after studies suggested they could sit amid potentially huge deposits of oil and natural gas. They are also near vital sea lanes and surrounded by rich fishing grounds. The Senkakus are also claimed by Taiwan, but it is the competing assertions of sovereignty by Japan and China that have come to the fore in a summer of territorial tensions in east Asia. China has angered its neighbours, including Taiwan and the Philippines, with aggressive claims to islands in the South China Sea. Japan, meanwhile, has been locked in a separate disagreement with South Korea over a pair of islands located in the Japan Sea, known as the East Sea among Koreans. The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, raised the possibility of bringing the Senkakus under state control after Tokyo&apos;s nationalist governor, Shintaro Ishihara, launched a controversial campaign in April to buy them. Reports said the government and the owners are expected to sign a contract by the end of the month, following secret negotiations between a senior member of the family and the deputy chief cabinet secretary, Hiroyuki Nagahama. The government had previously leased three of the five islands comprising the chain. &quot;We are negotiating with the owner while we try to grasp where the situation stands between [the central government] and the Tokyo metropolitan government,&quot; said Japan&apos;s chief government spokesman, Osamu Fujimura. An announcement would be made &quot;when we reach a result after completing the process&quot;, he said. The dispute made international headlines in September 2010 when a Chinese fishing vessel collided with two Japanese coastguard vessels near the islands. In an attempt to prevent the row from escalating, Japan released the captain of the fishing boat without charge. Ishihara&apos;s bid to bring the islands under the control of the Tokyo metropolitan government attracted more than 1.4bn yen in donations from the public, and threatened to inflict serious damage to Sino-Japanese ties. Despite the nationalisation plan, Noda appears determined to lower tensions by agreeing not to build a jetty or other facilities on the island. Ishihara, by contrast, had hinted he would approve construction of a weather observatory and dock, adding that the Senkakus needed protecting from Chinese aggression. Ishihara, who has earned a reputation as a China-baiter, said the Senkakus&apos; owners had told him no deal had been finalised, while Tokyo officials said the governor was expected to visit the islands in the coming weeks. The most recent tussle ignited nationalist sentiment in both countries. Japan detained a group of Hong Kong-based activists after they landed on one of the islands last month, and there were protests in several Chinese cities after a group of Japanese nationalists did the same several days later."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/07/apple-iphone-5-music-streaming", "publicationDate": "2012-09-07T15:19:44Z", "tags": ["iPhone 5", "Apple", "iPhone", "Technology", "Mobile phones", "Telecoms", "Telecommunications industry", "Business"], "sentences": ["Apple collects 71% of the world&apos;s smartphone profits, analysts reckon; Even though Samsung ships the most phones, it takes 37%; Taiwan&apos;s HTC gets 1%."], "title": "Apple's 'iPhone 5': will music streaming be the surprise extra?", "article": "Even before Apple has announced the name or the shape of its next iPhone \u2014 expected to be unveiled by chief executive Tim Cook next Wednesday \u2014 analysts are certain that it is going to dominate the Christmas market in the US and, to a lesser extent, Europe. &quot;Our target is for Apple to sell 50m iPhones in the fourth quarter, of which 28m will be the iPhone 5,&quot; said Neil Mawston, executive director of research firm Strategy Analytics. That compares with 37m iPhones in total in the same period a year before, of which Mawston reckons 20m were the then-new iPhone 4S. As ever with Apple product launches, expectations are running high. The breadth of its supply chain means the once Kremlin-like secrecy around iPhone launches has become sieve-like: there is certainty that the &quot;iPhone 5&quot; will have a larger, longer screen, thinner design, smaller SIM card, bigger battery and new connector; it is also expected to offer high-speed 4G/LTE wireless broadband, a step up from the 3G first added to the iPhone in 2008. What isn&apos;t known is what the &quot;rabbit in the hat&quot; \u2014 the surprise extra \u2014 will be. Two years ago it was the high-quality &quot;retina&quot; display; last year, the &quot;Siri&quot; voice recognition system. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if they come up with some kind of service that differentiates them from the rest and which consumers value,&quot; says Francisco Jeronimo, smartphones analyst for researchers IDC. The latest reports suggest some sort of music-streaming service, at least in the US, to rival Spotify and Pandora; others suggest the next iPhone will have NFC, a short-range data transmission technology that could be used for mobile payments. Apple has declined to comment. Getting the iPhone right has become crucial for the Californian company which is now the biggest business the world has ever seen, valued at some $628bn (\u00a3393bn). The product generates just under half Apple&apos;s revenues, and a significant chunk of its massive profits. Any misstep would be disastrous. Next week&apos;s model will also be the first launched without Steve Jobs&apos;s imprimatur \u2014 the Apple co-founder tested last year&apos;s iPhone 4S and its key feature, the voice-driven assistant &quot;Siri&quot;, despite his terminal cancer \u2014 and thus a key test for Cook and the company he has been running since August 2011. Analysts feel so far he has kept it stable. &quot;It&apos;s still heading upwards,&quot; says Mawston. No analyst sees any sign of a misstep yet \u2014 though Cook is not the showman Jobs was, and leaves the presentations to Phil Schiller, the long-time head of marketing, and Scott Forstall, the rising star who heads the iPhone and iPad software divisions. Others suggest Apple could continue for years before the weaknesses emerge and undermine it \u2014 as happened at other companies with strong leaders, such as Sony and Disney. There&apos;s no sign of weakness for now. Apple collects 71% of the world&apos;s smartphone profits, analysts reckon; Even though Samsung ships the most phones, it takes 37%; Taiwan&apos;s HTC gets 1%. (That total exceeds 100% because it&apos;s offset by losses at Nokia, BlackBerry-maker RIM, Motorola, Sony, LG and others.) The sector is dominated though by phones using Google&apos;s Android system: in the second quarter of this year, 68% of the 153m smartphones shipped worldwide used Android, according to Francisco Jeronimo, smartphones analyst at IDC. Apple&apos;s collection of just three models \u2014 the 4S, 4 and 3GS \u2014 made up 17%. &quot;But there are so many Android phones!&quot; exclaims Jeronimo. &quot;I counted on our database \u2014 950 different devices in that quarter. For Windows Phone [using Microsoft&apos;s mobile software] it&apos;s 63, and for BlackBerry it&apos;s a little more.&quot; What that means for the customer walking into a phone shop, he says, is confusion: &quot;They look at the price, and the design, and look for a brand they&apos;ve heard of.&quot; Apple has built its brand into something that users trust for a reliable, simple experience, he says. &quot;It&apos;s seen as the best and easiest user experience in the market.&quot; For rivals such as Nokia and Google-owned Motorola, which earlier this week held their own events to show off their new handsets, the attention that Apple garners for its single releases each year must be galling. Nokia, once the world&apos;s biggest mobile phone business, is no slouch, showing off two new models with innovations such as touchscreens that work with gloves and wireless charging \u2014 no connectors necessary. Motorola, which created the mobile phone business, had three devices, with almost edge-to-edge screens. Benedict Evans of Enders Analysis says though that adding features isn&apos;t enough. &quot;Apple doesn&apos;t put a technology into a product without knowing what people are going to do with it. There wasn&apos;t a front-facing camera until there was also a video-calling service [called FaceTime].&quot; Can Apple go on, though, releasing just one phone a year? By doing so it is making its sales more and more cyclical, says Evans, as buyers hold off for the next version. Jeronimo says: &quot;I have had this discussion with Apple. They say &apos;do we need to increase the number of phones we make, or have the best-in-class experience?&apos;&quot; Jeronimo says: &quot;Look at what Samsung is doing. It&apos;s trying to compete in every market segment, and they will lead in every market. But even Samsung is changing its strategy. It&apos;s sold 20m units of its [flagship] Galaxy S3 phone in 100 days, which is very impressive.&quot; You could think that Samsung only offers the one phone from its advertising, he suggests, rather than the scores it really does: &quot;Having a strong message and advert around one device pays. Samsung is starting to do that.&quot; Evans wonders whether Apple might begin fighting its bitter rival on lower-priced ground. &quot;The average selling price [to carriers] of the iPhone is over $600; most Android phones sell for about $150, though the average is increased by Samsung and HTC to around $250. Nothing that has happened is going to shift that unless Apple starts selling different products at a lower price.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/sep/11/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2012-09-11T05:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "sentences": ["For the first eight months of 2012, revenues amounted to NT$207.87bn, decreasing 34.8% from a year earlier, according to a company filing with the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE)."], "title": "Boot up: Apache's track patch, Windows 8 supplies, GRiD remembered and more", "article": "A quick burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Apache patch to override IE 10&apos;s Do Not Track setting &gt;&gt; ParityNews.com: ...Because Technology Matters  A new patch for Apache by Roy Fielding, one of the authors of the Do Not Track (DNT) standard, is set to override the DNT option if the browser reaching the server is Internet Explorer 10.

The first batch of Windows 8-based notebooks was shipped in late August via marine routes and were all models without touchscreen panels. For models equipped with touchscreen panels, ODMs are still in the processes of conducting final adjustments and debugging, and finished products are only expected start shipping in late September by air.   When Digitimes writes about pure supply chain issues, it&apos;s usually right on the money. New broadband minister snubs &apos;ugly&apos; fibre cabinet gripes &gt;&gt; The Register  Brits will no longer be able to object to the arrival of &quot;ghastly&quot; fibre optic cabling cabinets outside their homes: Blighty&apos;s new broadband minister has stamped her authority on moves to upgrade the nation&apos;s internet infrastructure that sidestep local councils.  Maria Miller, who replaced Jeremy Hunt earlier this week during Prime Minister David Cameron&apos;s reshuffle, said she planned to legislate immediately following consultation, and added the government would - if necessary - use existing powers to put an end to local bureaucracy that she thinks is slowing down the rollout of faster broadband.   Have any fibre installations been stopped because of planning objections? GRiD Compass 1101 computer &gt;&gt; Old Computers  Designed to be the ultimate portable computer, the clamshell-style GRiD Compass 1101 is the grand-daddy of all present-day laptop computers.  The Compass is very high-tech, with its flat-black, die-cast magnesium-alloy case, and bright, sharp electroluminescent display (ELD). No other system packed so much speed and power in as small a case, and none had such a unique and large, easy-to-read screen, allowing full 80x24 text.  Of course, all of these great features raised the price significantly. At $8150, the GRiD Compass 1101 was the most expensive personal computer you could buy.  Originally developed for business executives, GRiDs were also used by the U.S. military &apos;in the field&apos;, and by NASA on the Space Shuttles during the 1980&apos;s and 90&apos;s. It&apos;s even been said that the US President&apos;s &quot;nuclear football&quot; at one time included a GRiD computer.   RIP Bill Moggridge. The ho-hum era of smartphones has begun &gt;&gt; CNET News Stephen Shankland:   There&apos;s a precedent here: personal computers. For years, it&apos;s been hard to stand out in that realm, with largely interchangeable designs made of of the same innards sourced from the same suppliers. Apple stands out for its sturdy laptops, slick track pad, and in-house operating system, but it&apos;s the exception that proves the rule for the much larger remainder of the market.  Occasionally, dramatic change sweeps through the personal computer world, and I think Windows 8 and touch screens are driving one of those big changes now. It remains to be seen whether consumers will embrace the changes, of course, but there&apos;s no doubt many of next year&apos;s PCs will be very different from last year&apos;s PCs.

It is iconic, consistent, and easily identifiable.  Now perhaps those engaging in the &quot;you can&apos;t patent round corners&quot; debate have either no appreciation for consistent design philosophy or never taken a step back and looked at all of Apple&apos;s products. Because when one does take a look at all of Apple&apos;s products you will see that every piece of hardware follows the four perfectly asymmetrical rounded corners design.  HTC revenues down for fourth straight month in August  HTC has reported revenues of NT$24.02bn (US$803.34m) for August 2012, down 4% sequentially and 47% on year. The data shows that HTC&apos;s revenues have been declining for four consecutive months.  For the first eight months of 2012, revenues amounted to NT$207.87bn, decreasing 34.8% from a year earlier, according to a company filing with the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE).   Expects to break that in September following Asian launches, but this does not look healthy for HTC. Those are very large decreases in revenue in this market.

He says that recent retail checks show not only a significant decline in BlackBerry inventory, but shelf space pressure and lackluster sales as well.  &quot;Our sell-through checks in the United States indicate that BlackBerry sales were largely unchanged in August versus July; however, we detected meaningfully lower inventory levels versus a month ago,&quot; Faucette explains. &quot;In terms of sell-through, we believe that current run rates are roughly one-fifth of those we saw in the United States just eight months ago. Further, we found a meaningful number of carrier retail locations which had not sold a single BlackBerry in over a month.&quot;   That is a very serious problem if broadly repeated.

How Google builds its maps - and what It means for the future of everything &gt;&gt; The Atlantic  Volmar has clearly spent thousands of hours working with this data. Weiss-Malik told me that it takes hundreds of operators to map a country. (Rumor has it many of these people work in the Bangalore office, out of which Gupta was promoted.)  The sheer amount of human effort that goes into Google&apos;s maps is just mind-boggling. Every road that you see slightly askew in the top image has been hand-massaged by a human. The most telling moment for me came when we looked at couple of the several thousand user reports of problems with Google Maps that come in every day. The Geo team tries to address the majority of fixable problems within minutes. One complaint reported that Google did not show a new roundabout that had been built in a rural part of the country. The satellite imagery did not show the change, but a Street View car had recently driven down the street and its tracks showed the new road perfectly.   In effect we&apos;re beyond the 1:1 map.

Fascinating detective story - though there are disquieting little elements, like that one. Nexus 7 not yet allowed to enter China market &gt;&gt; Digitimes  While the Nexus 7, the tablet co-developed by Google and Taiwan-based vendor Asustek Computer, has been witnessing booming sales in major markets around the world, it is difficult for the model to be available for sale in the China market because the China government has not yet approved its import, according to industry sources in Taiwan....  Without the China market, the cumulative global sales volume of Nexus 7 will reach an estimated 3.5m units at the end of 2012, the sources noted.   The problems of being made by a Taiwanese company?

Tasker for Android &gt;&gt; Dinglisch.net Some people on the &quot;things I&apos;d like to see in iOS&quot; hadn&apos;t heard of Android&apos;s Tasker, which lets you tie together strings of actions using Android&apos;s intents. Presented here as a public service. (Android users only, obviously.) Impact of iOS &amp; Android on the PC replacement cycle &gt;&gt; tech-thoughts.net  From the chart above, we can see that modern mobile device shipments together exhibit an 89% correlation with the PC replacement cycle for a given year. This means that as mobile device shipments have grown, consumers have resisted upgrading their PCs more and more. However, this still does not prove that there is a causal relationship between the two.   He then, however, goes on to show that the chances of it not being causal are very, very low. Apple&apos;s next IPhone seen adding to fourth-quarter US growth &gt;&gt; Bloomberg  The iPhone model to be introduced this week is expected to be &quot;much larger&quot; than last year&apos;s device, he said. Feroli, who is JPMorgan&apos;s chief U.S. economist, is predicting the U.S. economy will expand about 2 percent in the fourth quarter, with the iPhone limiting &quot;downside risk.&quot; Still, he cautioned that his estimates should be &quot;treated skeptically.&quot;   Brought to you by Flying Pig News.

Google Wins Major Antitrust Victory In Brazil, Does It Foreshadow Broader EU &amp; US Wins? Very encouraging result for Google.   Basically what the court said was the following:  Despite Google&apos;s overwhelming search market share, Buscap\u00e9 [the plaintiff&apos;s] shopping sites have other ways to be found. Google isn&apos;t a monopoly.  Google&apos;s vertical results aren&apos;t competitive &quot;products,&quot; they&apos;re just a part of Google&apos;s search results  Google owes no duty to present plaintiff&apos;s site(s) in a particular position; Google can present search results in whatever manner and order it deems best for its users.   The key distinction - which might become germane in the US and Europe - is that Google isn&apos;t a monopoly; it&apos;s the leader. (Thanks @modelportfolio2003 for the link.)

The next day, Wen Jiabao, the premier, spoke at a ceremony to unveil statues of Zhou Enlai, the first premier of the People&apos;s Republic, and Chen Yi, who took over as foreign minister from Zhou. He said: &quot;Old China was totally humiliated, its territories were fragmented \u2026 The older generation of revolutionaries like Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and Chen Yi founded the People&apos;s Republic and ended a hundred years of humiliation in our recent national history, laying the foundation of new China&apos;s foreign relations. We must for ever remember their magnificent achievements, and study, carry on and develop their intellectual and spiritual qualities&quot;. The day after that speech the Japanese government signed a deal to begin to &quot;nationalise&quot; the Senkaku islands, known as Diaoyu in China. The Chinese government strongly objected, and sent surveillance ships to the disputed waters. Popular feelings also ran high: anti-Japan demonstrations have spread across China, including Hong Kong. Taiwan&apos;s veteran &quot;defending Diaoyu movement&quot; has been boosted by implicit official support. Larger mass rallies could occur on Tuesday, the anniversary of the 1931 Japanese invasion in northern China. However, interpreting Wen&apos;s words and the mass protests in China&apos;s streets as simply nationalistic would miss the point. Rather, as the leaders well know, accumulated social discontent with a regime seen by many as externally weak and internally corrupt has found expression in maritime disputes between China and its neighbours. Some of the signs used in the anti-Japan demonstrations address domestic policies: there were even a few forbidden ones, with reference to the crushed Chongqing model. Many protesters carry Mao&apos;s portrait. Voices from the top and bottom of Chinese society have coincided here to call for a return to common sense. Wen, by reputation the most &quot;liberal&quot; among the party&apos;s political factions, was speaking about the need to honour modern China&apos;s roots in the epic liberation struggle of the Chinese people. In the eyes of ordinary Chinese, the People&apos;s Republic has moved far from its founding promises of popular power and wellbeing, &quot;rising&quot; through hyper-growth, frenzied urbanisation and single-minded global integration, with grave moral, social and environmental costs: losing its soul while expanding economically. Continuities and ruptures are both evident in a comparison of the Maoist and post-Mao eras. Deng Xiaoping, who belonged to the first communist generation, led China&apos;s market transition immediately after the cultural revolution. The 1980s saw general living standards rise and 400 million peasants lifted out of poverty. Despite such pragmatic slogans as &quot;getting rich first&quot;, Deng warned against the danger of income polarisation:  &quot;If we allow the millionaires to emerge one day, our reform project would fail.&quot;  Yet, by a powerful market logic, and in the absence of determined political intervention, China did produce millionaires and later even billionaires. It became one of the world&apos;s most unequal societies. Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, handpicked by Deng as successive party general secretaries, loyally carried out the Dengist programme of &quot;reform and opening&quot;. They were still idealistic communists in their respective ways and did not survive the events around the upheavals in Tiananmen Square in 1989. However, many subsequent policies, such as the integration of coastal China into the global economy and export-led growth, were set in motion. Instead of tackling the urgent problems of corruption and rising social insecurity that contributed to the Tiananmen upheavals, the Jiang Zemin-Zhu Rongji leadership selected by Deng radicalised an initially socialist reform of self-adjustment. After the post-1992 resumption of &quot;development as the absolute principle&quot; (Deng), they pushed for industrial privatisation, introduced stock and real estate markets, and negotiated China&apos;s accession into the World Trade Organisation with excessive concessions. Jiang also paved the way for the Communist party to change colour. As 40 million urban workers were laid off and rural communal management collapsed, the second reform phase turned out to be an all-out neoliberal adventure. Since then the astonishing wealth and lifestyles of some cadres and families have become common knowledge. Officials keeping overseas bank accounts, or fleeing the country with bags of cash, fuelled popular indignation and political cynicism. It was hoped that Hu Jintao, the president, and Wen \u2013 appointed with Deng&apos;s approval \u2013 would clean up the mess. They proposed a &quot;scientific conception of development&quot; and a platform of people-first social policies, removing agricultural taxes and school fees for compulsory education, and working on rebuilding public medicine and social security. However, they also forced property laws on the legislature to legitimise privatisation, and stuck to a GDP-centered strategy. China is trapped in the developmentalist predicament of exploitative cheap labour, undue energy consumption, heavy pollution and foreign trade dependency. With an excess surplus capital, China&apos;s outgoing investments have also run into difficulties and tensions abroad. During Hu and Wen&apos;s tenure \u2013 like that of their reformist predecessors \u2013 market supremacy has relied on state sponsorship or imposition, at times violently. Senseless commercialisation in Tibet and Xinjiang, with intended and unintended social, cultural and demographic consequences, caused deadly clashes. With hopes for the third &quot;reform decade&quot; dashed, China&apos;s vulnerable feel the pain: the land-losing peasants; the struggling migrants and the children and elderly and sick people they left behind; and, in the end, angry strikers, petitioners and protesters. As the economy falls into a slump, the government seems to have followed every step of recent World Bank recommendations. In this month&apos;s Apec summit, Hu reaffirmed China&apos;s commitment to further trade and financial liberalisation. China&apos;s post-Deng power transitions have so far been largely smooth. The processes have been modernised, with more extensive voting opportunities and consultation. The leaders at all levels have become younger and better educated, but the system still hinders able, independent candidates, and tends to promote the mediocre and obedient. Due to the fall of Bo Xilai in the Chongqing crisis, we already know that there will be no seamless power transition this year. The unexplained absence of Xi Jinping only added to the uncertainty. The total secrecy of politics at the top hurts the system itself by showing its lack of self-confidence and a deep distrust of citizens. This will have to be addressed by the new leaders. As things stand, it is difficult to anticipate any decisive change in China&apos;s political economy. Yet there are multiple factors at work: the logic of the market and the logic of bureaucracy \u2013 but ultimately also the logic of politics. Xi and Li Keqiang, the assigned premier, have been appointed through rounds of internal elections and negotiations. They should be aware of popular demands, and social movements, and become committed to political transparency and, indeed, democracy. And we may also expect them to tackle corruption, so as to rescue the regime for their own survival. They could begin with publicising the earnings and family incomes of national leaders and highly placed officials. They need also to revert to the minimal communist ethic of serving the people. \u2022 This article was amended at 10.30pm (UK time) on 17 September, after a partially edited version was published in error"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/19/china-japan-senkaku-diaoyu-islands", "publicationDate": "2012-09-19T12:09:50Z", "tags": ["Senkaku Islands", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan", "China", "Xi Jinping"], "sentences": ["According to the South China Morning Post, Jiao was detained over open letters he posted online to Ma Ying-jeou, president of Taiwan, and the nationalist Tokyo governor, Shintaro Ishihara, whose proposal to buy the Diaoyu islands triggered the Japanese government&apos;s purchase."], "title": "Japan's purchase of disputed islands is a farce, says China's next leader", "article": "China&apos;s leader-in-waiting Xi Jinping has weighed in on the country&apos;s dispute with Japan by condemning the purchase of contested islands in the East China Sea as a farce, according to state media. The vice-president, expected to take charge when power is handed to a younger generation of leaders this autumn, urged Japan to stop &quot;wrong behaviours&quot;, official news agency Xinhua added. Four days of large-scale and sometimes violent protests in cities across China appeared to have reached their conclusion on Tuesday, the anniversary of the 1931 incident that launched Japan&apos;s occupation of northern China. Authorities strengthened their presence in protest areas and made it clear further demonstrations would not be tolerated. The island group, known to China as the Diaoyu and to Japan as the Senkaku, is surrounded by fisheries and environmental resources, but the conflict is also fuelled by historical grievances over Japanese brutality in the 1930s and 1940s. The Japanese mission sent an email to China-based citizens, saying: &quot;It seems the protests in front of our embassy have subsided.&quot; It cited a message from Beijing police urging people not to protest in the embassy district. Beijing government workers cleaned paintbomb stains from around the building, and many Japanese businesses and factories reopened. But China&apos;s commerce ministry spokesman, Shen Danyang, warned that the dispute would harm bilateral trade, which exceeded \u00a3210bn last year. &quot;Japan must take complete responsibility for this,&quot; he added. Professor Hu Xingdou of the Beijing Institute of Technology warned: &quot;The Diaoyu island issue cannot be solved in the short term \u2026 it will be an obstacle to the friendship between China and Japan.&quot; He said he believed this wave of protests had been bigger and more violent than the anti-Japanese demonstrations of 2005. While protesters mostly vented their frustrations on Japanese properties or products \u2013 attacking businesses and smashing up cars \u2013 the Hong Kong government reported an assault against a Japanese couple in its region and urged the public to respect the law. Around 50 protesters in Beijing also attacked the car of US ambassador Gary Locke on Tuesday, said embassy spokesman Nolan Barkhouse. &quot;Embassy officials have registered their concern about yesterday&apos;s incident with the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs and urged the Chinese government to do everything possible to protect American facilities and personnel,&quot; he added. The visiting US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, sought to allay Chinese concerns over the US&apos;s new focus on the Asia-Pacific region, shortly after meeting Xi on Wednesday. He told young Chinese officers and cadets: &quot;Our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region is not an attempt to contain China. It is an attempt to engage China and expand its role in the Pacific. It is about creating a new model in the relationship of two Pacific powers.&quot; Chinese rights groups have reported that a well-known dissident is being held by police after posting comments about the disputed islands last week. Jiao Guobiao, formerly a journalism professor at Peking University, was arrested for incitement to subvert state power. According to the South China Morning Post, Jiao was detained over open letters he posted online to Ma Ying-jeou, president of Taiwan, and the nationalist Tokyo governor, Shintaro Ishihara, whose proposal to buy the Diaoyu islands triggered the Japanese government&apos;s purchase. In his letter to Ishihara, Jiao wrote satirically that he would donate money to help Japan buy the Diaoyu islands and even the Zhongnanhai leadership compound in Beijing. His letter to Ma said that if the islands were owned by Beijing, &quot;they will become another pig sty where it can arbitrarily carry out abuses&quot;.. In Japan, police said they believed a small fire at the gates of a Chinese school in Kobe was set because of the dispute."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/19/android-china-alibaba-acer-strain", "publicationDate": "2012-09-19T20:58:00Z", "tags": ["Android", "Google", "China", "Apps", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Technology", "Internet", "Acer"], "sentences": ["Google&apos;s intervention to stop Acer launching a smartphone with search rival Alibaba&apos;s &quot;forked&quot; version of Android is reportedly causing tension with Taiwanese and Chinese handset makers - and might even threaten Android&apos;s unity in China.", "But Digitimes, the Taiwan-based news site for the IT supply chain there and in China, says there is unease on the part of a number of ODMs (original device manufacturers) who would otherwise aim to benefit from making both Android-compatible and forked versions - the latter principally aimed at China."], "title": "Why Google's clash with Acer and Alibaba strains China's Android market", "article": "Google&apos;s intervention to stop Acer launching a smartphone with search rival Alibaba&apos;s &quot;forked&quot; version of Android is reportedly causing tension with Taiwanese and Chinese handset makers - and might even threaten Android&apos;s unity in China. The search giant lobbied Acer last week to halt its scheduled press showing of a new smartphone aimed at the Chinese market, pointing out that membership of the Open Handset Alliance - the group of companies forming the device, carrier, semiconductor, software and &quot;commercialisation&quot; sides of the Android ecosystem - forbids Acer from making devices that offer forked, or incompatible, versions of Android.  Acer cancelled the launch abruptly, leaving Alibaba fuming publicly at Google&apos;s actions. John Spelich, Alibaba&apos;s international spokesman, told CNet that &quot;Aliyun is different&quot; from Android - dismissing remarks aimed at him by Andy Rubin, head of Google&apos;s mobile efforts including Android, saying to Spelich that &quot;Aliyun uses the Android runtime, framework and tools. And your app store contains Android apps (including pirated Google apps).&quot; The upshot has been that Acer has withdrawn from the partnership with Alibaba, at least for now. But Digitimes, the Taiwan-based news site for the IT supply chain there and in China, says there is unease on the part of a number of ODMs (original device manufacturers) who would otherwise aim to benefit from making both Android-compatible and forked versions - the latter principally aimed at China.  Some of the China-based smartphone vendors which are building Android-based phone and have adopted locally developed application might shift to forked versions because &quot;the loss from forgoing Android may be small,&quot; the site reports, quoting its supply chain sources.  With Alibaba, one of the biggest web destinations in China, seeking to build its own fork of Android - rather as Amazon has done in the US - Google might face a challenge from its own creation in the market where it needs unity. Rubin indicated some of Google&apos;s concern, saying in a Google+ post that &quot;We were surprised to read Alibaba Group&apos;s chief strategy officer Zeng Ming&apos;s quote &apos;We want to be the Android of China&apos; when in fact the Aliyun OS incorporates the Android runtime and was apparently derived from Android.&quot;  But Ming&apos;s meaning is clear - that Alibaba wants to dominate the Chinese smartphone OS landscape just as Android does the world&apos;s. However for Google, it is important to keep Android unified around the OHA in China so that it can continue to serve Android handsets - whose activations are now running at over a miilion per day - with search results and, in time, garner advertising revenue. If Android splits into multiple competing varieties which do not all use Google for search, maps and other key functions, Google will have lost out. The next paragraph of the Digitimes report carries a heavier warning to the company about the risks inherent in the market: &quot;Among China-based smartphone vendors, only Huawei Technologies, ZTE, Lenovo, Haier, Oppo and a few others joined the Open Handset Alliance, the sources noted. As China is the largest smartphone market around the world, Google had better pay attention to [the] response from web service operators, smartphone vendors and consumers, the sources pointed out.&quot; The challenge for Google is that China is the fastest-growing smartphone market in the world, and expected to be the world&apos;s largest - ahead of the US - this year.  Android powers a huge number of the smartphones sold there: according to figures provided to the Guardian by research company Gartner, in the second quarter of this year 80% of the smartphones sold in China ran Android - or 30.6m out of 38.2m, going by the shipment figures provided for the same quarter by another research company, Analysys International. That means that Android is far more used in China than broadly around the world, where it made up 65% of shipments in the second quarter according to Gartner. Analysys said that China&apos;s smartphone business more than doubled year-on-year, up 127%, and increased sequentially by 22.5% - much faster than the world market, where year-on-year growth was only 43%. Forecasts suggest that the Chinese smartphone market will total 430m in 2012, led by Samsung, with Apple in second place - but with Android handsets from Samsung, Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo, Coolpad, Motorola, Xiaomi, HTC and dozens of others making up most of the balance.  While Google is benefiting enormously in China from the dominance of Samsung, and the presence of other OHA members, a growing number of &quot;white box&quot; handset makers are focussed almost entirely on the Chinese market - and so will gravitate to the biggest app markets, even if they are not completely compatible with Google&apos;s Android. There are already multiple Android app markets in China, with varying degrees of legitimacy.  Alibaba&apos;s efforts with Aliyun, which exploits the open nature of Android to build its own OS version and app store - in the same way as Amazon has - point to the power that strong local brand names have. The attraction of those app markets could as they grow drive a wedge between OHA members keeping world compatibility, and the local players with a keener focus on their home market, which will soon be the world&apos;s biggest. In time, that could mean that the emergence of a successful China-only app market based around a fork of Android that might be so enticing - and lucrative - that it would pull one or more of the OHA members to abandon the group, or at least weaken its unity - as nearly happened with Acer.  In his Google+ post, Rubin lobbed some barbed comments at Alibaba, apparently warning it off courting Acer: &quot;if you want to benefit from the Android ecosystem, then make the choice to be compatible. It&apos;s easy, free, and we&apos;ll even help you out. But if you don&apos;t want to be compatible, then don&apos;t expect help from OHA members that are all working to support and build a unified Android ecosystem.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/20/new-zealand-lukewarm-leon-panetta", "publicationDate": "2012-09-20T13:20:40Z", "tags": ["New Zealand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "US politics", "US news"], "sentences": ["The prospect that, on this basis, New Zealand might one day be drawn into a Sino-American military confrontation over disputed Japanese islands such as the Senkakus, or Taiwan, or North Korea, is alarming to many, and rightly so, for it can hardly be said to serve the national interest."], "title": "Leon Panetta gets a lukewarm welcome in New Zealand | Simon Tisdall", "article": "New Zealand was afforded a rare honour on Thursday \u2013 a visit by Leon Panetta, the first American defence secretary to visit the country since Caspar Weinberger back in the cold war days of 1982. But some local inhabitants seem a tad ungrateful. They have labelled Panetta, a former CIA chief, the &quot;warlord of the world&quot; and say he should be arrested and sent for trial in The Hague. They pay no heed to Washington&apos;s &quot;anti-China&quot; Asia-Pacific security agenda. On balance, it always seemed unlikely Panetta would be handcuffed and led away. But he should tread carefully, all the same. New Zealand surprised and deeply angered Washington in the mid-1980s when the government of David Lange famously banned the presence of nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered ships from New Zealand&apos;s waters. The Reagan administration retaliated by suspending defence co-operation. The tripartite Anzus pact with the US and Australia lost its third leg. New Zealand&apos;s independent spirit remains undimmed. But political and security relations with the US have recovered in recent years, driven primarily by Washington&apos;s growing focus on Asia-Pacific in general, and China in particular. This has produced some significant joint initiatives, as Robert Ayson, director of the Centre for Strategic Studies at Victoria University, noted. &quot;We had the Wellington Declaration in 2010 where the government [of prime minister John Key] and the Obama administration committed themselves to co-operating more in the south Pacific. New Zealand has joined US humanitarian missions in this region. We have also had US marines and army personnel training in New Zealand,&quot; Ayson wrote. This rapprochement culminated this year with the Washington Declaration on building up a joint maritime security presence and deployable capabilities. Ayson warned: &quot;We&apos;ve even said, in language not too far from Anzus, that we are prepared to respond &apos;in accordance with national approval processes&apos; to regional contingencies. And we don&apos;t just mean the Pacific. The canvas is the wider Asia-Pacific region. That means New Zealand is more likely to be seen as a participant in America&apos;s rebalancing in Asia.&quot; This is also how it is seen in Washington. &quot;The central purpose of the secretary&apos;s visit is to explore opportunities for deepening defence co-operation. Following the Washington Declaration, a key area of focus is likely to be maritime military issues in the west Pacific,&quot; said a briefing prepared by the Center For Strategic &amp; International Studies. The prospect that, on this basis, New Zealand might one day be drawn into a Sino-American military confrontation over disputed Japanese islands such as the Senkakus, or Taiwan, or North Korea, is alarming to many, and rightly so, for it can hardly be said to serve the national interest. New Zealand&apos;s relations with Beijing are cordial and China is its largest trading partner after Australia, said New Zealand Herald columnist Brian Rudman, so why play Panetta&apos;s game? He said: &quot;Turn off the lights. Hide behind the curtains. Pretend we&apos;re visiting sick rellies [relatives] in Sydney. The warlord of the world, Leon Panetta, slips into Auckland this week \u2026 Panetta is here to try and sign New Zealand up to his team trying to encircle and contain the rampant dragon that is China.&quot; He continued: &quot;When you look at the devastation that is Iraq and Afghanistan and the upheavals throughout the Muslim world and read of US unmanned Predator and Reaper drone aircraft bombing village wedding parties by remote control, is this a &apos;friend&apos; or &apos;valued partner&apos; we really want to get any closer to? We joined them in the Vietnam calamity, and the Afghanistan debacle. Now they want us to join them in putting some sort of corset around China ... It&apos;s nice of Panetta to drop in. But the price he asks is too high.&quot; Panetta travelled to New Zealand after a three-day visit to China, where he toured Chinese warships and gave assurances that Washington wants a non-confrontational relationship based on trust and respect. But commentators point out that as US-China regional rivalry grows, pressure from both countries to take their side in future disputes will inevitably grow, too \u2013 and New Zealand cannot satisfy both. Better in that case to pursue a balanced policy rather than tilting towards Washington. Complaints also persist that the US has not broken a habit of bullying that dates back to the nuclear dispute (the nuclear ban remains in force). While New Zealand took part in recent US-led, 22-country naval exercises off Hawaii, its ships, the Te Kaha and Endeavour, were not allowed to berth in Pearl Harbour alongside the other participants \u2013 a painful snub. &quot;We need to strongly oppose the fact that our government is sucking up to the USA because we are too small to have any great influence and need to preserve our values and our sovereignty,&quot; said blogger &quot;Mariana P&quot; in response to Ayson&apos;s article. Some New Zealanders would go further. Another blogger, &quot;tjh&quot;, wrote: &quot;Panetta was deeply involved in the illegal Iraq war \u2013 and in the CIA&apos;s rendition, torture, and illegal imprisonment activities. He should be arrested the moment he steps on to our soil and referred to the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.

HTC, which has been struggling with falling revenues as it competes in the Android handset market with dominant maker Samsung, said that the phones will be available from November across multiple carriers around the world. The two HTC handsets \u2013 the Windows Phone 8X and the Windows Phone 8S \u2013 will pit it directly against Nokia, which earlier this month also launched two colourful Windows Phone models. Both companies have been held back from putting their handsets on sale or announcing prices at once because Microsoft has not formally announced the Windows Phone 8 software; that will not happen until the end of October, alongside the launch of the new Windows 8 desktop and tablet operating system. Like Nokia, HTC is under pressure to generate strong sales from its next round of phones after losing significant ground to Samsung and Apple, which together make up half of all smartphone shipments worldwide. With Apple boasting 2m pre-orders of its new iPhone 5 before it hits store shelves on 21September, Reticle Research analyst Ross Rubin said it will be challenging for HTC to catch up. But HTC, which has generated most of its sales from phones based on Google&apos;s Android software in recent years, will be able to count on marketing help from Microsoft. The new devices will be marketed as the &quot;signature&quot; Windows Phone 8 smartphones, Jason Mackenzie, HTC&apos;s global head of sales, told attendees at the company&apos;s New York launch event, at which Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer also came on stage. &quot;Consumers are going to love these phones, and we&apos;re committed to reaching them in a manner that&apos;s clear and direct,&quot; Ballmer said. But that clearly annoyed Nokia, whose sales and marketing chief Chris Weber tweeted that &quot;it takes more than matching colour to match the innovation of the Lumia 920&quot; \u2013 referring to the recently announced high-end models in multiple colours announced by his chief executive Stephen Elop in New York. Shares of HTC climbed as much as 2% in early trading in Taipei. Some fund managers were wary of the sales appeal of HTC&apos;s new Windows phones in the fourth quarter, despite their good designs and form factors, as the market share of the Microsoft&apos;s operating system remains small. &quot;Even with the rumored new Android models coming up, HTC&apos;s performance will be so-so this year, because its phones are still lagging behind Samsung,&quot; said Michael On, a managing director of Beyond Asset Management in Taipei, which does not own HTC shares. The success of HTC and Nokia Windows Phone 8 devices this holiday shopping season will be crucial to Microsoft, which has been left far behind by Apple and Google in the smartphone software market in the last several years. Gartner analyst Michael Gartenberg said HTC and Nokia were smart to distinguish the appearance of their devices from Apple&apos;s iPhone with bright colours, as it could make them stand out to customers who want an iPhone alternative. &quot;The best thing about these device ranges is that neither looks like an iPhone,&quot; said Gartenberg, adding that competition between Nokia and HTC will also help to generate some publicity around Windows Phone 8 software. Taiwan&apos;s HTC was able to share more signs of success at its device launch event in New York than did Nokia at its phone launch here earlier this month. While Nokia did not name any customers for its latest Lumia phones, HTC said that together its two new phones would go on sale at 150 operators in 50 countries around the world. For example, it said that either the 8X or the 8S will go on sale at three of the top four US mobile operators \u2013 Verizon Wireless , AT&amp;T Inc and T-Mobile USA . Until now, HTC has been betting on its One series of phones, but so far this year their sales have failed to keep pace with the growth in shipments of Apple&apos;s iPhone and Samsung&apos;s Galaxy range. Up to the second half of 2011, HTC, a former contract smartphone maker, had built a strong brand around the world with phones based on Android software. But it suddenly suffered a sharp decline in its fortunes, as first Samsung and then Apple moved into overdrive. HTC&apos;s profits more than halved in the second quarter of 2012 compared with 2011, and it also warned of a revenue decline of as much as 23% in the third quarter from the previous three months due to macroeconomic problems and competition.

They played on a special board hand-drawn by schoolboy William, and - surprisingly - William won. Now Google has supported a special Turing Centenary Monopoly Board based on William&apos;s, sold exclusively by the museum at Bletchley Park where Turing worked on breaking Nazi codes. It looks beautiful; I have ordered two sets already. Last Wednesday on Twitter Stephen Fry enthused:  A magnificent 2012 must-have! Special Edition Alan Turing Monopoly raising funds for Bletchley Park.  But if Turing was such a genius, how come he lost Monopoly to a schoolboy? Well, as the saying goes: &apos;Nothing in life is certain&apos;. Nearly 80 years ago, that was something Alan Turing proved to be true - he predicted unpredictability in his famous 1936 paper, written when he was just 23. Even before computers - real life Turing machines - were built, Turing had predicted that your computer would let you down, and you could not be sure exactly when it would happen. Today, computer scientists trace such uncertainty back to the &apos;unsolvability of the Halting Problem for the Universal Turing Machine&apos;. Turing showed that computers, though very useful, are not that clever. And that most complex problems are actually &apos;incomputable&apos;. We can&apos;t even predict the weather reliably more than 10 days ahead.     Opportunities, hazards - and random falls of the dice. The Turing board.    According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first recorded use of the word &apos;incomputable&apos; goes back to 1606. Uncertainty is familiar to us from earliest times, but the word &apos;computable&quot; appeared relatively late Besides discovering the very real nature of incomputability, Turing spent much of his life struggling with the dangerous beast.  Sadly, it killed him in the end (with some help from the British authorities), despite all the brilliant work he put in at Bletchley Park and Manchester on decoding hidden information in the world. I once stayed with Turing&apos;s only PhD student, Robin Gandy, after he had given up his Chair at Manchester University and moved to Oxford. (I first knew Robin in 1968 Manchester, shortly after he had been lost his licence for driving his car into the front of a fish and chip shop; he also rode a motor bike, and had a little of the &apos;Toad of Toad Hall&apos; about him). Gandy had been talking to Alan Turing just days before he died in his Wilmslow house of cyanide poisoning. I asked him why his friend and teacher had taken his own life. Robin looked into the distance , and said &quot;some things happen for no reason&quot;. Robin himself died in 1995.     Robin Gandy    There are many areas of life where unpredictability appears to verge on very real incomputability. It&apos;s a controversial topic amongst scientists. People are a huge test for the computer. Turing famously set in motion modern Artificial Intelligence (or &apos;Mechanical Intelligence&apos; as he called it), giving us the &apos;Turing Test&apos; for intelligence in machines - notice that he asks humans, not machines, to act as judges of intelligence. Andrew Hodges calls his book on Turing The Enigma, referring to how little we can &apos;compute&apos; of the real inner Alan Turing. My talk at the 2004 meeting in Manchester to mark the 50th anniversary of Turing&apos;s death was called &apos;The Incomputable Alan Turing&apos;. A nice piece of incomputability at that event was the fire alarm going off in the final talk, which was about Turing&apos;s work on emergence of patterns in nature: the speaker Jonathan Swinton bravely completed his talk on the concrete steps outside, the surrounding audience in a big huddle, craning necks to see pictures of sunflowers and zebra stripes on the hand-held laptop. In physics we now know a lot about quantum mechanics, relativity, and the origins of the universe. But we still do not know how the universe &apos;computes&apos; the laws of nature or the exact values of physical constants needed to make physical theory work. Albert Einstein deplored this, and also disliked the randomness quantum mechanics contains. &quot;God does not play dice&quot; he famously proclaimed.     Turing money for the game. Maybe he'll be on a real banknote soon.    Turing was fascinated by quantum unpredictability throughout his life, and sat in on lectures by the discoverer of anti-matter and Nobel Prize winner Paul Dirac in Cambridge. Of course, there is no such thing as complete randomness. But incomputability can look random. When Alan played William Newman at Monopoly, the dice throws would have given the outcome of the game that added bit of incomputability. Adapting Einstein, we might ask &quot;Did Turing play dice?&quot; getting the answer:   Yes! and we will too this Christmas, on our new Turing Centenary Monopoly Boards.  And for those of us know about Turing&apos;s unsolvable Halting Problem - @AlanTuringYear tweeted on Twitter:  Brilliant! Where&apos;s the Halting Problem in the new Turing Monopoly? It&apos;s coded into game itself.   An in-joke, for all of us who know about the incomputability of life and have memories of interminable Monopoly games! Closest to home, it&apos;s economics that makes incomputability scariest. I have just returned from giving a talk on Turing and incomputability at a world congress of economists in Taiwan. It is amazing how closely Turing&apos;s work on the emergence of patterns in nature is related to the way economists try to model the complexity of the world of economics.  And they do acknowledge their debt, talking about &apos;Turing&apos;s economics&apos;. Just like Turing, they use models, Bayesian statistics, simulations, etc, to extract the information hidden in the real world. Sometimes they succeed. But all too often the beast of incomputability rears its head, and like Turing, all we have is our courage and human intelligence to get us through. We are told economic stability is here for good. And then reality is quite different.     Nassim Taleb    How about these last words from Nassim Taleb, who famously predicted the 2008 crash, quoted from his best-selling book The Black Swan on unpredictability in economics (it seems leading politicians take notice of Taleb):  I have spent my entire life studying randomness, practicing randomness, hating randomness. ... Every morning the world appears to me more random than it did the day before, and humans seem to be even more fooled by it than they were the previous day. It is becoming unbearable.

A police statement reported by the official Xinhua news agency said 5,000 officers were dispatched to the scene. The violence was brought under control after about four hours and 40 people were taken to hospitals for treatment, the Taiwanese-owned company said. It said several people were detained by police. The violence did not appear to be work-related, the company and police said. Comments posted on Chinese internet bulletin boards said it might have erupted after a security guard hit an employee. The Taiyuan plant, which employs about 79,000 workers, makes parts for automotive electronics and assembles various electronic devices, according to Woo. Other staff sources said it makes parts for and assembles Apple&apos;s new iPhone 5, released last week. It was not clear how long the shutdown would last at the plant. Woo said the fight happened in the workers&apos; dormitory facilities. Photographs of the incident that were posted to social networks but later deleted showed smashed windows and riot police, and crowds of workers. Later pictures from just outside the plant showed workers clearing shards of glass from broken windows at a building by an entrance gate and a line of olive-coloured paramilitary police trucks parked inside the factory grounds. Geoffrey Crothall, spokesman for the pressure group China Labor Bulletin, told the New York Times workers at the plants had become increasingly emboldened. &quot;They&apos;re more willing to stand up for their rights, to stand up to injustice,&quot; he said. The same plant was the subject of a brief strike over pay in March. Foxconn, the trading name of Taiwan&apos;s Hon Hai Precision Industry Company, is the world&apos;s largest contract maker of electronic goods.

In June, about 100 workers went on a rampage at a Chengdu plant in south-west China.

The long-running territorial dispute has escalated dramatically in recent weeks, with violent anti-Japanese protests in China over the uninhabited islets, known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. Koichiro Gemba urged Beijing to exercise restraint when he met his counterpart, Yang Jieshi, on the sidelines of the UN general assembly on Tuesday, according to Japan&apos;s Kyodo news agency. Xinhua, China&apos;s state news agency, said Yang reiterated that the East China Sea islands had been the country&apos;s &quot;sacred territory since ancient times&quot;. The Japanese chief cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, told a news conference in Tokyo that talks were needed through various channels, adding: &quot;There is no magic bullet in foreign diplomacy.&quot; The countries&apos; deputy foreign ministers had also held talks in Beijing on Monday. China&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman said they discussed issues &quot;frankly and deeply&quot;. Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, north Asia director for the International Crisis Group, welcomed the discussions as a positive step. &quot;It&apos;s a good sign that they&apos;re talking, but it&apos;s difficult to see how either one is going to be able to substantially walk back their positions,&quot; she said. &quot;One hopes they will be able to exercise the leadership and vision necessary, but there are domestic challenges in both countries which make it very difficult for the leaderships to be seen as weak on this issue. The status quo was broken by Japan&apos;s purchase of the islands and China&apos;s announcement of the baseline.&quot; China is preparing for the handover of power to a new generation of leaders, while in Japan the unpopular ruling party will soon face an election. Japan&apos;s purchase of the islands came after the nationalist governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, said the city would buy them. The central government feared that would spark greater conflict. The islands are surrounded by fisheries and potentially valuable energy resources, but the dispute is also fuelled by long-running historical tensions over Japan&apos;s brutal occupation of China in the 1930s and 1940s, as well as Japanese anxieties over China&apos;s growing might. Analysts say neither side wants the matter to escalate \u2013 particularly given the risk of further damage to crucial economic ties. But there are concerns that an unintended collision or a misjudgment in a standoff between vessels from the two countries in the waters around the islands might spark a more serious clash. Reuters reported that Japanese carmakers Toyota, Nissan and Suzuki are already cutting back on production in China after the mass protests closed dealerships and dimmed sales prospects. Xinhua said over 52,000 seat reservations have been cancelled on flights between the two countries between September and November, citing All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. On Monday, the Japanese coastguard used water cannon to disperse dozens of fishing boats from Taiwan \u2013 which also claims the islands \u2013 from disputed waters. A spokesman for Beijing&apos;s state council Taiwan affairs office said that Chinese vessels would be ready to offer help to both Taiwanese and mainland vessels fishing around the islands, Xinhua reported on Wednesday. China is involved in several territorial disputes. Xinhua announced that officials plan a 10-fold increase in the maximum punishment for failures to map it in full. Current regulations stipulate a fine of up to 10,000 yuan for those who fail to include the country&apos;s entire territory, but the new law would increase the maximum penalty to 100,000 yuan."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/01/china-elderly-population-pensions-rethink", "publicationDate": "2012-10-01T11:44:00Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Social protection", "Population", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["Neighbouring countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, face similar problems."], "title": "China's rocketing elderly population prompts a rethink on pensions | Darren Wee", "article": "Early in the morning, an army of older workers descend onto Beijing&apos;s streets, rummaging through bins for recyclable materials. Plastic bottles can be sold for 1 mao (less than $0.02). For many older Chinese people, this is their retirement plan. The basic pension is just 55 yuan ($8.75) a month, forcing thousands to collect rubbish to make ends meet. Filial piety is the first of the five Confucian bonds that have traditionally tied Chinese society together; caring for one&apos;s parents in later life is a child&apos;s duty. But these bonds are being broken by China&apos;s rapid development. Life expectancy in the country has soared and the fertility rate has plummeted, putting a heavy financial burden on the next generation. China&apos;s fertility rate stands at 1.6, far below the 2.1 needed to sustain a growing population. In 2007, there were 167 million people over the age of 60, a number expected to grow to 480 million by 2050. The ratio of working-age adults to pensioners is 3:5, but thfigure is expected to fall to 2:1 by 2035. The one-child policy puts pressure on the second and third generations of only children. A couple who are both only children will have four parents to care for between them, and their children could potentially have four parents and eight grandparents to look after. Neighbouring countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, face similar problems. But these countries are already developed; China is unique in that it is getting old before getting rich. To tackle this problem, the Chinese government introduced a rural pension plan in 2009 and a new urban pension plan in 2011. Before 2009, only 30% of the population had a pension; now, 55% are covered (664 million people). Looking at the numbers, the pension plan appears to be a success \u2013 240 million people have signed up for the rural pension since it was introduced. But pensions vary from city to city, from urban to rural areas, and from public to private sectors. Last week, China announced plans to reform its pension system after a report published by the Bank of China and Deutsche Bank showed an 18.3tn yuan ($2.9tn) deficit in its social security fund in 2013. If nothing is done, this gap will widen to 68.2tn yuan ($10.9tn) by 2033. Part of the government&apos;s plan is to raise the retirement age, which at the moment is 60 for men, 55 for women working in white-collar industries, and 50 for blue-collar female workers. But 93.3% of the 450,000 respondents to a poll on the People&apos;s Daily website were against the idea, while only 2.4% were in favour. This puts the Chinese Communist party in an awkward position, not least because some of the most high-profile corruption scandals in China involved social security funds. In 2006, five Shanghai officials were sacked for misappropriating a third of the city&apos;s 10bn yuan social security fund. China also operates a dual-track system. Private sector workers pay 8% of their salary into the pension pot and their employers contribute another 3%. The government covers all public sector pensions, which are linked to government salaries rather than inflation, as government salaries rise faster than inflation. Netizens have not failed to notice these inequalities."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/02/jeremy-lin-linsanity-houston-rockets-new-york-knicks", "publicationDate": "2012-10-02T15:55:00Z", "tags": ["Jeremy Lin", "NBA", "Houston Rockets", "US sports", "Sport", "New York Knicks"], "sentences": ["Born in Los Angeles to Taiwanese parents, Lin&apos;s arrival will reinforce the popularity of the Rockets in Asia after the 2011 retirement of their Chinese eight-time All-Star, Yao Ming."], "title": "Jeremy Lin brings Linsanity to Houston | Tom Dart", "article": "Jeremy Lin&apos;s stardom may have peaked now that he has left New York for Texas, but the 24-year-old believes that he will get &quot;a lot&quot; better as a player. That would be extraordinary for a man who last season made one of the biggest instant impacts in American sports history, but also necessary if the Rockets are to have any prospect of reaching the playoffs. &quot;I&apos;ve played 50 career games probably, something like that,&quot; Lin said on Monday. &quot;For me it is just the beginning. I&apos;m very young in terms of learning. Every day I make a lot of mistakes in practice. As I cut down on those and hopefully grow my game I&apos;ll be able to evolve.&quot; As Houston Rockets players and staff lauded Lin, the New York Knicks held their own media day and did their best to say as little as possible about him. &quot;Basically, it comes down to the fact that Houston made a commitment to him that we weren&apos;t prepared to make,&quot; Knicks general manager Glen Grunwald said in the team&apos;s first public comments about Lin&apos;s departure. In mid-July the Knicks passed on the option to match Houston&apos;s boggling free-agent offer: $25.1 million in wages over three years for a player with 64 career NBA appearances, only 25 of them starts. A player Houston themselves had signed then cut just seven months earlier because they decided he would not get playing time and wanted to free space on the payroll. The Knicks decided the sums did not add up. The equation was something like this: cost plus celebrity, divided by talent. Their rejection was logical but unconventional: shouldn&apos;t a starlet graduate from Houston to Manhattan, not vice versa? From a smaller franchise to a bigger one? Kings of New York are not meant to abdicate and move to Texas. After the purple patch, the gray areas. Lin is a marquee player who is both established and an unknown quantity, because part of his fame springs from his inexperience: a story fit for the Twitter era of sudden trends about how someone so obscure could become so good, so quickly. He was a phenomenon within a week of his first NBA start. Impossible yet to discount the possibility that a fall will be as swift as the rise, that the substance will not keep pace with the celebrity. Being average would be a disappointment.     Linsanity. Photograph: Mike Cassese/Reuters    Fuelled by points and puns, the &quot;Linsanity&quot; era began on February 4 when he accrued 25 points and seven assists for the Knicks against the New Jersey Nets. His first career start came two days later: 28 points, 8 assists. On February 10, Lin scored 38 points against the Los Angeles Lakers, outduelling Kobe Bryant. A knee injury ended his season in March, shortly before Time Magazine named him as one of the hundred most influential people in the world. Lin averaged 14.6 points and 6.1 assists over 35 appearances. But his performances declined badly in his last few games and his rate of 3.6 turnovers per contest is a worry. The $25m outlay has brought buzz to an overlooked, unglamorous and lately unsuccessful club. Houston last made the playoffs in 2009. Born in Los Angeles to Taiwanese parents, Lin&apos;s arrival will reinforce the popularity of the Rockets in Asia after the 2011 retirement of their Chinese eight-time All-Star, Yao Ming. As if symbolically, a restaurant in downtown named after Yao closed its doors last week. There is local sponsorship potential since Houston itself is far more diverse than its cowboys and oilfields image implies: nearly eight per cent of the four million people who live in the Houston region are Asian. And there are lots of empty seats to fill in Toyota Center: last season the Rockets ranked 22nd out of 30 NBA teams in average attendance. About 40 journalists, a quarter of them Asian, quizzed Harvard-graduate Lin on Monday in a television studio at the headquarters of Comcast SportsNet Houston, a regional network that launched the same night. It will broadcast Rockets games and the club has a near-31 per cent stake in the venture: a good moment to sign one of the world&apos;s most famous sportsmen, then. After their media duties, the Rockets flew to a training camp in the relative obscurity of McAllen, a border town in the Rio Grande Valley. Their first regular-season game of 2012-13 is away to the Detroit Pistons on October 31. Lin is reluctant to describe himself as the face of the franchise, though whoever produces the Rockets&apos; marketing material naturally thinks otherwise. &quot;Some of the guys, more experienced, older guys, I&apos;m going to look up to them,&quot; Lin said. &quot;I had a lot of fun last year and I&apos;m having a lot of fun right now. It&apos;s definitely a different feel. We&apos;re all new to this thing and we&apos;re all in it together. It&apos;s a new challenge.&quot; The irony of &quot;Linsanity&quot; is Lin&apos;s sanity: that the guy in the middle of the madness remains utterly, defiantly, improbably rational. When he moved back to Houston he slept on the couch of a new team-mate, Chandler Parsons, for a couple of nights. &quot;He&apos;s just an unbelievable person. Everything he got last year, he never asked for. He&apos;s so humble,&quot; Parsons said. &quot;I&apos;m a pretty lighthearted person,&quot; Lin said. &quot;I don&apos;t really read or look at too much stuff that&apos;s written about me. If I read too much good stuff it might take away my edge. I might get a little complacent.&quot; As for how fellow players might view him: &quot;I&apos;m going to play this game whether there&apos;s a target on my back or not. I don&apos;t feel [any] resentment, it doesn&apos;t change my approach.&quot; Longer gaps between games compared with last year&apos;s condensed campaign should slow any bandwagons. And Texas might be the antidote to Lin fever. He said he wants to play &quot;blue-collar&quot; basketball: tough and hard-working. The ethos should fit well in Houston, a practical place which will care more about how good he is at sinking three-pointers than whether he is a media construct acting as a touchstone for analysis of Asian-American race relations and the nature of modern celebrity. Houston does not do frenzies, or circuses. The weather&apos;s too darn hot to get worked up about &apos;most anything. Basketball is at best the fourth-favorite sport, after NFL football, college football and high school football. Lin could score 40 points in a game this season and a Houston Texans player breaking a fingernail would still command more attention. This city wants winners, and the Texans have started the season 4-0. The most likely time for undivided focus on the Rockets is the spring, when football is over, the NBA is climaxing and the locals will want something to avert their gaze from the abysmal Houston Astros baseball team. But it would be bold to predict that such a young and mediocre-looking side as the Rockets will still be in post-season contention, no matter how great Lin&apos;s contribution. All in all, Houston might be an ideal environment for Lin: as near to normal as he could hope to find. Of course, Lin proving to be normal is exactly what the Rockets are afraid of.

I would preferably like one that is: lightweight and so easy to carry, durable, and fashionable, with the latest technology and specification to handle multimedia, graphics, Adobe software etc. Money is not a concern. What are your opinions on the Sony S and E series (i5), and could you recommend one for me please?Esther By far the largest proportion of the Windows laptop market is for economy-priced machines, which usually cost less than \u00a3500. However, most of the larger suppliers have at least one well constructed high-end design, and in private, may even refer to it as a &quot;hero product&quot;. Today, this should have a third generation Intel Core iX chip, code-named Ivy Bridge, and it may well have a dedicated graphics chip, to supplement the Intel HD 4000 graphics probably built into the processor. Several of these systems also include built in 3G connections as well as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The &quot;hero product&quot; will often have a 1600 x 900 screen display instead of the usual 1366 x 768 pixels. Opting for this on anything smaller than a 17in screen will eliminate the vast majority of Windows laptops and almost guarantees a better quality machine. It also means that text looks smaller. Look at this resolution in a shop: it is not to everyone&apos;s taste. At the moment, the Sony S Series 13P probably fills the hero niche (the P stands for Premium) previously occupied by the &quot;ultimate&quot; Vaio Z. By comparison, the E Series uses plastic construction and competes in the economy market (&quot;Stand-out style and everyday essentials for work and play,&quot; says Sony) at \u00a3400 to \u00a3500. The major difference between the Sony S Series 13 and the 13P is that the S has the base-level 13.3in widescreen with a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. The 13P has a Premium Display with a resolution of 1600 x 900 pixels.  The Sony S Series 13 is the one you are most likely to see in a shop. It is usually white, but is also available in black and silver versions for an extra \u00a320. The S Series 13P model comes in either carbon black or a gun-metal finish. Sony also sells a silver S Series 15 with a 15.5in Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixel) screen. All three are available from the Sony UK website. The main advantage of buying direct is that you can configure your own laptop, with a choice of processor, memory, hard drive, optical drive, operating system and additional software. Also, you know you will get the latest version. Sony has been making S Series laptops for a few years and doesn&apos;t change the name when it updates the specification. The standard black S Series 13P (code SVS13A1C5E in the UK; SVS13A190X in the USA) starts at \u00a31,020. However, you can upgrade from a 2.5GHz Intel Core i5-3210M to a 2.9GHz Core i7-3520M for an extra \u00a350, and upgrade the slot-loading DVD player to Blu-ray for an extra \u00a340. These are bargain prices. Upgrading from 4GB of memory to 8GB costs \u00a3100, which isn&apos;t, but you could increase it to 6GB for \u00a350 or fit your own extra RAM. The 13P&apos;s Nvidia GeForce GT 640M LE graphics comes with 1GB of memory as standard, and upgrading to 2GB costs an extra \u00a330. This would be useful for handling graphics, including your Adobe software and any high-end games. But for most computing purposes, such as word processing and web browsing, the dedicated graphics will usually be turned off to save battery power. An upgraded 13P with a backlit keyboard, Core i7 processor, 6GB of main memory, 2GB of video memory, 500GB hard drive, Blu-ray, three USB ports and two-year warranty comes out at \u00a31,241.While this is expensive for a Windows laptop, it&apos;s the same as a 13.3in MacBook Pro with a similar spec (\u00a31,249). The MacBook Pro has a bigger hard drive (750GB), but the Sony 13P has dedicated graphics, and Apple doesn&apos;t offer you Blu-ray or 3G. Whether you need these is another matter. The Sony S Series 13P is a high-end ultraportable, and would typically compete with other ultraportable business laptops such as the Lenovo ThinkPad X range and Toshiba&apos;s Port\u00e9g\u00e9 machines. However, the market has shifted over the past couple of years, following the success of Apple&apos;s MacBook Air. Most PC companies now offer similar Windows laptops following Intel&apos;s Ultrabook specification. This requires, among other things, a thin body and fast start-up and resume times. The MacBook Air and Ultrabooks are today&apos;s fashion, but manufacturers make some sacrifices to create thinner laptops. These include dropping the optical drive (which ultraportable ThinkPads did last century), restricting the number of ports, sealing in the battery, and replacing the hard drive with Flash memory chips. These SSDs (solid state drives) provide much snappier performance, especially since you never have to wait for hard drive platters to spin up to speed. The disadvantages are that SSDs are expensive and tend to be rather small, eg 128GB or 256GB. Sony&apos;s Ultrabook is the Vaio T Series, which is similar to the S Series but better value. Prices start at \u00a3649 for the model with an 11.6in screen and \u00a3679 for the 13.3in version. Upgrading a T13 to a 1.7GHz Core i5-3317U processor, 8GB of memory and 128GB SSD will set you back \u00a3819. Compared with the 13P, you lose processor speed, the dedicated Nvidia graphics, keyboard backlighting and the DVD or Blu-ray drive, but gain in SSD speed and battery life. Weight is about the same. Several other Ultrabooks are also worth considering. The leading examples are the new Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, Toshiba Port\u00e9g\u00e9 Z903, Samsung Series 9 and Asus Zenbook UX32A. All of these have the latest Intel Core i5-3317U (Ivy Bridge) processor or better. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon and Samsung Series 9 have the edge in showing 1600 x 900 pixels, whereas the Asus and Toshiba models only do the usual 1366 x 768. However, the X1 Carbon comes at a price, with the cheapest version costing \u00a31,039.99 if bought direct. The Toshiba Port\u00e9g\u00e9 Z930-11G costs even more. By contrast, you could get a shiny Asus UX32A for \u00a3695.92 at Amazon.co.uk, reduced from \u00a3849.99, or a chic Samsung Series 9 (NP900X3C-A02UK) for \u00a3922.09, reduced from \u00a31,199.  Asus also has a high-end Zenbook, the UX32VD, with a Full HD (1920 x 1080) screen, Nvidia GeForce GT 620M dedicated graphics and a somewhat better keyboard. This has not (as far as I know) been announced in the UK, so any you see will be imported. Either way, text will be rather small with so many pixels on screen, even with Windows 7&apos;s magnification set to 125%. After that, it&apos;s down to whether you like the screen and keyboard, what your main uses will be, and personal choice. If you will be carrying the machine around and stopping and starting it regularly, you would benefit from the longer battery life and fast resume times of an Ultrabook. If you will be using it more at home, or with heavyweight software, then you will benefit from the extra power and graphics of an ultraportable such as the Sony Series S 13P or Vaio Z.  You might even want to step up from a 13.3in or 14in (X1 Carbon) screen to a 15.6in laptop, though this would mean carrying a bigger and heavier machine. If so, judging by reviews, a Samsung such as the Series 9 (900X4C) could be a better buy than the Sony S Series 15.  In general, I like the Sony hardware, but the company has a reputation for loading its laptops with unwanted software. It&apos;s not always easy to remove programs you don&apos;t want, and it comes back if you need to re-set the laptop to factory condition using the recovery partition on the hard drive.  Of course, Sony is not the only Windows supplier to do this to its consumer laptops. Business machines such as Lenovo ThinkPads, Toshiba Port\u00e9g\u00e9s and Dell Vostros usually ship with much less bloatware. They also tend to be designed for greater durability rather than the lowest price. When it comes to fashionability, the Sony and ThinkPad brands stand out from the general morass of Windows laptops, with the ThinkPad being the leading business brand over the past 20 years. But neither of these is quite at the pinnacles of yesteryear, following Sony&apos;s long-term financial problems and the sale of IBM&apos;s PC division (which developed the ThinkPad) to China&apos;s Lenovo in 2005. The companies that are increasing their brand value are South Korea&apos;s Samsung and Taiwan&apos;s Asus. These are becoming prestige brands in parts of Asia, though perhaps not yet in the west. The Sony S Series 13P and ThinkPad X1 Carbon have the most cachet, but the Samsung Series 9 and Asus Zenbook may be better value for money at discounted prices."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/05/samsung-operating-profit-4-5-billion", "publicationDate": "2012-10-05T07:17:54Z", "tags": ["Samsung", "Technology", "Apple", "South Korea", "World news", "Smartphones", "US news", "Tablet computers"], "sentences": ["So far though, there is no sign of that happening, with its former key rivals \u2013 Finland&apos;s Nokia, Taiwan&apos;s HTC and Motorola in the US \u2013 falling behind in both profits and shipments."], "title": "Samsung to report profits of \u00a34.5bn", "article": "Samsung Electronics says it will report a record quarterly operating profit of 8.1tn Korean won (\u00a34.5bn), nearly double last year&apos;s and up 25% sequentially, as strong sales of high-end TVs and Galaxy smartphones more than offset reduced orders for chips and screens from Apple, its main rival and leading customer. The figure covers the three months to the end of September. Most analysts, however, expect its run of four straight record quarters to end in December as the South Korean group, the world&apos;s leading maker of smartphones, TVs and memory chips, ramps up its marketing to counter Apple&apos;s new iPhone and other products in the increasingly crowded and competitive $200bn (\u00a3123.5bn) global smartphone market. The operating profit figure is an estimate provided by Samsung itself in an earnings preview. That beat the consensus from a poll of 26 analysts, who pegged it at 7.6tn won, up from 4.25tn a year ago. Samsung may have spent around $2.7bn on marketing in July-September alone around the London Olympic Games, for which it was a major sponsor, and new Galaxy promotions, Credit Suisse has estimated. This year&apos;s expected record profit of 28tn won will also trigger higher performance-related payouts to many of Samsung&apos;s 206,000 staff early next year. The business may have to set money aside in the current quarter if it fails in an appeal to overturn a US court verdict from August which awarded more than $1bn in damages to Apple for patent infringements on phones and tablets. &quot;Fourth-quarter profit will be pressured by one-off expenses: performance payouts and some $1bn in legal provisioning relating to the Apple litigation. Excluding those, core earnings will remain solid and a swing factor is how much Samsung spends on marketing,&quot; said Lee Sun-tae, analyst at NH Investment &amp; Securities. Analysts expect earnings to decline until the second quarter of next year as a slump in computer sales and a weak global economy sap demand for chips and electronics products. Smartphone tightrope &quot;The biggest risk for Samsung is competitive product line-ups from its rivals such as the iPhone 5. Because handsets drive most of its profits, one misstep in handsets could result in losses for the whole Samsung group,&quot; said Byun Han-joon, an analyst at KB Investment &amp; Securities. So far though, there is no sign of that happening, with its former key rivals \u2013 Finland&apos;s Nokia, Taiwan&apos;s HTC and Motorola in the US \u2013 falling behind in both profits and shipments. Profit at Samsung&apos;s mobile division is likely to have more than doubled in July-September to around 5tn won \u2013 around two thirds of total group profit \u2013 as smartphone shipments are estimated to have topped 58m, including up to 20m Galaxy S IIIs. Samsung does not give figures for its shipments of smartphones, mobile phones or tablets, which are instead estimated by analysts. The company, valued at around $197bn, estimated its third-quarter revenue at 52tn won, in line with forecasts. Chips, cheaply?  Strong handset sales compensated for reduced profits from its chip business, as prices of its mainstay dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, used in computers and mobiles, dropped 14% in the September quarter. DRAM chips now trade below what it costs most contract manufacturers to make them, and will squeeze near-term earnings, analysts say. Tablets and smartphones, the real growth areas, use far less storage. Samsung is expected to invest less in chips next year due to the drop in demand, which could be bad news for semiconductor equipment manufacturers such as ASML. Kwon Oh-hyun, promoted to Samsung CEO in June, said late last month that the group has yet to finalise its 2013 investment plans. Samsung is beefing up its product line-up, with the latest phone-cum-tablet Galaxy Note expected to go on sale in the US this month, and its ATIV smartphones that run on Microsoft&apos;s new Windows system to compete with Nokia&apos;s Lumia series. Note-taking Samsung&apos;s mobile division chief, JK Shin last, week predicted that sales of its large-screen Galaxy Note II could be three times higher than those of its predecessor model in the three months after launch. That would suggest sales of around 10m devices by the end of this year. Some analysts see the Note II, along with a stripped-down, cheaper version of the flagship Galaxy S III smartphone and rising NAND flash memory chip prices helping Samsung deliver higher fourth-quarter profit. Nomura on Friday predicted October-December profit could be up to 10% more than the 8.1tn won in July-September. In a note on Friday, Citi analyst Henry Kim predicted strong October-December profits, driven by a recovery in semiconductors, though telecoms operating margins could decline by 5 percentage points to 15% as it spends more on marketing. &quot;The semiconductor division will show the strongest momentum,&quot; he said. Despite a bruising series of patent disputes and the reputational risk of the US court defeat in August, Samsung&apos;s brand value has surged this year as it shipped more handsets and smartphones than any of its rivals. The value of the Samsung brand has jumped to 9th in the world \u2013 up from 17th last year \u2013 at $32.9bn, according to brand consultancy Interbrand. That&apos;s more than Toyota Motor, but less than half of second-ranked Apple&apos;s $76.6bn."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/07/british-innovation-not-dead-public-investment", "publicationDate": "2012-10-07T10:30:01Z", "tags": ["Technology startups", "Technology", "Internet", "Science", "Business", "UK news", "US news"], "sentences": ["Countries like Finland, South Korea, Israel and Taiwan have made innovation a priority \u2013 making it easier for new businesses to start up, investing in education and research, and helping bridge the &quot;valley of death&quot; between invention and commercialisation."], "title": "British innovation is not dead. But it needs public investment to flourish | Stian Westlake", "article": "Some of Britain&apos;s sharpest journalists seem to be getting fed up with innovation. This week, Martin Wolf, the godfather of British economic journalists, claimed that the economy is stagnating because modern innovations don&apos;t measure up to the breakthroughs of the 20th century. Cars and flushing toilets, he says, are a bigger deal than Facebook and Twitter. The Guardian&apos;s Aditya Chakrabortty went a step further, arguing that today&apos;s innovations are unusually shallow and silly (do we need bigger plasma TVs when Africans are dying of malaria?) and that the spectacle of politicians traipsing round Shoreditch startups and talking about innovation is embarrassing. As someone who traipses around startups from time to time and who researches innovation the rest of the time, I&apos;m not convinced. The potential of innovation to transform our lives is as great as it has ever been, and government has an important role to play in creating the conditions for it. Let&apos;s look first of all at the question of whether innovation can still deliver the goods. This matters a lot for the economy, since in rich countries most growth is the result of innovation (our Innovation Index showed it was responsible for two-thirds of the UK&apos;s growth since 1990). Wolf and Chakrabortty both reference an influential new paper by economist Robert Gordon, who suggests that the past 40 years of new technologies aren&apos;t a patch on the great innovations of the past. But all this assumes that the IT revolution we&apos;ve seen over the last 30 years is fully played out. This would come as a surprise to pioneers of personal manufacturing or self-driving cars, or to patients using technology to revolutionise healthcare. Perhaps the lesson is that if you want to know about the future benefits of technology, ask an engineer, not an economist. It&apos;s no surprise that Brian Arthur, for 30 years one of the world&apos;s most thoughtful commentators on technology and economics, is an engineer \u2013 and for what it&apos;s worth, he thinks we&apos;re only halfway through the IT revolution. But does all this innovation really improve our lives? Isn&apos;t modern innovation about creating useless trash and trinkets, like the self-sorting socks and giant televisions that Chakrabortty describes? Yes and no. Like making sausages, innovation is not always an edifying thing to watch. It&apos;s inherently uncertain, and that means that most innovations will be useless, or tawdry, or even downright harmful. But it was ever thus. The golden age of Thomas Edison and Henry Bessemer also gave rise to wonders like the Revigator, which would enrich drinking water with radioactive radon gas, or the hosts of quack remedies that filled the pages of Victorian newspapers. Looking at the worst innovations of a given age tells us little about whether innovation is in a healthy state. So we shouldn&apos;t be pessimistic about innovation. But neither can we take it for granted. Governments can make it easier or harder for innovation to flourish. Countries like Finland, South Korea, Israel and Taiwan have made innovation a priority \u2013 making it easier for new businesses to start up, investing in education and research, and helping bridge the &quot;valley of death&quot; between invention and commercialisation. The United States, which we like to think of as a bastion of market liberalism, invests tens of billions of taxpayer dollars each year in technologies through institutions ranging from the vast National Institutes of Health to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which gave rise to the internet, the graphical user interface, the global positioning system and the self-driving car. Innovation doesn&apos;t come from the government. But without good public policy, it won&apos;t thrive. So politicians should talk more about innovation, not less. Politicians from Finland or Korea would find it astounding that a senior politician could propose taking the proceeds of the 4G spectrum auction, the fruits of decades of technological innovation, and investing it not in the next generation of technology but into stamp duty tax breaks. Investment in innovation has fallen by \u00a324bn since 2008. If we want economic recovery, our leaders should be spending less time debating Plan A and Plan B, and more on innovation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/oct/08/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2012-10-08T05:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Apple", "Google", "Microsoft"], "sentences": ["MacBook Air to occupy 39% of global slim notebook market in 2012, 28% in 2013, say Taiwan makers &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Apple&apos;s MacBook Air is expected to have a global market share of 39% for slim notebooks in 2012 and the market share will slip to 28% in 2013 due to increasing sales of ultrabooks, according to Taiwan-based notebook supply chain makers."], "title": "Boot up: Raspberry Pi password caution, new Nexus details?, mistakes Jobs made and more", "article": "A quick burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Context is the new battleground between Android and iOS &gt;&gt; Scobleizer &quot;Apps that understand context&quot; is Robert Scoble&apos;s new riff, and he seems to be onto something.

These distribution dynamics leave almost no room for HTC to remain visible in the market.&quot; HTC&apos;s share of the global smartphone market by shipments fell to 5.8% in the second quarter from 10.7% a year earlier, according to Bloomberg. The company released its first Windows Phone 8 models in September, its most high-profile pre-Christmas launch, but Microsoft&apos;s operating system has yet to establish itself as a serious third player after Google&apos;s Android and Apple&apos;s iOS. HTC&apos;s revenues, profits and handset shipments peaked in the third quarter of 2011 and began falling in the fourth quarter of 2011, when Apple and Samsung increased their efforts to control the US market. &quot;Samsung is the reason HTC is struggling,&quot; said Francisco Jeronimo at the research firm IDC. &quot;HTC devices are good, the brand is strong and they keep on innovating, but Samsung invests significantly more at the point of sale compared with HTC.&quot; HTC has seen falling average selling prices for its phones as it has tried to break into the fast-growing Chinese market. Approximately 30% of shipments go to China but price pressures mean they account for only 20% of revenues. Carolina Milanesi, a smartphones analyst at Gartner, another research company, said HTC needed to concentrate on sales to big &quot;enterprise&quot; businesses where &quot;bring your own device&quot; (BYOD) policies were in place: &quot;It seems to me that on the Android side, they tried to go for the low end to get [market] share, but that did not work much, and now they want to go back to their core. In Android I think they should become an enabler of BYOD \u2013 so focus on making Android a better platform to bring into the enterprise.&quot; Samsung has tried to do that but so far &quot;not made much inroad&quot;, she suggested. &quot;I believe that HTC would have a better chance at that, as this is where they started,&quot; Milanesi said. &quot;They knew how to do it.&quot; HTC started out as a contract manufacturer making white-label smartphones running Microsoft&apos;s Windows Mobile software, and then created its own brand. Milanesi suggested that now its Windows Phone models would not be its salvation: &quot;The Microsoft [Windows Phone] phones are good, but they risk being swallowed in the Microsoft PR machine. HTC needs to push the envelope on innovation. It seems to me that on that side they have not had an industry first for a while. They used to lead with connectivity and integration, but have not done so in a while. They need to be more vocal about their brand, and consistent in their message \u2013 so they talk more about the company and the differentiation on their devices, building a story on who they are as a company.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/09/ipad-mini-wifi-uk-4g", "publicationDate": "2012-10-09T17:50:42Z", "tags": ["iPad", "iPhone", "iPhone 5", "Apple", "4G", "Technology", "UK news", "US news", "iPad mini"], "sentences": ["That would compete directly with Google&apos;s Nexus 7 tablet, made by Taiwan&apos;s Asus, and Amazon&apos;s Kindle Fire tablets, both of which measure 7in diagonally."], "title": "'iPad mini' likely to be Wi-Fi-only \u2013 but revised 9.7in model will offer UK 4G", "article": "Apple&apos;s expected &quot;iPad mini&quot; will only come in a Wi-Fi version \u2013 but there will also be a revised version of the iPad with 4G connectivity compatible with the UK&apos;s Everything Everywhere network, and sporting the new &quot;Lightning&quot; connector, industry sources have told the Guardian. Rumours have been building for months that Apple would move into the lower-priced end of the tablet market by offering a smaller version of its 9.7in iPad, dubbed the &quot;iPad mini&quot; and with a 7.8in screen. That would compete directly with Google&apos;s Nexus 7 tablet, made by Taiwan&apos;s Asus, and Amazon&apos;s Kindle Fire tablets, both of which measure 7in diagonally.  Multiple sources contacted by the Guardian have indicated that they think the announcement of the &quot;iPad mini&quot; is imminent, with retail sources saying that they anticipate new products in November.  One company, Knomo, which designs cases for Apple products, said on Tuesday that it would have an iPad mini case available within days \u2013 even though no invitations have yet been sent out for any launch. Earlier on Tuesday Sonny Dickson, an Australian writer, tweeted pictures of what he said was the &quot;iPad mini&quot;, showing a squared-off device about half the size of a standard iPad with a Lightning connector.  The new eight-pin connector, introduced with the iPhone 5, is incompatible with the 10-year-old connectors used on millions of iPods, iPhones and iPads, as well as accessories. Industry sources indicated to the Guardian that they do not expect to see 3G-capable versions of the iPad mini. That would allow Apple to produce it comparatively cheaply and to limit the top price of the product, while retaining mobile broadband connectivity for its pricier iPad line. Sources also indicated that they expect Apple to refresh the iPad line by following up the introduction of the iPhone 5, which is 4G-capable in the UK through Everything Everywhere&apos;s 1800MHz network \u2013 and from next September with Three \u2013 with revised versions using the same 1800MHz 4G chip and the new connector. Including the new connector on the iPad, iPhone and &quot;iPad mini&quot;, as well as the new iPod Touch which began shipping on Tuesday, would give accessory makers \u2013 who represent a multibillion-pound industry worldwide \u2013 a kickstart to build Lightning-compatible devices. Some analysts have estimated that Apple could sell as many as 10m iPad minis by the end of 2012 if it is released, as some expect, on 2 November. A key factor will be pricing: Amazon&apos;s Kindle Fire and the Nexus 7 are both priced at about $200 in the US, leading analysts to suggest that Apple cannot price the base version of any &quot;iPad mini&quot; above $250 without damaging its chance of selling. Apple has held sway over the tablet market since the first iPad went on sale in April 2010, and still dominates the overall market.

We volunteer our time on Reddit to make it a better place for the users, and should not be harassed and threatened for that. We should all be afraid of the threat of having our personal information investigated and spread around the internet if someone disagrees with you. Reddit prides itself on having a subreddit for everything, and no matter how much anyone may disapprove of what another user subscribes to, that is never a reason to threaten them. As a result, the moderators of /r/politics have chosen to disallow links from the Gawker network until action is taken to correct this serious lack of ethics and integrity.

No Filter: Inside Hipstamatic&apos;s lost year searching for the next killer social app &gt;&gt; Fast Company  Hipstamatic&apos;s journey over the past year has been tumultuous, to say the least. As Fast Company has learned from speaking to more than a dozen players involved, Hipstamatic has wrestled with ever-growing social competition, internal tensions, and a lack of product vision--not to mention juggling acquisition interest and worsening term sheets in a post-Facebook IPO world.  But what the startup has most struggled with is remaining relevant in an unforgiving app market dominated by one of the hottest spaces in tech: photos.   They thought Instagram wasn&apos;t interesting because it was built around &quot;social&quot;, launched a terrible limited-pictures product, and turned down overtures from Twitter.

HTC tablets fade from US market, but firm keeps options open &gt;&gt; FierceWireless  However, [HTC global communications manager Jeff Gordon] acknowledged that Apple&apos;s iPad continues to dominate the tablet market and he said that HTC would only consider returning to the tablet space if it developed a product that could make inroads against the iPad and other tablets.  Gordon said it&apos;s unclear what strategy HTC might take in a possible return to tablets. He said the company could try to tackle the lower-end of the market, as Google has attempted with the Wi-Fi-only Nexus 7, or it could build a more powerful device that would cost more.  &quot;We&apos;re very much not set on one strategy over another,&quot; he said.

His 6\u20134, 6\u20134 victory over the top dog, Roger Federer, took him to the verge of winning the Shanghai Masters for the third straight year, and if anything it was more dominant than the scoreline suggests. Such is the Scot&apos;s confidence, it seems like he is improving almost by the week. Having shrugged off a cold on his way to the semi-finals, the world No3 outgunned Federer with a hugely powerful performance, much as he did when beating the Swiss to win Olympic gold in August. The inner calm earned by winning his first grand slam title at last month&apos;s US Open is visible in all elements of his game and Federer, probably the greatest player of all time, was a distinct and distant second best. These are heady days for British tennis. Three weeks after Laura Robson became the first British woman to reach a WTA Tour final since 1990, Heather Watson matched her effort by reaching the final in Osaka. The 20-year-old was due to take on Chang Kai-cheng of Taiwan in the early hours of Sunday morning, trying to become the first British woman to win a singles title since Sara Gomer in 1988. In final in Shanghai, Murray faces Novak Djokovic, the man he beat in New York. The Serb is in pole position to end the year as No1 and only an injury to the Serb or something spectacular from Federer is likely to deny him his goal. On Saturday, everything that was spectacular came from Murray as he outplayed Federer with a brand of tennis he is now beginning to produce on a regular basis. In the first game, the 25-year-old hit three thunderous groundstrokes to break serve, setting the tone for a match in which Federer was on the back foot throughout. He has always maintained that the match is &quot;on his racket&quot; against Murray, that he is the one dictating. Things have changed. At the Olympics, Murray produced a serving masterclass to deny him; on Saturday, it was a series of brilliant returns and groundstrokes that left the maestro reeling. &quot;I went for it like I did the last few times I played against him,&quot; Murray said. &quot;He didn&apos;t serve that well so I was able to be very aggressive on his second serve. He maybe slowed down his first serve a little bit, so I was able to take a few more chances on the first serve. Obviously that helped.&quot; Murray leads their meetings 10-8 and there is clearly something about him that gets under Federer&apos;s skin. When Federer wanted to go off in the first game of the second set due to a few spots of rain on the court, Murray looked bemused. Both men knew Federer was struggling for answers. Murray had won the first set with the purest of hitting, helped by poor serving from Federer, who, having got the early break back, coughed up three straight double faults to drop serve for a second time in the fifth game. Murray saw out the set with relative ease. That first game of the second set saw Murray push for the kill, but Federer saved seven break points to hold. It might have been a turning point, but from 2\u20132 and with Federer 40\u20130 up on serve, Murray reeled off a string of brilliant returns to get the vital break. At 5\u20134, the players had to wait almost 20 minutes while the roof was closed because of heavier drops of rain, but a nerveless Murray closed out the match. Watson&apos;s run in Osaka is a timely reminder that there is not just one British woman on her way to becoming a top player. Robson has been tipped as a star ever since she won junior Wimbledon in 2008, while Watson has lived in her shadow despite being 18 months older and having broken into the world&apos;s top 100 first. Victory in Osaka would take Watson above Robson in the rankings once more, both of them around the No50 mark. Watson is a superb athlete and hugely consistent; Robson has immense power and great timing. Both are on the up."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/14/heather-watson-japan-open-wta", "publicationDate": "2012-10-14T14:35:05Z", "tags": ["Heather Watson", "Laura Robson", "Sport", "Tennis"], "sentences": ["It has been a long 24 years since Sara Gomer won her title in Aptos, California but now Britain has another female champion after Watson won a nail-biting battle with Chang Kai-cheng of Taiwan to win the Japan Open in Osaka."], "title": "Heather Watson beats Chang Kai-chen in Japan Open to win first WTA title", "article": "Until today, the last time a British woman won a WTA Tour singles title, the Berlin Wall was still standing, Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and Heather Watson was a good four years away from even being born. It has been a long 24 years since Sara Gomer won her title in Aptos, California but now Britain has another female champion after Watson won a nail-biting battle with Chang Kai-cheng of Taiwan to win the Japan Open in Osaka. Three weeks ago, the 18-year-old Laura Robson came within a few games of breaking the British title drought, losing in the final of the WTA event in Guangzhou, China. But while Robson is very much on the rise and has been tipped to go on to win grand slam titles, it was perhaps fitting that it was Watson who should win a title first. The pair have grown up together but for a number of reasons, Watson has been very much in Robson&apos;s shadow, despite being 18 months older, breaking into the top 100 first and now, the top 50. While Robson has the stylish, powerful game that many feel has her destined for the top, Watson relies more on her athleticism and consistency. It might be less spectacular but there is a lot to be said for someone who is strong enough to play more than 15 hours on court, as she did through the week in Osaka. As she matures, she is adding power and as the confidence grows, she is destined to go much higher in the rankings. It took the 20-year-old three hours, 11 minutes to win the final, 7-5, 5-7, 7-6, a rich reward for her resilience and her refusal to let a missed match point at 5-3 in the second set get disrupt her. At 5-4 down and 40-0 down on the Chang serve, it looked like she would suffer the same fate as Robson, but Watson saved them all, then a fourth match point and pinched the tiebreak 7-4 to claim the first of what promises to be many titles. &quot;I was already thinking about how I was going to cry in the locker room,&quot; Watson laughed. &quot;But after I saved the first one, I just took it point by point. I&apos;m really proud of myself for getting through that.&quot; &quot;I was in the changing room afterwards, changing my clothes, and I thought to myself: &apos;Did I really win?&apos; So it&apos;s just starting to settle in. I&apos;ve worked so hard for this moment my whole career \u2013 that&apos;s why I practised so hard, ran all those miles and lifted all those weights, for moments like this. Britain has been breaking quite a few records recently, so I&apos;m happy I could break another one today. I&apos;m proud to do this for my country.&quot; When the new rankings are released on Monday, Watson is projected to move into the world&apos;s top 50 for the first time, a couple of places ahead of Robson. With Andy Murray having won his first grand slam title just last month at the US Open, British tennis is experiencing success it has not known for decades and in Watson and Robson, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to believe that the women could go on to match Murray&apos;s achievements. Neither Watson nor Robson could be considered products of the much-maligned LTA system, having spent the majority of their youth training outside the country. Watson has trained at the academy of Nick Bollettieri, the coach who discovered Andre Agassi, Monica Seles and Maria Sharapova, among others, since she was 12 while Robson spent two years at the Mouratoglou academy in Paris. But it should be noted that the LTA had the vision to part-fund their development, even though it was not being done under its watch at the National Training Centre in London. That they have both come through at the same time is a boon for British tennis and the two players, good friends off the court, have been taking it in turns to enjoy the limelight in recent months. &quot;Laura and I have come through the rankings together \u2013 juniors and seniors \u2013 and we&apos;re both very competitive, so when we see the other doing well, it pushes us,&quot; Watson said. &quot;Knowing Laura did so well in China a few weeks ago definitely motivated me this week. But it&apos;s great we&apos;re really good friends off the court as well.&quot; It is a mark of their success that even the bookmakers are getting in on the act. From the days when the first few days of Wimbledon would see a succession of beaten Brits; now Ladbrokes feel that Watson&apos;s title is the first of many, making her 33-1 to reach a grand slam final in her career. There is a long way to go to make it from the top 50 to the top 10 and be contending for the sport&apos;s four biggest titles, Wimbledon, the US Open, French Open and Australian Open. Both Elena Baltacha and Anne Keothavong have enjoyed brief spells inside the top 50 in recent years. It would be a surprise, though, if Watson and Robson do not far exceed their achievements."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/14/heather-watson-japan-open-chang-kai-chen", "publicationDate": "2012-10-14T18:55:35Z", "tags": ["Heather Watson", "Tennis", "Sport", "Andy Murray"], "sentences": ["After Andy Murray&apos;s triumphs at the Olympics and the US Open, where he broke a 76-year men&apos;s grand slam drought, Watson snapped a 24-year winless streak by beating Chang Kai-chen of Taiwan 7-5, 5-7, 7-6 for the first of what promises to be many titles to come."], "title": "Heather Watson makes history with Japan Open win over Chang Kai-chen", "article": "A lot of history has been made in British tennis lately and on Sunday Heather Watson added her name to the list when she became the first woman from these shores to win a WTA Tour title since 1988 with her victory in the Japan Open in Osaka.

I&apos;m proud to do it for my country and to represent them. Recently, we&apos;ve been breaking quite a lot of records so I&apos;m happy I could break another one today and hopefully I can break some more.&quot; Three weeks ago, the 18-year-old Briton Laura Robson almost pipped her to the post when she reached the final in Guangzhou, China, only to fall in three sets. Watson looked to be heading the same way when Chang served for the match in the third set but she dug deep to save four match points and then clinched victory in a nail-biting final-set tiebreak after three hours, 11 minutes. &quot;I&apos;ve worked so, so hard for this moment, throughout my career,&quot; Watson said. &quot;That&apos;s why I ran all those miles and lifted all those weights, for moments like this.&quot; Born and raised in Guernsey, Watson has trained in the United States, at the Nick Bollettieri academy, since she was 12, part-funded by the Lawn Tennis Association. Bollettieri was the man responsible for discovering Andre Agassi, Maria Sharapova, Monica Seles and Anna Kournikova and Watson is another success story for the American. Watson and Robson are seen as the future of women&apos;s tennis in Britain and the LTA must be hoping that the two players, good friends off the court, could lead to a surge in girls playing the sport, helped not only by their tennis but their outgoing personalities, too. &quot;I didn&apos;t think about that but I&apos;d like to inspire the younger generation to play tennis and to follow their dreams and work hard,&quot; Watson said. &quot;I think I can do that through my tennis by achieving things and showing them that anything&apos;s possible.&quot; Watson will leapfrog Robson in the rankings on Monday , at No50 to Robson&apos;s 52, and the pair are well placed to head towards the top 20 next year. Robson, who does not turn 19 until January, reached the fourth round of the US Open while Watson made the third round at Wimbledon this summer.

Pondering Whatsapp &gt;&gt; Benedict Evans  None of this is especially scientific, but taken together, it seems pretty clear that WhatsApp has well over 100m active users, and possible 2-300m. Skype, incidentally, has 254m MAUs [monthly active users].  In other words, WhatsApp has several times more users than Instagram had when Facebook bought it for what was then $1bn. With a staff of just 35, plus outsourced development in Russia, that&apos;s a testament to the scaling possibilities of app stores - and suggests that M&amp;A industry is pretty much camped out in the WhatsApp offices.   WhatsApp also has revenue, which Instagram famously did not, though how much is even more opaque.   WhatsApp may be the biggest app that many people over 25 haven&apos;t heard of. Limited use of sharing buttons shows people&apos;s desire to share links privately &gt;&gt; Poynter  AddThis, which provides sharing tools embedded on 10 million websites, says between 70 and 95 percent of all link-sharing occurs by copying and pasting a URL, not by clicking a button on the page.  In some cases this has the same effect, if someone copies and pastes a URL into Twitter instead of clicking the embedded tweet button. But the data also show the hidden but popular practice of sharing links privately with specific people over email or IM, said Greg Cypes, director of product for AddThis parent company Clearspring Technologies.  &quot;The desire for people to share one-to-one or one-to-few ... is much much greater than we originally expected it to be,&quot; Cypes said.  Dark Social: we have the whole history of the web wrong &gt;&gt; The Atlantic Alexis C. Madrigal:   Here&apos;s a pocket history of the web, according to many people. In the early days, the web was just pages of information linked to each other. Then along came web crawlers that helped you find what you wanted among all that information. Some time around 2003 or maybe 2004, the social web really kicked into gear, and thereafter the web&apos;s users began to connect with each other more and more often. Hence Web 2.0, Wikipedia, MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, etc. I&apos;m not strawmanning here. This is the dominant history of the web as seen, for example, in this Wikipedia entry on the &apos;Social Web.&apos;  But it&apos;s never felt quite right to me. For one, I spent most of the 90s as a teenager in rural Washington and my web was highly, highly social.   The social networks you can name aren&apos;t the ones that actually send people to sites. A few words on Reddit, Gawker, and anonymity &gt;&gt; Popehat  Let me put it this way: I would not let the moderators and fans of the Reddit creeper forums around my daughters; I&apos;d worry they would sexually assault the girls. I don&apos;t worry about Gawker writers and editors molesting my girls. However, if my girls were molested, I&apos;d expect Gawker writers and editors to try to find ways to monetize it, use it to drive traffic, come up with banal, weakly ironic hipster-douchebag quips about it, pay witnesses to offer lurid details about it, and try to find clumsy and demi-literate ways to connect it to politicians they don&apos;t like.  The Internet Is Not Private: You&apos;re a fool if you think it is.

If Google launches such a US$99 tablet, China-based white-box vendors of inexpensive tablets are expected to be under heavy competitive pressure, the sources pointed out.   Not really - surely it would be Google that would come under pressure, since those cheap tablet makers are playing in that price space already. Google might have to swallow a loss or razor-thin margin on each device it sold. That&apos;s not a long-term or a volume strategy, and wouldn&apos;t please OEMs either.

The shares rose more than 8% in early trading, before closing up less than 1% at \u20ac2.20 as bad news about handsets was balanced by a turnaround at Nokia Siemens Networks. The subsidiary, which makes telecoms equipment, swung back into profit after making more than 14,000 job cuts and reducing its product lines to concentrate on mobile rather than fixed line networks. Once the mobile market leader, Nokia has lost almost 90% of its stock market value since Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007. On Thursday it reported its sixth straight quarter of losses since adopting Microsoft&apos;s Windows phone software. Third quarter sales fell to \u20ac7.2bn, better than analysts were forecasting but down from nearly \u00a39bn in the third quarter of 2011, as smartphone shipments withered by 10m to 6.3m units. Overall shipments fell 22% to 83m, with only 300,000 phones sold in North America. Devices sales fell in every region except Latin America, with takings in China collapsing from \u20ac1.2bn to \u20ac300m. A spokesman said this was due to a switch in strategy by Chinese mobile networks, which have begun subsidising handsets but are generally pushing models with a lower cost than those made by Nokia. The group&apos;s Lumia smartphones, which run on Microsoft&apos;s operating system, declined in popularity with global shipments falling to 2.9m units, down from 4m in the second quarter. Customers have stayed away because only the new Lumia models, which Elop confirmed would be released in a &quot;select&quot; number of markets in November, will be able to run the latest version of Windows Phone software, due to be released by Microsoft on 29 October. The decision to push Lumia in just a few markets before Christmas means Nokia can concentrate its marketing firepower, but the company warned fourth quarter smartphone volumes would not see the usual seasonal uplift. &quot;New products will ship halfway through the quarter into an overwhelmingly competitive and congested market,&quot; warned Geoff Blaber at mobile research firm CCS Insight.

Sales to third parties such as Amazon and Yahoo! were \u20ac180m in the quarter. Elop brushed aside suggestions that Nokia&apos;s special relationship with Microsoft was threatened by Taiwan&apos;s HTC. Microsoft chief executive Steven Ballmer made a personal appearance last month at the launch of HTC&apos;s new range, which the company is calling Windows Phone 8 as it attempts to establish its handsets as the truest expression of the Windows operating system. Microsoft pays Nokia $250m a quarter in marketing money, which more than offsets software royalty payments back to Microsoft, and Windows uses Nokia maps. &quot;The fact that Microsoft has a critical dependency on us for location based services highlights the importance of this relationship working well in both directions,&quot; said Elop."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/19/microsoft-profits-slump", "publicationDate": "2012-10-18T23:29:01Z", "tags": ["Microsoft", "Computing", "Technology", "Windows 8", "Software", "Windows Phone", "Mobile phones", "Smartphones", "Nokia", "Xbox", "Games", "Business", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Its arrival will be followed in November by new handsets using the operating system from Finland&apos;s Nokia and Taiwan&apos;s HTC."], "title": "Microsoft suffers steep fall in profits", "article": "Microsoft has suffered a worse than expected 24% fall in profits, but chief executive Steven Ballmer countered by promising a &quot;new era&quot; for the world&apos;s largest software company as it prepares to fight for a share of the mobile computing goldrush with next week&apos;s launch of Windows 8. Wall Street was braced for a contraction after news that PC sales were down 8% in a quarter as consumer spending switches from the desktop to tablets and phones. Microsoft obliged by announcing a year-on-year fall in first quarter profits before tax from $7.3bn (\u00a34.5bn) to $5.5bn and revenues of $16 billion, the lowest reported since March 2010. Income from its Windows division fell to $3.2bn, the worst performance in three years. The best selling software&apos;s most radical redesign since Windows 95 has seen its interface reinvented for the touch screen, and its arrival today will be accompanied by the launch of the Surface tablet, Microsoft&apos;s answer to the iPad. &quot;The launch of Windows 8 is the beginning of a new era at Microsoft,&quot; said Ballmer. &quot;Investments we&apos;ve made over a number of years are now coming together to create a future of exceptional devices and services.&quot; On Monday 29 October, Microsoft will make a concerted push into the smartphone industry with the unveiling of Windows Phone 8. Its arrival will be followed in November by new handsets using the operating system from Finland&apos;s Nokia and Taiwan&apos;s HTC. It is an alliance that spans three continents, and to which the fortunes of all three companies are closely tied. Admitting the PC market was &quot;challenging&quot;, Microsoft finance director Peter Klein said the company was preparing for the &quot;largest launch wave in our history&quot;. Revenues from other divisions have held up, with sales of servers and tools rising 8% to $4.5bn, while the Xbox games console helped revenues from entertainment and devices hold firm at $1.9bn. The number of calls on Skype, the online phonebox acquired by Microsoft last year, rocketed 58% to 120bn minutes. &quot;Investors were not expecting a home run,&quot; said analyst Daniel Ives at FBR Capital Markets. &quot;All expectations are on the launch of Windows 8 and the entrance into the tablet market. In light of the environment, the macro and PC situation, these are respectable numbers.&quot; Nokia will be hoping Microsoft&apos;s Windows marketing push delivers an uplift for its beleaguered smartphone business. Announcing results for the three months to 30 September, the Finnish group revealed on Thursday it has burned through \u20ac633m (\u00a3514m) of cash in three months, with sales falling by 20% in a year, thanks to sluggish demand for its smartphones and a near \u20ac1bn collapse in takings from China. Nokia has spent almost a third of its cash reserves in 12 months, and has \u20ac3.6bn left to fund its transformation into a smartphone maker capable of competing with Apple and Samsung. At its current rate of spending, those reserves will have vanished by March 2014. &quot;The big investor concern is that Nokia might run out of cash before Windows phone builds a successful following,&quot; said analyst Mark Sue at RBC Capital markets. Nokia has lost almost 90% of its value since Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007. Yesterday it reported its sixth straight quarter of losses since dumping its own Symbian phone software and adopting Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone. Third quarter sales fell to \u20ac7.2bn, better than analysts were forecasting but down from nearly \u00a39bn in the third quarter of 2011, as smartphone shipments withered by 10m to 6.3m units.

He was already using one as his everyday computer, he said, and predicted that within five years it would be &quot;the most popular form of PC sold in America&quot;. But that was in November 2001, and the stylus-operated Tablet PC launched a year later sank without a trace. This week, with the consumer release of Windows 8 and its matching Surface tablet, Microsoft is trying again. To highlight its biggest new product since Windows 95, Microsoft is mobilising the kind of advertising budget rarely seen outside US presidential election campaigns, estimated at up to $1.8bn. Sales of PCs are declining, meaning the world&apos;s largest software company badly needs a popular vote for its move into mobile devices. &quot;The future of personal computing is moving definitively away from PCs towards smartphones and tablets, and while Microsoft is extremely strong in PCs it has no meaningful presence in mobile devices,&quot; says digital forecaster Benedict Evans at Enders Analysis. These smaller, more portable computers can take photos, edit and share them. They can play music, or TV shows, display books and newspapers, search the internet, and offer faster, more sofa-friendly ways of emailing friends, online shopping and checking Facebook updates. &quot;The number of people who can do all or most of what they want to do on a tablet or a smartphone is growing,&quot; warns Evans. &quot;That feeds into people using PCs less and spending less money on them.&quot; There are around 1.3bn PCs running Windows software around the world, more than the 1bn smartphones Strategy Analytics estimates are in use today. Microsoft controls 95% of the PC market, but that market has shrunk 8% since last year globally, and by an even steeper 14% in the US, which sets the trend. It is a trend that is denting the business models of much younger companies than Microsoft. Internet-age giants like Google and Facebook are feeling the impact too. Facebook&apos;s users are moving from the desktop to the smartphone, while its advertisers have been slower to make the transition. Apps on phones and tablets bypass search engines to provide a more direct link to internet content, which has translated into a decline in the average price paid by advertisers for each click from a Google user. It was this, as much as a clerical error that saw Google&apos;s financial results published three hours ahead of schedule, that sent the company&apos;s share price into freefall last Thursday. Google saw this trend coming years ago, and its response was Android \u2013 free phone software for handset makers to use, to give it a presence in mobile as well as on desktops. What has changed is that the flow of traffic onto mobile is finally beginning to show up in Google&apos;s numbers. As it invests to adapt, for example by buying loss-making handset maker Motorola, profits are being squeezed. &quot;While the search cash cow continues to pay, the costs of shifting the revenue mix are depressing the income,&quot; says professor Ajay Bhalla at Cass Business School. &quot;The results indicate that Google executives are trying to avoid the mistakes made by Microsoft as it became increasingly reliant on a handful of products.&quot; Despite Gates&apos;s enthusiasm, Microsoft has been slower to respond to the shift to mobile and is nowhere in tablets. Windows Phone software was brought up to date two years ago, with distinctive live tiles to represent apps instead of static icons. It has been well received by the few who have used it. But the work of making Windows Phone software famous has been left to handset manufacturers, mainly Taiwan&apos;s HTC and Finland&apos;s Nokia, which has so far sucked up $1bn in marketing support from Microsoft, to little avail. Windows Phone has a mere 3% market share. This has not stopped Microsoft using Windows Phone as the design inspiration for its new PC software, which will run in almost identical form on tablet computers, and was really created with the touch screen in mind. The tablet version is so crucial to Microsoft that the firm has decided showcasing it cannot be trusted to outsiders, and will make Surface in-house. But the tablet may be more of a display model than a profit generator. Microsoft may not intend to sell that many. At \u00a3479, including the keyboard that also doubles as a cover, it does not come cheap. In the UK, it will only be available via Microsoft&apos;s website, so no Dixons or John Lewis displays. Trendforce predicts shipments of only 2.5m in 2012, compared with 84m iPads sold since 2010. Whatever its ambitions, the move back into hardware is a brave one for Microsoft, whose occasional attempts to fuse computing brains and brawn have ended in more misses than hits. For every Xbox games console, there is an unsold Zune music player. The company is taking an even bigger risk with Windows 8. Those who have used it say it works well on the touch screen, but is more awkward to navigate with a mouse and keyboard. The start button has disappeared, and the functions it used to house, like word processing or search, are now hidden at the sides of the screen. They are only revealed when the mouse hovers over them. Rather than bringing its phone software to tablets and leaving PCs alone, as Apple has done, Microsoft wants a common interface for all three screens in the hope that its millions of PC customers will follow it onto other devices. The move should make life easier for apps developers too. But there is a risk. &quot;If consumers find Windows 8 not very appealing, both Microsoft and PC vendors could face further declines in PC sales as consumers spend their money on other devices,&quot; warns Gartner analyst Annette Jump. If the launch is a success, Jump says we will start seeing Windows in new formats like touch-screen notebooks or so called &quot;all in ones&quot; \u2013 widescreen computers with built-in hard drives that maybe sit in the kitchen, displaying films, photos and recipes. Those who remember Microsoft&apos;s 2002 tablet PC say it failed because the company expected it to be used for word processing and spreadsheets. By contrast the was marketed as a &quot;kick back and relax&quot; computer \u2013 the adverts showed users with their feet up. Windows 8 will try to merge work and leisure. Even the tablets will come with the Office suite, so that live tiles showing a friend&apos;s social network updates will sit next to word documents. While the strategy is seen as a sensible one, some believe it is already too late for Microsoft. Technology writer Stasys Bielinis of UnwiredView.com accuses the company of having clung to the PC, focusing on profits over users. &quot;The users wised up, competition rose up, and we have broken the chains that bound us to Microsoft for the past 20\u00a0years,&quot; he says. Windows 8 is not Microsoft&apos;s last hurrah. Unlike Nokia, which will run out of money in two years if it continues to burn cash at its current rate, the company which made Gates the richest man in the world is still highly profitable and has $66bn in the kitty. But with the PC in decline, it cannot afford to give up on mobile computing."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/21/ofm-awards-newcomers-young-turks", "publicationDate": "2012-10-20T23:25:00Z", "tags": ["Chefs", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "sentences": ["James Lowe took the summer off to do a chef&apos;s Grand Tour \u2013 &quot;China for a month, Taiwan, Italy for a few weeks, Copenhagen, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia&quot; \u2013 and and now he too is looking to start up a restaurant of his own in east London."], "title": "Observer Food Monthly Awards 2012 Best Newcomer: Young Turks", "article": "The winners of this year&apos;s newcomer award are more like a rock band than a restaurant. The name refers not to a bricks-and-mortar establishment but to a collective of chefs who are, aptly enough, young, ambitious and healthily iconoclastic. They make fleeting appearances at unconventional venues, keeping fans in the loop on Twitter. If you caught them last summer at a disused office building in Canary Wharf, or on the roof of a car park in Peckham where they reimagined dishes for a Turkish ocakbasi grill, count yourself lucky: these events have acquired semi-legendary status in the London food world. Last October, we had a chance to get to know James Lowe and Isaac McHale a little better when they settled down for a six-month residency above the Ten Bells pub in Spitalfields. Here, they had a chance to cook food that was inventive and daring without being flashy in a room that had none of the hush and formality you associate with fine dining (you had to cross the crowded floor of the pub and climb a narrow, creaky staircase to get to it). Since then, they&apos;ve been touring their talents around the world, to Mexico City, Shanghai and New York, where last month they did a successful turn at the prestigious Le Fooding event. For all their unconventional working habits and punkish attitude, however, the Young Turks are not quite as radical as they sound. They became chefs the usual way, paying dues in high-pressure kitchens, albeit rapidly. Thirty-three-year-old Lowe cooked at La Trompette and the Fat Duck before becoming, at 26, head chef at St John Bread &amp; Wine. McHale, 32, worked at the Ledbury in west London for five years and did a stint at Noma in Copenhagen. A third member, Ben Greeno, also worked at Noma, but dropped out of the Turks to work for David Chang at Momofuku Seiobo in Sydney. The Young Turks formed when Lowe, McHale and Greeno were invited separately to guest-chef at the influential Loft Project supper club in east London. &quot;We shared views on the London food scene and food in general,&quot; Lowe tells me. &quot;Each of us was keeping a close eye on what was happening abroad \u2013 in the States and Japan and around Europe \u2013 whereas many British chefs were still very inward-looking.&quot; &quot;We had various ideals,&quot; says McHale. &quot;Eating more vegetables, paring things back a bit, sharing ideas instead of being secretive.&quot; Reclaiming neglected British ingredients and updating antique recipes were other areas of common ground. One of Lowe&apos;s most successful dishes, when the Young Turks returned to the Loft in spring 2011, was a very traditional British pairing of beef and oysters, but served raw with chickweed. Although founded on honest food philosophies and serious talent, the Young Turks had astute marketing: the swaggering identity and the shrewd use of social media guaranteed column inches as well as bookings. Both are now working on solo projects. McHale is preparing to open a permanent restaurant at Shoreditch Town Hall in January \u2013 he&apos;s calling it the Clove Club. Again, social media has proved invaluable to his progress: using the crowdfunding website Crowdcube, McHale raised \u00a3250,000 from 50 donors to help get the project started. Meanwhile, he has kept the Ten Bells restaurant going. It&apos;s no longer officially a Young Turks operation \u2013 young ex-Ledbury chef Giorgio Ravelli is in charge of the kitchen \u2013 but some of McHale&apos;s dishes, including his justly famous buttermilk chicken and pine salt, are still on the menu. James Lowe took the summer off to do a chef&apos;s Grand Tour \u2013 &quot;China for a month, Taiwan, Italy for a few weeks, Copenhagen, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia&quot; \u2013 and and now he too is looking to start up a restaurant of his own in east London. Does this signal the end of the Young Turks? No, McHale says, though he admits the relationship may change. &quot;It was never a till-death-do-us-part arrangement, it was a springboard to us finding our own sites. It went better than we expected \u2013 but we have to be true to our own identities and do our own things.&quot; Young Turks projects will continue to happen \u2013 they will be cooking in Turin at the end of October \u2013 albeit less frequently, and McHale and Lowe remain enthusiastic about their alliance. According to McHale, last month&apos;s Le Fooding extravaganza in New York was &quot;the most fun foreign event we&apos;ve done. We were nervous when we started doing them but now it&apos;s less nerves, more enjoyment \u2013 and it helped that everyone seemed to have heard of us. We&apos;re proud of the things we&apos;ve done together as Young Turks,&quot; he adds. &quot;Hopefully, this is only really the beginning.&quot; youngturks.co.uk; thecloveclub.com; tenbells.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/23/jailing-italian-seismologists-scientific-community", "publicationDate": "2012-10-23T17:29:43Z", "tags": ["Italy", "Earthquakes", "Science", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Europe", "World news"], "sentences": ["In his Encyclopedia of Hurricanes, Typhoons, and Cyclones, David Longshore writes that, in the 1960s, four Taiwanese meteorologists who failed to predict the landfall of a deadly typhoon were arrested and charged with &quot;dereliction of duty&quot;."], "title": "Jailing of Italian seismologists leaves scientific community in shock", "article": "One was a flamboyant Tuscan astronomer hailed by some as the father of modern science; the other is a one-time BBC weatherman from Eastbourne.

Regarded as scapegoats for a storm that claimed 330 lives, he writes, the forecasters were eventually released. Aside from that, there is little historical precedent for the punishment meted out to the seven members of Italy&apos;s National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Major Risks, which they are appealing. Judge Marco Billi&apos;s ruling has provoked stupefaction and warnings of a dangerous example having been set in Italy for scientists involved in hazard prediction. &quot;Next time there&apos;s a seismic crisis and they convene a panel to advise on what best to do, who is going to be willing to go on that panel if they face six years in jail if they get it wrong?&quot; said David Rothery, a senior lecturer in earth sciences at the Open University. He and several others have drawn attention to volcanologists observing the behaviour of Mount Vesuvius, the volcano near Naples whose eruption \u2013 if it comes \u2013 could necessitate the evacuation of nearby Naples. &quot;The question being asked by people is: what is this going to do for future relations between the scientific community and the public and state?&quot; said Roger Musson of the British Geological Survey. &quot;One can imagine that, next time there are rumblings heard from Vesuvius, Italian volcanologists are going to be reluctant to make any statement because they have no guarantee that they won&apos;t find themselves arrested if they say one thing and it turns out to be another.&quot; Headlines suggesting the L&apos;Aquila seven have been prosecuted and convicted purely for having failed to predict the earthquake have caused irritation among scientific circles, where it is well established that the business of forecasting the movements of the earth&apos;s tectonic plates is far from an exact science. &quot;For several decades now, scientists have been trying to find a foolproof way of predicting earthquakes, but entirely without success,&quot; writes Bill McGuire, professor of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London, on Comment is Free. &quot;We can get some idea of how often a quake will occur on a particular fault by checking the timing of previous shocks, and this will allow us to determine a window \u2013 which is likely to be several years or even decades wide \u2013 during which a future earthquake is likely to happen. Such &apos;probabilistic forecasting&apos; is not, however, the same as being able to say definitively that there will be an earthquake next Saturday afternoon at teatime.&quot; Prosecutors in the seismologists&apos; case say they were well aware of this; their argument was that deaths in the earthquake could have been avoided had people not been reassured by one of the experts that the situation was &quot;normal&quot; and that they should stay in the area. On the issue of communication, then, Musson said the case should be &quot;carefully examined&quot; for any lessons to be learned. But opinion is virtually unanimous that, whatever shortcomings there may have been, a criminal courtroom is no place for them to be settled, and a prison cell is no place for world-renowned scientists to rue the day they called it wrong. &quot;These people should have been spending their time since 2009 working on earthquakes and how to improve the hazard warnings, and instead they have been distracted by the trial, and now they are going to be distracted by the appeal,&quot; says Rothery. &quot;And that&apos;s not going to help the science of earthquake prediction and mitigation in Italy or anywhere in the world.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 24 October 2012 to correct the statement that seven Italian seismologists were convicted of manslaughter."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/25/brazil-answer-ipad-mini-internet", "publicationDate": "2012-10-25T12:10:09Z", "tags": ["Tablet computers", "Brazil", "iPad", "iPad mini", "Apple", "Computing", "Technology", "China"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s Foxconn, which assembles products for Apple and others, is moving more of its operations from China."], "title": "Brazil's answer to iPad mini brings internet to hundreds of thousands", "article": "Apple&apos;s launch of a smaller, cheaper iPad this week generated a global hullabaloo, but for one Chinese businessman in Brazil, it cannot have seemed quite so extraordinary. Paulo Xu had been there and done that \u2013 a year earlier and for half the price \u2013 with a 300-reais (\u00a3100) tablet computer that has brought the internet into hundreds of thousands of low-income homes for the first time. The technology may have been less advanced, but the simple device showed how new combinations of manufacturing nous and marketing opportunities are changing the face of the electronics industry in emerging economies. With the European market in crisis and production costs rising in China, Latin America is an increasingly attractive proposition for many major firms seeking new areas of growth. In recent weeks, BMW, Foxconn and Hyundai have announced major new investments in Brazil. Xu arrived many years earlier and has since built one of Brazil&apos;s fastest growing computer companies. Born Xu Wei to a middle-class family in Nantong, Jiangsu province, he came to Brazil in 1994, adopted the name Paulo, and started out in the kitchen of a Japanese restaurant, where he says he worked 17 hours a day and earned 450 reais a month. But like his idol, Li Ka Shing \u2013 Asia&apos;s richest man \u2013 he had ambitions to become an entrepreneur. Xu opened a restaurant, then a gift shop, then moved into consumer electronics by forming a new company, Digital Life, in 2004. He started out with car audio equipment and moved into the tablet business a few years ago, getting technical advice from manufacturers in China. Many components are made in his homeland, but all the assembly work is done in Brazil, which enables him to qualify for generous tax breaks. To avoid competition with higher-end devices made by multinational brands, Digital Life aims at the growing niche of low-income consumers. Thanks to strong economic growth, government wealth redistribution polices and \u2013 sometimes alarmingly \u2013 extended credit lines, this group are starting to buy smartphones, motorbikes and other products that were unavailable to them before. Digital Life&apos;s cheapest tablet computer, which retails for 300 reais (\u00a393), has an 800 MHz processor, four gigabytes of memory, an 18cm (7in) screen and a wireless modem. Unusually for a tablet, it also has a port for a cable connection because many purchasers do not want to pay extra for routers. Despite a slowdown of the Brazilian economy in 2012 to about 2%, Xu expects sales of his low-price tablet to increase tenfold this year to 1m units, and to rise to 2.5m by 2014. &quot;When it comes to the Chinese and Brazilian markets, my advice is to bet on the economy and work honestly. That always gives a return,&quot; he says. His business owes much to the model that made China the workshop of the world: importing hi-tech components from overseas and assembling them cheaply. In his case, this is being done on a medium scale at a factory in Minas Gerais. But multinationals are starting to follow suit. With costs rising in China and the Latin American market growing, several big manufacturers are expanding their operations in Brazil. Taiwan&apos;s Foxconn, which assembles products for Apple and others, is moving more of its operations from China. Since opening its first factory in Brazil last year, it has ramped up production. Last month, it announced a 1bn reais plan to build its seventh plant in Brazil. The megafacility in S\u00e3o Paulo will assemble smartphones and tablet computers and provide 10,000 jobs. China&apos;s Chery Automobile recently unveiled a $400m investment in a new factory in S\u00e3o Paulo that will have the capacity to produce 150,000 vehicles per year once it is finished towards the end of 2013. This week, BMW announced plans to build its first car plant in Latin America. Construction will begin next April on the $264 factory in Araquari. South Korea&apos;s Hyundai and Samsung are also working on new factories in Brazil. Brazil is in dire need of more manufacturing to rebalance an economy that is over-reliant on exports of commodities such as soy, iron ore and oil. China is its main customer for raw materials and greatest competitor for manufactured goods. For most of the past decade, cheap Chinese goods have dominated. This has been a similar story in much of Latin America, but there are signs that this may be changing as the costs of doing business in China start to rise because of improved labour regulations and a stronger currency. According to a recent study by JP Morgan, labour costs in Mexico and China are now almost equal \u2013 a dramatic change since 2003, when the latter was three times cheaper. But Brazil still has to catch up. Compared with China, Xu says, Brazil has more bureaucracy, less developed supply chains and weaker industrial promotion policies. Nonetheless, with the Chinese market more saturated and competitive, he sees the greatest future opportunities in Brazil. &quot;The Brazilian market is very big and diverse because Brazilians like new things, especially technology. Chinese consumers are more conservative,&quot; he says. &quot;All the expansions that we are planning will be made right here in Brazil.&quot; Additional reporting by Carolina Massote \u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2012 to correct Paulo Xu&apos;s given name."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/26/samsung-apple-smartphones-q3-2012", "publicationDate": "2012-10-26T08:58:56Z", "tags": ["Smartphones", "Samsung", "Apple", "BlackBerry corporation", "BlackBerry", "Nokia", "Windows Phone", "Android", "Google", "Technology", "Mobile phones", "iPhone"], "sentences": ["China&apos;s ZTE pushed into fourth spot, its first time in the top five smartphone vendors, with 7.5m, an 83% growth on the year-ago quarter, while Taiwan&apos;s HTC was pushed down to fifth place with 7.3m, down from 12.7m a year ago."], "title": "Samsung dominates quarterly smartphone shipments as Nokia crashes", "article": "Nokia crashed out of the top three smartphone makers for the first time ever, while Samsung&apos;s domination of the smartphone segment continued in the third quarter of 2012, as the Korean company shipped an estimated 56.3m devices worldwide, according to the research company IDC. Overall, the segment grew by 45% to 179.7m shipments - of which Apple and Samsung together made up 46.3%, continuing their domination of the space. Both grew substantially, with Samsung doubling its shipments and Apple upping its figures by 57% to 26.9m. But BlackBerry-maker RIM and the Finnish company Nokia both saw numbers and market share fall, said IDC. Though RIM was the third-biggest in the sector, it only shipped 7.7m devices, down from 11.8m a year ago, and Nokia fell out of the top three smartphone sellers for the first time ever, with just 6.3m smartphones. The broader market for all mobile phones grew by just 2.4% to 444.5m, meaning that smartphones were 40.4% of all phone shipments - a record share.     Smartphone sales are growing rapidly as a percentage of overall mobile sales, hitting 40% in Q3. Source: IDC    Though IDC did not give mobile OS share figures, almost all of Samsung&apos;s shipments are believed to have been using Google&apos;s Android OS. That, allied with other vendors&apos; use of the OS, suggests Android had a share of more than 70%, and perhaps as high as 75%. Apple&apos;s OS share was 15%, up from 13.8% a year ago, while RIM&apos;s dropped to 4.3%. Nokia is the biggest Windows Phone vendor, though both Samsung and HTC are also vendors, but have not broken out those figures.  The trend indicates the continuing squeeze by the two biggest companies on the rest of the smartphone market, especially on the midrange suppliers. China&apos;s ZTE pushed into fourth spot, its first time in the top five smartphone vendors, with 7.5m, an 83% growth on the year-ago quarter, while Taiwan&apos;s HTC was pushed down to fifth place with 7.3m, down from 12.7m a year ago. Samsung does not provide official figures for its smartphone shipments or revenues, leading analysts to estimate them. Apple announced its figures during its quarterly results on Thursday. Another research company, ABI Research, put the shipment figure for the quarter at 55.5m in a total smartphone market of 155.5m. ABI Research also put ZTE ahead of RIM, at 8.3m over 7.4m, and HTC&apos;s shipments notably lower at 6m. &quot;Nokia&apos;s share losses have meant gains for competitors,&quot; said Kevin Restivo, IDC&apos;s senior research analyst. &quot;The company&apos;s transition away from Symbian-powered smartphones to ones shipped with Windows Phone has left ample opportunity for rivals to steal share away from Nokia over the past 18 months.&quot; But Restivo called the smartphone market &quot;relatively nascent&quot; suggesting there was &quot;room for multiple vendors and operating systems to flourish, including Nokia.&quot; Nokia retained its position in the top mobile handset makers with 82.9m shipments, but the sector was still dominated by Samsung with 105.4m shipments. Apple was the third-largest mobile handset maker with its 26.9m figure.     Featurephone sales are shrinking while smartphone sales are growing rapidly.

Nevertheless, I\u00a0do still trawl the internet \u2013 not for ideas as much as to try and give these ramblings a semblance of authority. I do this by intermittently monitoring websites dedicated to fashion. That&apos;s not to say that I\u00a0just rip off their features \u2013 far from it. I regularly find myself scoffing at their recommendations. And rarely more so than this month, because there seems to be a\u00a0proliferation of &quot;distressed&quot; clothing and footwear. Which I\u00a0detest. I mean, why would you buy a new item of clothing or footwear that looks knackered? I just don&apos;t get it. I\u00a0agree that many things \u2013 jeans, some jackets, leather wallets \u2013 look better when &quot;worn-in&quot;, but they should be worn in by you, not by a\u00a0machine. Without wanting to get too philosophical (they&apos;re just clothes, after all), that is a\u00a0soulless way of doing things. Apart from anything else, I don&apos;t want to wear a pair of &quot;army boots&quot; that look as if they&apos;ve been through a war because I don&apos;t want to risk having conversations that go like this: &quot;Wow, look at those boots. You must have had those for ages? I&apos;ll bet they could tell some stories\u2026&quot; &quot;Well, no. I bought them last week and a robot with sandpaper on its arm in a Gucci factory in Taiwan rubbed it and all its friends in exactly the same places for exactly the same amount of time.&quot; Cool anecdote, huh? All that&apos;s required is a little patience. Waiting for your jeans to scuff and stretch and fray. Yes, it will take a while, but dark denim jeans look better with every wash and bout of horseplay. If you&apos;re not the waiting-type, you can buy things that wear out very quickly. Which brings me, inevitably, on to suede. It&apos;s the neediest of all materials. I\u00a0love suede shoes \u2013 the look, the feel, the way that the suede can take the edge off an otherwise very formal bit of footwear. Until recently I&apos;ve been obsessive about trying to keep them in pristine condition. But the fact is, maintenance is nigh on impossible. Brushing never quite works; none of those bloody sprays offers any significant protection \u2013 and I say that as a man who has been a slave to the heavy post-purchase application. I\u00a0go through suede shoes faster than \u2013 well, definitely faster than I should. However, I have finally found peace. I have realised that suede shoes (and jackets) with stains and markings actually look good. Preferable, even. Including beige ones. So I&apos;ve loosened right up. I&apos;ve been wearing my Hudson suede Derbys in all weathers. They look great for it. And for the less adventurous, a black pair can take a fair bit of punishment without showing so much damage. I&apos;ve just got my hands (feet) on a pair of Clarks Preston desert boots in black. I&apos;m going to trash them! In a good way.

Back then, the heads, who &quot;met&quot; on Twitter and decided to form a pressure group, had held their inaugural meeting at the Guardian&apos;s offices, but had yet to give themselves a name. Though many of its members were already highly active on Twitter, the group itself had not yet been established on the social network. Within a day, it had both a moniker \u2013 Headteachers&apos; Roundtable \u2013 and a Twitter account: @HeadsRoundtable. And the response, says member John Tomsett, head of Huntington school in York, has been &quot;phenomenal&quot;. Within four hours of the Twitter account being set up last Tuesday evening, it had 1,000 followers. By Friday, the number had risen to 2,500, a figure that even prolific education tweeters can take years to build. Although the group \u2013 which has set up a &quot;six-point plan&quot; of proposals centring on accountability, assessment and curriculum \u2013 is being cagey about its possible level of influence on policymakers, the indications are that it has piqued the interest of politicians on both sides of the main party divide. Within hours of our report appearing, Tomsett had been invited to a discussion event next week at which Liz Truss (pictured), the schools and early years minister, will be present. And Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary, is to attend a meeting of the roundtable group next month. &quot;We are very encouraged, and hope members of all political parties will meet us,&quot; says Tomsett. Harder tests, fewer teachers Plans for seemingly tougher new maths, English and reasoning tests for trainee teachers from next year made headlines at the end of last week, with the government&apos;s move leading Radio 4&apos;s Today programme on Friday. Much was made of the current high pass rate of existing tests, which the new ones are to replace, with the figure of 98% quoted \u2013 though this includes those trainee teachers who re-take. So the government wants to make the tests harder, taking their difficulty level from roughly the equivalent of a GCSE grade C to grade B. But if the tests are made harder so that the pass rate falls, what will be the impact on the supply of teachers in the future? The government&apos;s official document sounds a rather sketchily outlined warning. Noting that only 60-70% of current postgraduate teacher trainees have grade Bs in English, and in maths, it warns that 35-40% &quot;might not pass tests set at the level of grade B if they were to take them&quot;. Accordingly, given that, presumably, this could cause a drop in teacher numbers, the rise in the difficulty level is going to be &quot;phased in&quot; from 2013, not reaching the B-grade equivalent until 2015. With little detail on how more trainees are to be supported to pass by then, or on the impact on teacher supply if pass rates fall dramatically, we do wonder if this could end messily. The report was commissioned by the Department for Education from a group of heads and educationists. Education Guardian wonders how pleased Michael Gove will be about an annex to it though, by Dr Alison Kitson and Prof Chris Husbands, of London University&apos;s Institute of Education, which analyses how countries that do well in international tests approach this issue. Having looked at arrangements in seven political jurisdictions \u2013 Finland, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and Ontario in Canada \u2013 the annex concludes that none has pre-training testing arrangements for teachers that are similar to those either already existing, or being proposed, for England. The report also concludes: &quot;Teacher training is solely led by universities across all the countries included in this report, with the exception of New Zealand, where there are a small number of private providers.&quot; This seems unlikely to have been music to the ears of the education secretary, who has made great play of learning from international &quot;high performers&quot; while also seeking to reduce the influence of universities over teacher education. Up with Downhills! A parent at the former Downhills school, the primary in Haringey, north London, that became a focal point for resistance against being forced into academy status by the education secretary, Michael Gove, is fighting on against its takeover by the Harris chain. Susan Moyse, who has a daughter at the school, lost a claim for judicial review in August against the school re-opening as the renamed Harris Primary Academy Philip Lane. She is now seeking leave to appeal against the verdict, even though two months have passed since the school began life under the Harris Federation. Meanwhile, the school was forced to take down graffiti (pictured) earlier this term reflecting the fact that at least one member of the local community seems not to have accepted its new name."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/30/how-become-whisky-malt-master", "publicationDate": "2012-10-30T09:39:05Z", "tags": ["Work & careers", "Money", "Whisky", "Food & drink", "Food & drink industry", "Life and style", "Business"], "sentences": ["I&apos;ve also travelled overseas to meet clients in markets such as the US, Taiwan, Paris, Singapore and Moscow.&quot; As a malt master, Stewart ensures the quality of single malts produced in individual casks, but because he has also acquired the skills of a master blender he can create new whiskies."], "title": "How do I become \u2026 a whisky malt master", "article": "It&apos;s only 10am when I speak to David Stewart, but after 20 minutes of impassioned chat about whisky I am almost ready to pour myself a wee dram. Stewart is a malt master for William Grant &amp; Sons, owners of Glenfiddich, Grant&apos;s and Balvenie. It&apos;s a prestigious job that sees him using his nose to produce exquisite single malt whiskies and maintain the consistency of the company&apos;s output, as well as blend new creations. He is also one of the public faces of the company, regularly flying overseas to explain how the firm&apos;s whiskies are made with buyers and clients. &quot;I left school in 1962 aged 17 with five O-levels. My parents told me I had to get a job, so I got three interviews: one at a bank, one at an insurance company and one at William Grant,&quot; Stewart says. &quot;I got offered all three but the whisky company sounded more interesting so I joined as a whisky stocks clerk, knowing nothing about whisky or the drinks industry.&quot; Fortuitously, Stewart&apos;s boss was the firm&apos;s master blender. After he had been doing clerical work for two years the master blender started to teach him how to &quot;nose&quot; whisky. This involves easing your nose into a tulip-shaped glass and testing the drink through smell. &quot;He taught me what to look for, what should and shouldn&apos;t be there, the style of our own products, how whisky matures \u2026 Quite quickly I saw that if I could master the nosing aspect I would be one of very few people in the company who could do it. It took me 12 years to master it to the point where I could prepare blends, but it was quite difficult \u2013 I&apos;d never tasted whisky at the age of 19 or 20.&quot; In 1974, when Stewart was 29, his boss left and he was offered the chance to take over on a six-month trial. He has never looked back. His typical day involves a trip to the sample room where he spends at least 90 minutes nosing. He estimates he noses about 30 whisky casks a day, and has nosed more than 400,000 during his 50-year career. &quot;The rest of my time is spent in meetings, sorting emails, desk work, even a bit of PR. We have customers coming into the sample room and I talk to them about whisky. I&apos;ve also travelled overseas to meet clients in markets such as the US, Taiwan, Paris, Singapore and Moscow.&quot; As a malt master, Stewart ensures the quality of single malts produced in individual casks, but because he has also acquired the skills of a master blender he can create new whiskies. He has developed award-winning ranges of single malts and blends, but also introduced the technique of &quot;finishing&quot; single malt in the 1980s. &quot;The Balvenie PortWood, which we launched in 1995, is the one I&apos;m most proud of,&quot; he says. &quot;I took whisky that had been aged for 21 years and put it in casks that had previously held port. It added rich, sweet port wine notes, and raisin and sultana flavours to the whisky.&quot; It has subsequently won more than 50 awards, but it&apos;s not cheap \u2013 &quot;even I have to buy a bottle myself,&quot; Stewart jokes. Malt master and blender jobs do not come up often \u2013 there are only about a dozen malt masters in the country at any one time \u2013 meaning there is no conventional route into the role. Stewart&apos;s own apprentice had a chemistry degree and had been working in the firm&apos;s laboratory for three years before he was handpicked for a blending role. &quot;He then had almost 10 years with me learning the ropes, which is rare in most industries. I think that type of science degree is probably a good way in, but when it comes to nosing you just have to learn over many years.&quot; Apart from having a good nose, Stewart says master blenders need to be creative and patient because you have to wait so long for anything to happen. &quot;You can wait two years to see how something turns out only to find it hasn&apos;t improved the whisky and you have to start all over again with something else.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/nov/01/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2012-11-01T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "sentences": ["Asustek: Nexus 7 Sales approaching 1 million a month &gt;&gt; WSJ Digits blog  Sales of Google&apos;s Nexus 7, made by Taiwan&apos;s Asustek Computer, are closing in on 1m units a month, the Taiwanese maker revealed."], "title": "Boot up: Nexus 7 sales, Eddy Cue profiled, Uber unshrugs and more", "article": "A quick burst of 11 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Letterpress: one week later &gt;&gt; atebits  In less than a week, we&apos;ve blasted past 15 million words played!

The 7-inch tablet has created a big buzz this year with its low starting price of US$199, but both Google and Asustek have been cagey about revealing actual sales figures.  Asustek executives gave the clearest indication yet, following the company&apos;s third-quarter earnings conference on Tuesday.  &quot;At the beginning, it was, for instance, 500K units a month, then maybe 600, 700K. This latest month, it was close to 1 million,&quot; Asustek Chief Financial Officer David Chang told The Wall Street Journal.   So that&apos;s somewhere between 1.5 and 2m units shipped in the first three months. If Google&apos;s revenues suggested only 1m, what does that imply about the amount that it is getting per device - and the cost it has to make up?

You already see initiatives like Zip Car (car sharing company) where a single car is being used by about 15 families. Customers don&apos;t own cars anymore they buy the service a car provides.

Back in September, Apple said an iTunes overhaul would be out in October. Now it&apos;s pushing that back a month.  Here&apos;s spokesman Tom Neumayr&apos;s take: &quot;The new iTunes is taking longer than expected and we wanted to take a little extra time to get it right.

Uber kills surge pricing in NYC for customers, drivers paid 2X rate to meet post-Sandy demand &gt;&gt; TechCrunch  With the subway system down for the count in the wake of mega-storm Sandy, it&apos;s very, very tough to get around New York City today. And this morning, people who opened up their Uber apps to hail a car in Manhattan were met with another obstacle: &quot;Surge pricing&quot; which is when Uber hikes up fare prices during especially busy times. Now, Uber&apos;s surge pricing kicks into effect during especially high-traffic times when many people are looking to hail an Uber cab - times like holidays, and late nights after major sporting events. The idea is that even during times of high demand, if someone really needs a ride and is willing to pay, there will be a car available for them. The high pricing balances out the high demand. And while today in New York there is certainly an imbalance of supply and demand, many people thought that Uber deciding to turn on &quot;surge pricing&quot; while the city is working to collectively recover from the storm was distasteful. And they let Uber know - via Twitter, of course.   Ayn Rand never drove a taxi after a natural disaster in a large city. Theory, meet practice.

The probe, launched 35 years ago, is therefore mankind&apos;s first interstellar vehicle careening into the vast expanse of space between the stars. Needless to say, as one of two deep space probes launched in 1977, Voyager 1 has explored previously unknown regions of the solar system, making groundbreaking discoveries as it went. Now, in a new paper published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, scientists analyzing data streaming from the spacecraft have uncovered a small mystery right at the solar system&apos;s magnetic boundary with the interstellar medium.

Harden who took to the microphone to welcome the fans before the national anthem. Harden whose ears rang from the very loudest roars from the very loud stands. Jeremy Lin started the NBA season as the undisputed face of the franchise. Turns out, it&apos;s even better to be the facial hair of the franchise. Less than a week after he signed, Harden was seamlessly integrated into the club&apos;s promotional videos and posters, front and center with Lin. Even Lin&apos;s well-worn pun is being superseded by Harden-centric wordplay. By &quot;Fear The Beard&quot; and &quot;Beardsanity&quot;, which really doesn&apos;t work, though is capitalist gold all the same. One small apparel vendor on Toyota Center&apos;s main concourse had sold all 36 of its fake beards before halftime, at $10 each (the uncontrollable urge to itch comes free). Expect a run on Abraham Lincoln costumes at party stores throughout the south-east Texas region. The Sixth Man of the Year was traded from last season&apos;s NBA finals runners-up, the Oklahoma City Thunder, a small-market club who decided they could not afford to give him the fat contract he desired. Ownership&apos;s Harden slogan was less catchy: Fear the Luxury Tax. Harden has signed an $80m, five-year contract extension with the Rockets, which is perhaps $20m more than his market value but makes up for what he can&apos;t earn from a sponsorship deal with Gillette. One of the league&apos;s leading cult figures, thanks to his fuzz-shrouded chin, is also set to become one of its best players as a starter. And his arrival should be ideal for Lin, who has a top-tier team-mate who will absorb much of the media and fan attention, easing the strain on and off the court. Harden will act as a tranquilizer for Lin the phenomenon but as an adrenaline shot for Lin the player. You could also make an alternative argument: that Harden&apos;s presence and talent means the unselfish Lin will become deferential rather than dominant, a democrat not a dictator. The Rockets aren&apos;t paying Lin $25m over three years to be Harden&apos;s personal assistant. But against Portland, Lin and his fellow Rockets kept giving the ball to the new boy, standing back and waiting for fireworks when it was obvious in the latter stages that Harden had mislaid his spark. In the home locker-room half an hour after Houston&apos;s loss, Harden emerged from the showers and slalomed past the massed media to his chair, which was turned towards the wall. He sat silently facing his unmarked locker, dried his droplets and put on his clothes while a hushed semi-circle of 25 journalists stared at his back for a couple of minutes. Finally, as slickly as a Bond villain swiveling on his seat, Harden turned towards his inquisitors. Local reporters, Comcast Sports Net, ESPN. The usual. Oh, and Chinese state television. Harden sounded quiet and shy, like a man who wished his beard was a disguise instead of the exact opposite. He spoke for two minutes then made it clear he&apos;d said as much as he wanted. &quot;The shots didn&apos;t fall, there are going to be nights like that when we can&apos;t make shots. We&apos;ll have to bounce back in the next home game [against Denver on Wednesday],&quot; he said. &quot;I had opportunities to make shots and just didn&apos;t. That&apos;s part of basketball. All I can do is get back to the basics, get in the gym, work on it and be better.&quot;     Jeremy Lin.  Photograph: Pat Sullivan/AP    Lin&apos;s switch from the New York Knicks to Houston has not dimmed the wattage of his celebrity in Asia, which was already familiar with the Rockets thanks to the great Yao Ming, the Chinese NBA star of the last decade. Between 15 and 20 Asian journalists were present on Saturday, roughly a third of the total press corps. Three came from Taiwan, the homeland of Lin&apos;s parents, to stalk him for a couple of weeks. Peak Sports, a Chinese sportswear firm with scant international profile, has its name in Mandarin on the most visible piece of courtside real estate, the hoop stands. About a tenth of the 18,140 sell-out crowd were of Asian origin. Though, if the director&apos;s choice of audience shots during timeouts was any guide, about a third of the fans were Asian, a third wore pretend beards and the rest just like to stand up and throw tortured dance moves when they realize they&apos;re on camera.  &quot;The fan support was incredible. They did everything they could to help us,&quot; Lin said. Had they not captured Harden, the Rockets could have rolled with Fear The Board. Toyota Center has a new four-screen video board that is the largest of its kind in north America. Its widest screens are two-thirds the length of the court and suspended imperiously and surreally above the action like a dazzling, deafening multicolored alien mothership that is about to land on the hardwood and shoot everyone with high-definition death rays. Its size is totally excessive in the NBA&apos;s third-smallest arena, where everyone has a good view. But it is fit for the modern-day sports experience, when going to the game and watching the game on television are one and the same. The board aims to confirm to the national audience for next year&apos;s All Star Game in Houston that everything truly is bigger in Texas. It also symbolizes the franchise&apos;s desire to show itself as dynamic, big-time and big-budget: that this derided industrial city can do glamor and celebrity and cinematic spectacle as well as any Hollywood mogul or New York icon. The trouble is that only two-fifths of the principals are stars. While Chandler Parsons and Omar Asik should be decent, beyond Lin and Harden there is mainly youthful potential that will spend a large portion of this campaign suffering growing pains. The Rockets have possibly the best back-court duo in the NBA... and some other players. LinHardenBeardSanity brings the expectation of instant contention, but until they pitched up the Rockets appeared to be sure to finish so far away from the play-offs they&apos;d need a pair of binoculars to read the top of the Western Conference standings. As Lin and Harden go, so will the Rockets. They opened the season with two wins after Harden scored an historic 82 points in his first two games, including a career-high 45 against the Atlanta Hawks. They bossed the early stages on Saturday. However, after ten points in the first quarter, Harden began to miss, and miss often, claiming only another fourteen. It may have been fatigue \u2013 the Rockets played in Atlanta on Friday \u2013 or the effects of a slight ankle injury. Or possibly the distracting glare from the video board. But when Harden shriveled, so did the Rockets. They lost 95-85 in overtime to Portland, the fitfully-brilliant Lin finishing with 13 points and seven assists. Winning is harder than marketing. Still, at least the place once nicknamed Clutch City can now hold on tight to a little hope. And a lot of hype."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/nov/06/universityofyork-yorkstjohnuniversity", "publicationDate": "2012-11-06T15:00:00Z", "tags": ["UK news", "Film", "University of York", "York St John University", "WH Auden", "Dan Jarvis"], "sentences": ["Twenty nine countries will be represented in the festival, including Taiwan, New Caledonia, Croatia and Iran, as well as the UK, France, the USA, Russia and Australia \u2013 but not, for some reason, India, or any countries from Africa."], "title": "Short films from around the world - and Upper Teesdale - head for York", "article": "Fifteen venues across the city of York will be the setting for the Aesthetica Short Film Festival (ASFF) next weekend.

With an 800,000 strong workforce largely based in mainland China, Foxconn is one of the businesses that has profited from the decline of western manufacturing. Now the firm is apparently planning to reverse the labour drain by opening American factories. As labour costs surge in its home market Foxconn has been looking overseas for opportunities, and sources have told Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes that the company is evaluating cities including Detroit and Los Angeles. The news should cheer Barack Obama, who has promised to create 1 million new manufacturing jobs over the next four years. Foxconn will have to adapt its formula, however, because America does not have armies of workers willing to survive on a few hundred dollars a month and live in dormitories as its Chinese staff do. In Foxconn&apos;s huge assembly halls in China, iPhones and iPads are largely put together by human hands, with very little automation. In the US, sources say Foxconn will specialise in flatscreen TV sets, which are easier to assemble with the help of robots. Apple has for some time been planning to make an internet-connected television set, which would essentially combine a TV screen with a computer. If the work is contracted to Foxconn&apos;s rumoured new factories, the iTV would be the first Apple product made in the US for some years. The company declined to comment on its plans, but chairman Terry Gou revealed this week he was planning to invite dozens of American engineers to his factories in China to learn about manufacturing. Gou told a business meeting on Wednesday that he did not believe President Obama could succeed in moving production lines back to the US because Americans have outsourced those jobs for too long. But he hoped Americans could learn how factories are operated so they can return home to set up facilities with automated equipment. Gou said he was already in discussion with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology about establishing an exchange programme. Foxconn will have to adapt its working conditions to operate in the US market. Worker suicides, industrial accidents and riots have dogged its mainland China plants, which were recently discovered to be employing workers as young as 14. The scandals have proved a source of embarrassment for its largest client. Apple chief executive Tim Cook was prompted in January to appoint an external auditor, the Fair Labor Association, to evaluate conditions throughout its supply chain after a string of workers killed themselves and there was a lethal explosion at the company&apos;s Chengdu plant, thought to have been caused by combustible dust. Reforms undertaken as a result of the audits have led to rising costs at Foxconn, which also makes phones for Nokia and tablets for Amazon. The company has cut overtime hours and announced a near doubling of salaries in China in recent months, and is now looking abroad for opportunities. It already has eight factories in Brazil and in September signed a memorandum of co-operation with the S\u00e3o Paolo government to invest $14m building a technological industrial plant. And Foxconn is planning to establish a phone factory in Indonesia by the end of this year, having promised to invest up to $10bn in Indonesia within the next five to 10 years. Gou founded what is now Foxconn in 1974 with $7,500 (\u00a34,624) borrowed from his mother. The company listed in Taipei in 1991, and its largest single plant in Shenzhen, China, employs hundreds of thousands of people. In its own Galaxy Apple&apos;s iPhone 4S has been displaced as the world&apos;s bestselling smartphone by Samsung&apos;s Galaxy handset, in a sign that the Californian group&apos;s march to world domination may have been halted. Samsung shipped 18m Galaxy SIIIs in the third quarter of this year, according to research firm Strategy Analytics, outpacing the iPhone 4S which shifted 16.2m units. &quot;It has become the world&apos;s bestselling smartphone model for the first time,&quot; said analyst Neil Shah. The upset could be temporary, with Apple&apos;s iPhone 5 expected to move into the top slot during the run-up to Christmas, but Apple&apos;s share price continued to fall on Thursday&apos;, hitting $545 (\u00a3341), a drop of more than 22% since its record high of $705.05 on the eve of the iPhone 5 launch in September.

Before I flew to Taiwan to map out the social innovation landscape, I was in San Francisco working for a digital innovation agency. A brief call with Joseph Wong, a mentor and former professor changed all that. Who passes up an opportunity to research a burgeoning field with the capacity to change the world while on a tropical island? Not me \u2013 much to my mother&apos;s chagrin. It&apos;s ironic that despite its speckled history, Taiwan has a thriving third sector. Speckled might be a tame way of describing the authoritarian regime&apos;s Martial Law, which severely limited the autonomy of civil organisations. However, in the early 90s (just a few years after the lifting of Martial Law) Taiwan&apos;s non-profit sector saw the development of commercial approaches and revenue generating arms. That&apos;s another interesting fact our field work and literature review has revealed about Taiwan&apos;s social enterprises: they&apos;re less market-driven and often revenue-generating non-profits. The Taiwanese Ministry of Interior pegs the number of registered non-profits at over 60,000 and near 5,000 for social enterprises. It&apos;s no accident that the seemingly non-existent social enterprise sector has grown so rapidly in a decade. Inspired by a EU program to develop the third sector, the Taiwanese government followed suit and in particular supported non-profits creating jobs for target groups \u2013 transforming many non-profits into social enterprises. Here&apos;s an interesting case study: while visiting Taipei&apos;s famous hot springs, we learnt our spring was a private-partner partnership. The beauty of such an arrangement is that public resources are kept public and protected while still promoting competition and innovation. Instead of a single minister of hot springs dictating how the springs are run, an individual entrepreneur runs it. And unlike government officials, the livelihoods of the entrepreneur depends on the success of the spring. It&apos;s not just Taiwan; public-private partnerships are taking off around the world. KPMG identified huge successes in India, Sweden has opened public-private hospitals, and there&apos;s the Canada Line rapid transit system. And it&apos;s no surprise, private-public companies have been shown to be more profitable than purely public enterprises and have even been attributed to the Taiwan Miracle, its period of rapid industrialisation. During a Taipei entrepreneur meet-up we attended, there was an exchange that was telling of the gulf between the government&apos;s mandates and its actions. The organiser of the event attempted to introduce a special guest from the Taiwanese SMEA (Small and Medium Enterprise Administration). I&apos;ve never seen someone try so hard to refuse an introduction as this mumbling fellow. Finally after some prodding, the government representative discussed some ministry programs available to entrepreneurs, but exclaimed that not enough people are aware of those services. It&apos;s funny that the representative didn&apos;t connect his disinterest in connecting with the community with his ministry&apos;s failure at marketing of their programs. This is in stark contrast with Silicon Valley. Like many, I was drawn to the Valley by its technology sector. This reverse brain-drain sustains the Valley&apos;s dominance, but doesn&apos;t explain how it came to be. The answer is that Silicon Valley wouldn&apos;t exist without co-operation by public and private institutions. Top research institutions like Stanford and CalTech won lucrative military contracts from WW2 to the Cold War that funded high-tech research. And to this day, mayor Ed Lee of San Francisco regularly engages with tech companies as he did with faberNovel, my former employer. For Taiwan to sustain its rapid growth and become a social enterprise hub, it needs to hasten its dialogue with its third-sector to bridge the existing chasm.

Despite the catastrophic Japanese economic collapse in the late 1980s that led to the so-called Lost Decade (which has lasted far longer than 10 years), many of these firms managed to hold on to their position as export powerhouses. And while their country dipped in and out of recession, Japanese carmakers once written off as purveyors of cheap-but-clunky boneshakers (not least when Alan Partridge called the Lexus a &quot;Japanese Volvo&quot;), have moved up the value chain to turn out sleek, desirable vehicles. But it&apos;s many years since Japan&apos;s corporate giants were setting the pace. From Silicon Valley, where Apple designs one whizzy must-have after another, to South Korea, where nimble Samsung is throwing billions of dollars at innovation, Japan&apos;s firms have been outflanked. China is cheaper \u2013 and itself following the same path, from undercutting rivals on cost, to designing its own technology \u2013 while Korea, Taiwan and the US continue to innovate. Japan&apos;s giants are struggling to maintain their dominance. Sharp was forced to warn recently that it has &quot;serious doubts&quot; about its ability to continue as a going concern. President Takashi Okuda said: &quot;We have a lot of great technology which we want to tap to revive and generate profit, but the company does not have that vitality.&quot; Panasonic and Sony have issued grim profit warnings. Official figures to be published tomorrow are likely to show that the Japanese economy as a whole slid into the red in the third quarter of 2012, once the momentum of post-tsunami reconstruction began to subside; and many analysts are expecting a second negative quarter at the end of the year, which would mark (yet another) recession. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicted last week that a declining working-age population and the rise of powers such as China and India mean Japan will contribute just 2% of global GDP in 2060; in 2011, it was 7% . There are plenty of reasons for the woes of the Japanese industrial sector, not least that independent directors are few and far between, and cross-shareholdings \u2013 one company owning a chunky stake in another \u2013 remain common. Briton Michael Woodford discovered the perils of trying to impose western corporate values on a Japanese firm when he exposed a financial scandal at camera-maker Olympus, which he had been brought in to run, but was duly dumped and later excoriated by its chairman for showing &quot;dislike of Japan&quot;. But as John Plender pointed out in the Financial Times last week, there&apos;s another explanation for the country&apos;s flagging performance: its economy has been wrenched out of shape by many years of rock-bottom borrowing costs. Quantitative easing, the drastic policy of pumping electronically-created money into the economy, was part of the Bank of Japan&apos;s armoury long before it was unleashed in the UK in the teeth of the credit crisis. Driving down the cost of borrowing to bolster demand and staunch the flow of bankruptcies and job losses is the textbook response of a central bank facing an economy in crisis. Once growth returns, the argument goes, debt levels can be brought down and necessary restructuring take place at a less painful pace. But over time, as cut-price loans become the norm, the corporate sector can become crystallised in its existing shape, too insulated from the cold winds of competition and progress that might have swept many firms away, or forced them to adapt to a different world, in a process the economist Joseph Schumpeter described as &quot;creative destruction&quot;. By delaying the reckoning, and keeping &quot;zombie companies&quot; alive, there is a risk that when it eventually comes, the correction is even more dramatic. Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King is well aware of this dilemma: keeping the economy afloat in the short term (or in the UK&apos;s case, preventing a deep recession becoming an even deeper one) may delay a much-needed economic adjustment in the long term. But the problem is that, as MPC members can&apos;t fail to notice if they&apos;ve a moment to glance at the portents from Japan, if the return to &quot;normal&quot; never comes, a short-term sticking plaster can become a long-term crutch. That will no doubt have been just one of their concerns last week when they opted not to increase QE. The comparison with Japan&apos;s case is not exact: here, it&apos;s the banks and heavily indebted households that are being kept alive by cheap debt, rather than our exporters, many of which have healthier balance sheets. But in a recent speech King gave just one alarming example of how low interest rates may be distorting the world. No one yet knows whether rocketing house prices in the late 1990s and early 2000s reflected a sensible adjustment to a fall in long-term borrowing costs or a drastic misjudgment on the part of Britain&apos;s householders about their future earnings potential. &quot;Since long-term interest rates in financial markets are, if anything, even lower today, the question of sustainability has not yet been resolved,&quot; he warned. Housing may still be overvalued; but we can&apos;t tell, because cut-price mortgages have (rightly) helped to avoid the wave of repossessions that might have followed if the Bank had been less aggressive in cutting rates, and keeping them there.

As the elites sit inside the Great Hall of the People (that excludes the &quot;people&quot;), Beijing&apos;s taxi drivers have been ordered by state security to remove their window handles; knife shops are told to close business during the event; no one should buy anything that can fly, including balloons; and pop songs containing words like &quot;death&quot; or &quot;step down&quot; have been censored. But what marks out the 18th congress as different from any of its predecessors is the growing demand for change from below. During the 14th congress of 1992, the first after the Tiananmen Square massacre, there was no such idea as &quot;citizen&quot; as the atmosphere of repression had silenced society. Even during the 17th congress in 2007, there was relative social calm and little enthusiasm for political debate among the population. But discontent has grown steadily, mainly as a result of the economic slowdown. Many working-class people are bearing the brunt of the global slump and, in the third decade of the economic reform and opening-up era (gaige kaifang), are experiencing the greatest insecurity in their life. They face unemployment, job insecurity and the burden of privatisation of public services \u2013 and they are not keeping silent any more. There has been a sharp increase of &quot;mass incidents&quot; (the government&apos;s term for all forms of civil disobedience) across the country: the number reached 80,000 in 2008 and then increased to 100,000 within two years. And more than ever, China&apos;s citizens are speaking out through the growingly active social media. The hidden voters \u2013 the internet users \u2013 are demonstrating their frustration and anger at the absence of democracy. They have already labelled the congress Sparta \u2013 a code word designed to get around the country&apos;s internet censors. All over Sina Weibo and Qzone \u2013 the latter the world&apos;s largest social networking site, with 9.5m new blog entries registered every day \u2013 citizens&apos; anger is boiling up. As the world watches China&apos;s leaders change hands, Chinese citizens say they feel excluded and ridiculed. Bloggers demonstrate a total lack of confidence in the government&apos;s ability to address corruption, which is particularly rampant at a local level. &quot;Our political system excludes civil participation \u2026 The central leadership lacks legitimacy \u2026 The market economy has exacerbated the serious problems of corruption and misconduct in the state bureaucracy,&quot; said Shen Zewei. Another questions the excessive wealth of the political class \u2013 demonstrated by the Bo Xilai scandal as well as revelations of Wen Jiabao&apos;s \u00a31.68bn fortune \u2013 comparing it with their Taiwanese counterparts: &quot;Why is it that their officials [in Taiwan] have lunch in canteens and eat bentos [cheap lunchboxes] on benches when our feast-loving politicians do expensive banquets and keep their family wealth as a state secret?&quot; &quot;The need for democracy \u2026 cannot be stopped; they cannot block us,&quot; said blogger Leiwusheng. &quot;During the 16th congress [in 2002], there were only 50 million internet users; during the 17th congress, there were 200 million of us; today, there are over 530 million of us. That is, one in three Chinese is an internet user. Do they really think they can block us and stop us from telling them what they don&apos;t want to hear?!&quot; More so than ever, migrant workers too are speaking out. A few days ago, Miao Cuihua posted a protest video online demanding the payment of overdue wages to construction migrant workers in her workplace in Tianjin. She claimed to be a spokesperson for the nongmin-gong (rural migrant workers). Their case of non-payment of wages is one of tens of thousands across the country. The video attracted over 1 million viewers within two days. Messages of solidarity from other workers poured in. This has stunned the national media, who have followed the official line in reporting the &quot;Sparta&quot; and written about the &quot;model workers&quot; who were sent to the congress to praise the Communist party. China&apos;s social media population \u2013 largely young, working age, and many living away from home \u2013 are the world&apos;s most active. They spend, on average, 46 minutes each day on social media sites, higher than their US counterparts (37 minutes). They are well informed and politically aware. More and more, it appears they have created a cyber civil society capable of effecting change. We saw the wave of protests known as the jasmine revolution, inspired by the Arab Spring, organised online in 2011. The same year, a dozen online supporters of the Wukan villagers&apos; uprising (against land grab) organised protests in Guangzhou. Bloggers&apos; sites might get censored and closed down, but they are set up again elsewhere, under new names. It is a guerrilla war of the working class. All this development points to a clear future direction: the ruling elite can no longer expect the working class to be docile and trade off their political rights for &quot;economic freedom&quot;. When people are encouraged to consume and help the economy grow, they want to have a say in how their workplaces and the country is run too. Their anger will continue to be channelled into calls and action for change. Soon enough, those at Sparta will have to loosen their grip in order to survive."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/nov/13/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2012-11-13T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google", "Samsung"], "sentences": ["Government welcomes HTC-Apple patent settlement &gt;&gt; CNA ENGLISH NEWS  The settlement will have a positive effect on Taiwan&apos;s exports as a major part of its ICT shipments are from HTC, said Chen Ming-shih, a spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs&apos; Bureau of Foreign Trade.", "The Taiwanese smartphone vendor&apos;s efforts to sell products in the United States and Europe had been adversely affected by the patent disputes and the European debt crisis, Chen added.", "ICT showed the sharpest decline of Taiwan&apos;s exports in October, falling by 36.1% to US$1.2bn."], "title": "Boot up: Apple v Samsung, McAfee's final reel?, Microsoft's 7in tablet and more", "article": "A quick burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team FSA examines whistleblower&apos;s claims of &apos;Libor-like&apos; manipulation in gas prices &gt;&gt; The Guardian  The City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, is investigating claims by a whistleblower that Britain&apos;s \u00a3300bn wholesale gas market has been &quot;regularly&quot; manipulated by some of the big power companies, exploiting weaknesses that echo the recent Libor scandal.

Where are the 7in Microsoft tablets? &gt;&gt; Hal&apos;s (Im)Perfect Vision Hal Berenson:   A few days ago I was contemplating a blog post with my speculation about a 7in Microsoft tablet when rumors of an &quot;Xbox Surface&quot; re-surfaced. I tend to believe this rumor because I&apos;ve been expecting that a portable Xbox family member would appear, something I discussed back in a March 2011 blog posting. Seems like I speculated on the wrong specific solution but may have gotten it right on the strategic side.  Anyway, the reason I was thinking about this topic was Windows marketing chief Tami Reller&apos;s comment that there were no 7in Windows tablets on the way. Given that this area is exploding, and has now been legitimized by Apple, I was wondering how Microsoft could ignore such a high-volume market segment.   He doesn&apos;t think they&apos;ll ignore it.

This is partly because of the way the means-plus-function claim rules have been interpreted by the Federal Circuit. Patentees have been able to write broad functional claims without being subject to the limitations of section 112(f).  But it&apos;s also because of the nature of computer programming.  Functional claiming of software inventions is arguably responsible for most of the well-recognized problems with software patents today. Software patentees have increasingly been claiming to own the function of their program itself - not merely the particular way they achieved that goal.   His argument would be really powerful if he were to cite an example, but he doesn&apos;t. (Thanks @hotsoup for the link.)

The first is the tale of a wealthy man, a Tolkien fan from the US, who asked the makers of the movies&apos; One Ring to come up with a costly gold replica, then hired a helicopter to fly him over Mount Doom, where he threw it into the flaming inferno. At least, that&apos;s how they tell it in Wellington. In Nelson, it&apos;s a woman, a spurned lover, who threw her One Ring wedding band into the mouth of the volcano. Then there&apos;s the story of the six-foot-three German tourist who arrived at Hobbiton dressed as, well, a very tall hobbit, who felt so at home in one of the hobbit holes there that he squashed himself into it and refused to leave for 12 hours. In Auckland, they&apos;ll tell you he was Belgian. The Lord of the Rings has been big business in New Zealand ever since Wellington-born director Peter Jackson decided to film his trilogy here, back in the late 1990s. Now, with the imminent release of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey \u2013 the first instalment in the new movie trilogy spun from the far shorter book \u2013 there&apos;s another opportunity to attract Tolkien devotees. People involved with Middle Earth-related tours talk wearily of copyright back-and-forths with the Tolkien estate and with New Line Cinema; it was, initially, hard for them to market anything local as an official Lord of the Rings experience. There&apos;s very much a sense that the tourism which followed the films&apos; release took all parties by surprise, and they&apos;re preparing for it properly this time. The biggest name in the game right now is Hobbiton, a sheep farm that doubled as the Shire for both trilogies. It&apos;s about two hours&apos; drive from Auckland, near Matamata; stop in any of the creaking cafes in the small towns along the way (&quot;Collect your Hot Mail here!&quot; reads the proud sign on one) and you&apos;ll bump into a minibus full of pilgrims on the same journey. If you&apos;re very lucky, one of the lesser-spotted costumed devotees may make an appearance, though on a brisk early spring day, you need more than just a cloak to keep you warm, so we didn&apos;t spy any Gandalfs.     newzealandmap    Jackson&apos;s location scouts saw potential in Alexander Farm&apos;s rolling green hills, lake, and, crucially, large pines \u2013 one of which would eventually become Bilbo&apos;s party tree. After filming was completed in 2004, the set was dismantled, before anyone realised that a massive opportunity had been missed. When it was rebuilt for The Hobbit, the farm fought to keep its hobbit holes. The artwork on the sides of the mini-buses that take people down to the main site still bear the scars of its cobbled-together past. The post-LOTR hobbit holes resembled a Changing Rooms project gone bad, with plain MDF facades fronting holes to nowhere, and though those early visitors may have been disappointed, they did get the option of feeding lambs at the end of the tour, a tradition that still stands today. Sure, you could survey a bit of grass where Elijah Wood once placed his hairy prosthetic feet, but in its original incarnation, these moments required Tolkien-esque powers of imagination. These days it&apos;s far slicker operation, though there is a peculiar feeling to flying for 26 hours only to find yourself in a place that has been chosen for its resemblance to the Malvern Hills. Then there&apos;s the fact that the 37 hobbit holes vary greatly in size to accommodate the different heights of the actors playing hobbits and dwarves at any one time. Oh, and that oak tree that sits majestically above Bag End? Its plastic leaves, imported from Taiwan, blow off in the wind, and have to be replaced every year or so because visitors keep pinching them as souvenirs. So while it may feel like you&apos;re taking a gentle stroll around a lusciously green film set, it can be quietly disorientating. Avoid going the day after you land, lest any remaining jetlag tip you over the edge. Perhaps that&apos;s what happened to the giant German/Belgian hobbit who claimed he had found his home here.     View of Hobbiton Village    Hobbiton may be the main event for now, but Wellington, on the southern tip of the North Island, is about to take over, renaming itself &quot;The Middle of Middle Earth&quot; at the end of November in time for the world premiere of The Hobbit. Back in September, there was little sign of the mania to come, though it already drew on its LOTR history. We spent an afternoon on a Lord of the Rings Movie Tours minibus, along with a couple of hardcore Tolkien fans, who made Hobbiton&apos;s gentle visitors look like pathetic amateurs. It&apos;s a winding drive \u2013 as are most of them in the terminally bendy-roaded New Zealand \u2013 up to Mount Victoria, which is less of a mountain and more of a hill, but which hosted a number of the scenes set in the Hobbiton woods in The Fellowship of the Ring: its paths are marked by cute &quot;hobbit-height&quot; posts. Our Movie Tours guide, Alice, had brought along a laptop, so we could view clips while standing on the very spot in which they were filmed. She also had props. I proudly reenacted a Sam and Frodo breakfast, a deleted scene restored to the extended edition of The Fellowship of the Ring (again, this is not for amateurs), complete with pipe and replica frying pan. Next, we came to the hill down which the hobbits roll when they&apos;re on the run from Farmer Maggot. &quot;Do you want to make a hobbit pile?&quot; asked Alice. &quot;Go on then,&quot; we shrugged, preparing to throw ourselves on the floor. I looked over at the other couple on the tour with us, who, judging by their furrowed brows and the number of questions they were asking about the minutiae of the trilogy, were taking it rather more seriously than us. They stared back, appalled. We did not make a hobbit pile.     Mount Ngauruhoe, on the North Island, starred in the Mordor scenes.  Photograph: Getty Images    I asked Alice if she&apos;d been a fan of the movies before she took the job. &quot;I wasn&apos;t,&quot; she admitted. &quot;I know everything about them now, though.&quot; This seems to be how it is in New Zealand. Everyone has taken up their Hobbity associations with enthusiasm, from the two mountains that stood in for Mount Doom \u2013 Mount Ngauruhoe and Mount Ruapehu, with additional help from scale models and CGI \u2013 to the small family-owned vineyard in Nelson, on the South Island, which won a licence to stick Middle Earth on the labels of its surprisingly delicious wines. You can hire a helicopter to fly out over more remote locations, or visit the gold and silversmith who made the One Ring for the movies. You can&apos;t drive for more than an hour without somebody pointing out a waterfall that might have had Orlando Bloom underneath it or a restaurant that Sir Ian McKellen liked to have his dinner in. What&apos;s nice about it is that the famous laid-back New Zealand character is in the fabric of everything. It doesn&apos;t feel opportune so much as a country going along with something that happened to come its way.     One of Hobbiton Movie Set and Farm Tours homely Hobbit holes Photograph: Ian Brodie    In fact, what may have been our most authentic Hobbit experience wasn&apos;t marketed as one at all. The Waitomo Caves, on the North Island, offer a series of &quot;adventure options&quot; that range from a leisurely underground stroll to look at glowworms to the Haggas Honking Holes challenge, which earns a maximum eight Rambo Points in the brochure. With hindsight, I would recommend you respect this points system, and not undertake an intensive caving experience thinking that mild claustrophobia and a fatal lack of upper body strength would be minor considerations. The name refers to a hollow cavity deep underground that &quot;honks&quot; back at you when you put your head into it and shout, but it sounds like something straight out of the Shire. And at no point did I feel more like a plucky hobbit than the moment I emerged into the sunlight after two hours of abseiling into underground caverns, crawling through freezing streams on my belly and squashing myself through inhuman gaps in the walls. When Bilbo Baggins and the dwarves journey over the Misty Mountains, they shelter from a storm in a cave that turns out to be a goblin hotspot. As I peeled off my wetsuit and examined the bruises that were just starting to appear on my hands, I realised I would have done well to heed Tolkien&apos;s warning in chapter five: &quot;That, of course, is the dangerous part about caves: you don&apos;t know how far they go back, sometimes, or where a passage behind may lead to, or what is waiting for you inside.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/nov/17/new-axial-age-robert-bellah", "publicationDate": "2012-11-17T09:00:01Z", "tags": ["Religion", "Philosophy", "Christianity", "Buddhism", "World news"], "sentences": ["Madsen highlights the emergence of forms of socially engaged Buddhism in Taiwan."], "title": "Are we living in a new axial age? | Mark Vernon", "article": "Are centuries of technological innovation remoulding us culturally so that the inner lives of future generations will seem as strange and elusive as paleolithic man&apos;s is to us? Are we living in a new axial age? The question is posed in a collection of essays, edited by the American sociologist of religion, Robert Bellah: The Axial Age and Its Consequences. The first axial age, it is said, ran across the middle centuries of the first millennium BC. It marked a transformative time in human experience, broadly accepted now by sociologists of religion, which can be summarised as an inward turn and a discovery of transcendence. So, in this period, the Hebrew prophets declared that God was more concerned with attitudes of heart than with bloody rituals in the temple. Not long after, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle \u2013 that extraordinary procession of master and pupil \u2013 &quot;brought philosophy down from the heavens&quot;: they were gripped by the nature of the human condition. The Buddha probably lived at the same time as Socrates, attempting reform of the religions of India by his attention to human suffering and desire. Confucianism and Taoism were born too, creating between them a rich dialectic of humanist rationalism and spiritual non-rationalism in China. &quot;To generalise is to be an idiot,&quot; observed William Blake in a presumably self-conscious generalisation. So, duly warned, are ours axial times too? Karl Jaspers noted that in the period around the birth of Jesus of Nazareth blossomed &quot;superstition in manifold guises, doctrines of salvation of the most extraordinary kinds, circles gathered round peripatetic preachers, therapists, poets and prophets, in an endless confusion of vogue, success and oblivion \u2026 &quot; Sound familiar? Further, continued Jaspers, this riotous marketplace of ideas eroded the moral substructure of society: enjoyment was pursued for its own sake and slaves, the poor and the vanquished were left to rot. It took Christianity to replace the chaos with vision and purpose \u2013 Christianity being one way of consolidating and operationalising the Hebrew and Greek insights of the first axial age. But if &quot;an endless confusion of vogue, success and oblivion&quot; marks our times too, then there seems to be no new Christianity to guide our way, observes Richard Madsen in his essay in the new book. Is there a contemporary faith that might refresh &quot;the deep matrix from which we sprang&quot;, as Jaspers put it? We need to be careful with the word &quot;faith&quot; here. It is not what the Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor calls &quot;expressive spirituality&quot;, of which there is plenty today, based on the conviction that each one of us must create an authentic and individual source of consolation, dreams and self-realisation. Expressive spirituality actually breeds dislocation and feeds the chaos. Even less is faith about being cognitively persuaded to adopt a creed: the head cannot reach &quot;the deep matrix&quot; and so its convictions, when they lack heart, feel empty. Rather, the faith that can energise and organise people is what Jaspers defines as &quot;the fulfilling and moving element in the depths of man, in which man is linked, above and beyond himself&quot;. It is for such a connection that Barack Obama reaches in his most soaring rhetoric. Madsen notes that the original axial movements emerged on the margins of powerful empires. Only at the edges of societies and institutions might you find the kind of balance between playfulness with inherited traditions, and respect for them too, that can retap the axial energy and transmit it in ways that are once again meaningful. Madsen highlights the emergence of forms of socially engaged Buddhism in Taiwan. In the Christian tradition, Madsen finds inspiration in South Korea and its &quot;vigorous minjung [people&apos;s] Christian theology, which mixes some of the expansionist passion of evangelical Christianity with the concern for social justice of ecumenical Christianity.&quot; In the west, Madsen points to Taiz\u00e9, the Sant&apos;Egidio community and the Sojourners. Practical wisdom and spiritual vitality is sought in these movements. They are flexible, unlike fundamentalist religious movements, because their way of life is orientated not around protecting doctrines but around the struggle to be faithful to the deepest principles of their tradition. They also strive imaginatively to communicate their &quot;findings&quot;. And they engage in critical dialogue with other traditions, a dialogue energised more by the exchange of ideas than the claim to power."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/20/coal-plants-world-resources-institute", "publicationDate": "2012-11-20T05:01:00Z", "tags": ["Coal", "Energy", "Fossil fuels", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Environment", "World news", "China", "Asia Pacific", "India"], "sentences": ["China became a net importer of coal in 2009 but the biggest changes are fast-rising imports by Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which all have large numbers of coal-fired plants but produce virtually no coal of their own."], "title": "More than 1,000 new coal plants planned worldwide, figures show", "article": "More than 1,000 coal-fired power plants are being planned worldwide, new research has revealed. The huge planned expansion comes despite warnings from politicians, scientists and campaigners that the planet&apos;s fast-rising carbon emissions must peak within a few years if runaway climate change is to be avoided and that fossil fuel assets risk becoming worthless if international action on global warming moves forward. Coal plants are the most polluting of all power stations and the World Resources Institute (WRI) identified 1,200 coal plants in planning across 59 countries, with about three-quarters in China and India. The capacity of the new plants add up to 1,400GW to global greenhouse gas emissions, the equivalent of adding another China \u2013 the world&apos;s biggest emitter. India is planning 455 new plants compared to 363 in China, which is seeing a slowdown in its coal investments after a vast building programme in the past decade. &quot;This is definitely not in line with a safe climate scenario \u2013 it would put us on a really dangerous trajectory,&quot; said the WRI&apos;s Ailun Yang, who compiled the report, considered to be the most comprehensive in the public domain. But she said new emissions limits proposed in the US and a voluntary cap on coal use in China could begin to turn the tide. &quot;These policies would give really strong signals about the risks to the future financial performance of coal of climate policies.&quot; Nick Robins, head of the Climate Change Centre at HSBC, said: &quot;If you think about low-carbon energy only in terms of carbon, then things look tough [in terms of not using coal]. But if you take into account all factors, then dealing with coal [ie not using it] looks a little less difficult.&quot; He cited the increasing replacement of coal with shale gas and renewable energy, tightening air pollution regulations, the gradual cleaning of economies like China&apos;s and the increasing scarcity of water, which is needed in large quantities by coal-fired power stations. &quot;We expect financiers and investors increasingly to include these factors into investment decisions for coal to avoid the threat of stranded assets,&quot; Robins said. The WRI report also found that, after a slight dip during the economic troubles of 2008, the global coal trade has rebounded and rose by 13% in 2010. A structural shift has moved the bulk of the international coal trade from the Atlantic, serving Europe and the US, to the Pacific. China became a net importer of coal in 2009 but the biggest changes are fast-rising imports by Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which all have large numbers of coal-fired plants but produce virtually no coal of their own. However, Germany, the UK and France remain in the top 10 importers, and coal use rose 4% in 2011 in Europe as prices fell and plants due to close under clean air rules use up their allotted running hours. Indonesia and Australia are the largest coal exporters, with the latter planning to triple its mine and port capacity to almost 1bn tonnes a year. Many developing countries, such as Guatemala, Cambodia, Morocco, Namibia, Senegal and Sri Lanka, and Uzbekistan, are planning new coal-fired plants even when they produce almost no coal at all. &quot;There is a long way to go to raise awareness that you can meet energy needs from sources other than coal,&quot; said Yang. Most new coal-fired plants will be built by Chinese or Indian companies. But new plants have largely been financed by both commercial banks and development banks. JP Morgan Chase has provided more than $16.5bn (\u00a310.3bn) for new coal plants over the past six years, followed by Citi ($13.8bn). Barclays ($11.5bn) comes in as the fifth biggest coal backer and the Royal Bank of Scotland ($10.9bn) as the seventh.

Tensions over the South China Sea and a separate dispute in the East China Sea overshadowed economic and trade issues at the East Asia Summit in Cambodia. The meeting brought together the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) with the other significant powers in the region, including the US and China, Australia, India and Russia. It was the final leg of the US president&apos;s trip, which has also taken him to Thailand and Burma, where he met veteran democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi as well as President Thein Sein. The long-running row over the South China Sea, which involves China, Taiwan and four Asean members, has become increasingly fraught in the last few years. China claims almost all the sea but other countries say they own parts of it. The waters are rich in energy resources and fisheries and an estimated $5tn (\u00a33tn) of cargo \u2013 half the world&apos;s shipping by weight \u2013 passes through them each year. &quot;President Obama&apos;s message is there needs to be a reduction of the tensions,&quot; the US deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, told reporters in Phnom Penh. &quot;The US believes that any solution has to be consistent with international law, has to preserve the free flow of commerce that is important not just to the countries in this region but to the world. &quot;The US is not a claimant in the South China Sea, but we have significant interest there given its role in the global economy.&quot; Vietnam and the Philippines have sought to deal with the dispute in international forums. But China says only bilateral negotiations are acceptable and has urged Washington not to internationalise the issue. State media commentaries this summer bluntly ordered Washington to &quot;shut up&quot; on the issue. The row is coloured by China&apos;s growing strength and Washington&apos;s foreign policy focus on Asia, which has raised Chinese concerns that the US is seeking to contain it. Cambodia, China&apos;s key ally in the bloc, announced on Sunday that Asean members had agreed to discuss the dispute only in talks with China and not multilateral contexts. But Benigno Aquino, president of the Philippines, publicly rebuked his host by announcing his country had not agreed to such a stance. Asean has requested that China start formal talks on a code of conduct to avoid tensions sparking outright clashes. Washington has been pressing for the early development of such a document. Most analysts see little hope of resolving the complex dispute at present and argue the most important step is to prevent further escalation. Shi Yinhong, an expert on international relations at Renmin University in China, said it was not realistic to expect a code of conduct to be agreed swiftly, but that it was important to reach general agreement on one. He said China was concerned about maintaining good relations with Asean and that the bloc should look carefully at Beijing&apos;s stance on the wider issue, noting: &quot;China&apos;s position is that for the territorial dispute they will only accept negotiations between individual countries. For maritime rights I think it is much more flexible.&quot; Asean is trying to evolve into a more powerful regional grouping to help foster development. But the South China Sea row has threatened to undermine those ambitions. In July, a meeting of Asean foreign ministers failed to agree on a communiqu\u00e9 for the first time in the bloc&apos;s history due to disagreements over the issue. Beijing is also enmeshed in a tense dispute with Tokyo over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, which sparked mass demonstrations in China earlier this year. The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, told Obama in a meeting on the sidelines of the summit: &quot;With the increasing severity of the security environment in East Asia, the importance of the Japan-US alliance is increasing.&quot; Earlier, the US president told outgoing Chinese premier Wen Jiabao that the world&apos;s two largest economies needed to work together to &quot;establish clear rules of the road&quot; for trade and investment. The meeting, held before the summit began, was his first with a Chinese leader since his re-election and follows a campaign in which both he and his Republican rival Mitt Romney criticised China for unfair trade practices."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/nov/23/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2012-11-23T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google", "Lenovo"], "sentences": ["Black Friday to be crucial market test for convertible notebooks, say Taiwan makers &gt;&gt; Digitimes  The Black Friday peak sales period starting from November 23 in the US is seen as a crucial market test for convertible notebooks which combine features of ultrabooks and tablets, according to Taiwan-based supply chain makers."], "title": "Boot up: China's 3G revolution, more RIM losses, predicting crime and more", "article": "A quick burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team The amazing China smart phone market &gt;&gt; LinkedIn Kai Fu Lee:   Broadband wireless is now over 58%, and smart phone prices have dropped to about $100 for an acceptable Android phone, and about $200 for a full-featured Android phone.

In addition to NTSB, which has about 400 workers, far larger organizations earlier shifted away from BlackBerry in recent months:  o In October, the Defense Department requested a software contract to monitor security for mobile devices from Apple and Android, but not BlackBerry. The Defense Information Systems Agency program will initially support 162,500 devices and could ultimately support 8 million devices.  o In September, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which had relied on BlackBerry for eight years, announced it was switching to iPhones for 17,676 users because BlackBerry could &quot;no longer meet the mobile technology needs of the agency.&quot;  o In May, the Transportation Security Administration, which had relied mainly on Microsoft Windows and BlackBerry devices, announced plans to spend $3m on Apple products to support its counter-terrorism mission.

The sources pointed out that the attractiveness of Windows 8 as well as consumers&apos; acceptance of touchscreen features in notebook devices will also become major factors affecting demand for convertible notebooks.   Ultrabooks have so far disappointed. Will convertibles (which have tried and failed once before, about ten years ago) succeed instead? FBI opens criminal probe of Hewlett-Packard deal for British software maker Autonomy &gt;&gt; SiliconValley.com  Sources familiar with the investigation said the Federal Bureau of Investigation&apos;s San Francisco office opened a probe into the $11 billion deal Tuesday at the request of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Metropolitan Police and Predictive Crime Mapping &gt;&gt; James Cleverly AM  Researchers from University College London&apos;s Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science have shown it&apos;s possible to develop even more effective crime hotspot maps by modelling the spread of crime in a way similar to modelling the spread of disease. Their work confirms a &apos;prospective hotspot map&apos; is more effective than traditional crime mapping methods.  The Metropolitan Police need to get more crime fighting output with less financial input so money needs to be targeted at systems that can achieve more for less.   Very intriguing. (Crime mapping was one of the benefits that the Free Our Data campaign pushed - and one that, to his credit, Boris Johnson was quick to introduce after first being elected.) Microsoft &apos;dragging its feet&apos; on Linux Secure Boot fix &gt;&gt; The Register  The Linux Foundation&apos;s promised workaround that will allow Linux to boot on Windows 8 PCs has yet to clear Microsoft&apos;s code certification process, although the exact reason for the hold-up remains unclear.  As The Reg reported previously, the Secure Boot feature of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) found on modern Windows 8 PCs will only allow an OS to boot if its code has been digitally signed with a key obtained from Microsoft.  That&apos;s a problem for many Linux distributions, because some lack the resources to purchase a Microsoft key, while others simply refuse to.   Aren&apos;t Chromebooks good enough and fast enough for this? And they are pretty much running Linux already. &quot;Your criticisms are completely wrong&quot;: Stallman on software patents, 20 years in &gt;&gt; Ars Technica  [Professor John] Duffy [of the University of Virginia] raised the specter that some things might not be invented at all without patents, in software and other fields. &quot;The only thing worse than a patented technology that burdens the public is not having a technology at all,&quot; he said. Sure, some software patents were a pain, but others were protecting important work. &quot;The question is, will you get very serious research that is patent-motivated? Speech recognition, for example, is very patent-intensive.&quot;  In Stallman&apos;s view, the idea that society might be able to eliminate &quot;bad patents&quot; while keeping good ones is a kind of Jedi mind trick. Offering patents as a reward for software development--a system where the prize is a right to shut down someone else--is fatally flawed.  &quot;Consider the MP3 patent,&quot; said Stallman. &quot;That caused a lot of harm. It&apos;s not trivial, it came from a research institute. But we can fund research institutes in other ways.&quot;   (Thanks @doarunner for the link.)

Also, my company supported the iPhone, even though it was terrible for calendar, contacts, email, you know, pretty much everything that mattered to me.  But because I&apos;m no longer day to day at my company, I&apos;ve been eager to move away from the iPhone, for many reasons, including the extraordinarily awful experience I recently had, chronicled here. And I really like the philosophy of Android. It&apos;s open, it&apos;s hackable, it&apos;s generative in all the right ways.  However, it&apos;s also a utterly confusing mess.

The first two are, obviously, size and weight. This is a full Ivy Bridge system. While it&apos;s reasonably thin and light for a laptop, it&apos;s pretty thick and heavy for a tablet. The 13-inch screen also makes it awkward to hold for long periods of time, especially with one hand. It does somewhat better if you&apos;re sitting in a chair, on a train, or in a plane with it resting in your lap, but it&apos;s still not something you&apos;d want to carry around your house.  The other problem is the keyboard--since the screen flips all the way around on its hinge, it leaves the keyboard and trackpad completely exposed. The laptop disables keyboard and trackpad input when not in laptop mode, so accidental input isn&apos;t a problem, but it still makes the computer awkward to hold while in tablet mode. This is all to say nothing of the extra wear you&apos;re exposing the keyboard and wrist rest to by placing it on a flat surface and scooting it around.   The full flip on the hinge is clever, though. (Thanks @hotsoup for the link.) Why competitors should fear the iPad mini &gt;&gt; TechPinions Ben Bajarin:   The vast majority we interviewed had not owned a tablet yet and were on all parts of the economic scale. Those in the lower income brackets were also intending to research a few other tablets in the 7? form factor. The leading three were the Nexus 7, Kindle Fire HD and Nook HD. Even with that bit of feedback over 60% said they were still leaning toward the Mini.  When we discussed the intended use cases for the iPad Mini, every single person with kids mentioned it as a part of their child&apos;s educational process as a key use case. This did not surprise me. What did surprise me was that over half of those who brought up using it as a part of their kids educational process made the point that they believed the iPad would be used in schools in the future and making sure their kids were proficient with it was important and that they wanted their kids to use the same technology at home they will be using in schools.

About $27bn (\u00a317bn) was sent to the world&apos;s 48 least developed countries (LDCs) by nationals working abroad last year and remittances from emigrants continued to rise even during and after the global financial crisis. In its latest LDCs report, the UN conference on trade and development (Unctad) said the countries should create an agency, ideally at ministerial level, to co-ordinate issues around remittances: diasporas and migration; migrants themselves; migrants&apos; families in the home country; the government in the home country; and the government in the host country. Some LDCs already have ministries dedicated to migration, remittances and diasporas such as Bangladesh, which set up one in 2001. Its main function is the creation, promotion and regulation of employment abroad to ensure a steady flow of remittances. Haiti and Senegal have established ministerial positions for dealing exclusively with diaspora issues. In Senegal, the Local Collective Development Projects has provided technical assistance for 221 projects in agriculture, tourism and other sectors. Half of them were undertaken by diaspora members who remained in France, while the others were implemented by investors who returned permanently to oversee their projects. However, most LDCs do not give these issues enough weight within government, and deal with them at lower than ministerial levels, said Unctad. Remittances to developing countries are an important source of funding. Officially recorded remittances to developing countries are expected to reach $406bn this year, according to the World Bank, although the true size, including unrecorded flows, is believed to be significantly larger. The bank says remittance flows to poor countries are three times larger than official development assistance (ODA). One of the key issues is the cost of transfer fees, said Unctad. For LDCs, the average cost of remitting was close to 12% of the amount sent, 30% higher than the international average, with the most expensive channels in Africa. Remittances sent to sub-Saharan Africa in 2010 could have generated an additional $6bn for recipients if remittance costs had matched the global average, according to estimates. Unctad said African governments could reduce costs by opening the market to more remittance companies instead of signing exclusivity arrangements with firms such as MoneyGram and Western Union, which control 65% of all remittance locations in Africa despite the emergence of new players such as Dahabshiil. &quot;We would like to see greater service provision, more partnerships between banks and microfinance, [and] we&apos;d like to see post offices more involved. But in most African countries, the financial sector is small and weak,&quot; said Junior Davis, one of the report&apos;s authors. The explosion in the use of mobile phones in Africa holds some promise in cutting remittance costs but, as of early 2012, only 20% of 130 mobile banking operators such as G-Cash in the Philippines and M-Pesa in Kenya and Tanzania offered international remittance services. Mobile remittances have not taken off, said the World Bank, because they fall in the regulatory void between finance and telecommunications. Many central banks do not allow non-bank companies to conduct mobile transactions or cash money at an agent. Besides sending back money, the diaspora could provide valuable skills as entrepreneurs and trade networks, said Unctad. For example, Oromo refugees from Ethiopia in Britain developed the Oromo Coffee Company, which appealed to a wide market. Ethiopia is also using diaspora bonds, which offer attractive interest rates, to raise money for infrastructure projects, particularly dams. A first step for many LDCs could be to try to tap the potential of its diaspora by exporting goods emblematic of home but hard to find in the host country. Unctad said LDCs should emulate countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and India, which have successfully used diaspora networks to transfer skills and knowledge. India granted generous incentives to diaspora investors who actively promoted and supported the software sector in the late 1990s. At a minimum these networks can partly offset the huge knowledge gap created by the brain drain, when university-educated people leave. These networks could help the state in linking local firms with foreign ones to address specific bottlenecks and shortages. LDCs should adopt a proactive diaspora policy to ensure these essentially private voluntary networks gain the trust and confidence to commit to their countries of origin, the report says. Indian policies, for example, did not focus on the return of diaspora members but highlighted the importance of international networks that linked professionals overseas with those in India, helping to develop India&apos;s information and communications industry. Unctad cautioned, however, that remittances should not be considered a substitute for foreign direct investment, ODA, debt relief or the mobilisation of internal resources. Dr Supachai Panitchpakdi, Unctad&apos;s secretary-general, added: &quot;LDCs will likely be hard hit by the global economic slowdown. This will require rethinking alternative sources of knowledge, entrepreneurship and trade links.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/nov/27/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2012-11-27T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "sentences": ["Shipments of ultrabooks, ultra-like models to double in 2013, say Taiwan makers &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Ultrabooks will account for 10% of global notebook shipments in 2013, and ultra-like ones will make up another 10%, the sources estimated."], "title": "Boot up: Windows Phone's next update, Android's use mystery, ultrabook forecasts and more", "article": "A quick burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Google [doesn&apos;t] acquires US national high-traffic broadband Wi-Fi provider ICOA Inc. for $400M [Update: Nope] &gt;&gt; TechCrunch Note that the following is not true:   Google today announced that it has acquired Rhode Island-based ICOA, Inc. in a deal worth $400 million, as it looks to &quot;further diversify it&apos;s already impressive portfolio of companies.&quot; ICOA provides wireless broadband Internet in high-traffic public areas, which include marinas, restaurants and airports, and offers Wi-Fi hotspot design, installation and maintenance.

Apollo Plus: Microsoft&apos;s next Windows Phone update to include Wi-Fi, audio, and other fixes &gt;&gt; The Verge Tom Warren:   We&apos;re told that Microsoft is preparing to include VPN support in Windows Phone, a missing option since the reset of Microsoft&apos;s mobile OS efforts, that will allow corporate users to connect to work systems -- this feature may make it into the first Apollo Plus update. A Wi-Fi connection fix is also planned to let connections always remain on, alongside some audio improvements. Apollo Plus will also test Microsoft&apos;s ability to deliver Windows Phone 8 updates over-the-air, a change from the previous OS that required users to plug devices into PCs to get similar updates.   &quot;Apollo Plus&quot; will be the update to Windows Phone 8. But read on below.. Windows Phone team: this is no way to treat early adopters &gt;&gt; SuperSite for Windows Paul Thurrott:   Understanding that the Windows Phone team had bought into the same ludicrous wall of secrecy policy that Steven Sinofsky foisted on the Windows team, I didn&apos;t bother asking about Windows Phone 7.8 at all between the June announcement and the late October release of Windows Phone 8. I simply assumed that Microsoft would silently ship the WP 7.8 update, over the air, and to all Windows Phone 7.5 users, on or before the day that WP 8 shipped.  Nope.  So I asked at that time. And--yep, you guessed it--I received the big &quot;no comment.&quot; (At least they responded.)  Today, almost exactly one month after the Windows Phone 8 release and over 5 months after it was announced, Microsoft has never really publicly discussed Windows Phone 7.8 again nor has it hinted at when it might be released.  Microsoft, silence is no way to treat early adopters, the people who are your most loyal customers.  Windows 8&apos;s early uptake trumps Vista&apos;s &gt;&gt; Computerworld  Microsoft&apos;s Windows 8 may be lagging far behind Windows 7 in its usage uptake, but it&apos;s easily topping the low bar set by Windows Vista, according to data from Web metric firm Net Applications.  Windows 8 accounted for 0.45% of all computers running Windows during October, Net Applications noted earlier this month, five times less than Windows 7&apos;s 2.33% for the same month three years ago...  Numbers recently unearthed on Net Applications&apos; website, however, now allow a head-to-head comparison for previous months.  By the end of January 2007 - Vista debuted Jan. 30 of that year - the then-new OS powered just 0.19% of all Windows systems, or less than half that of Windows 8 after its Oct. 26, 2012 release.   &quot;Less bad than Vista&quot; isn&apos;t really a great marketing line. Don&apos;t sue over tweets :: &gt;&gt; Future Of The Internet Jonathan Zittrain on why TV stations should get different treatment from individual Twitter users:   The answer is that television stations can and should have fact checking and legal departments as part of the cost of responsible business. Individuals cannot be held to a similar practice, and a series of uneven threats that stills the speech of only the most lawyer-sensitive will unduly undermine the huge value of a service such as Twitter. There may be call to go after the most egregious malicious actors -- those who intentionally seek to sow untrue and damaging information about a specific person -- but the very identification of 10,000 uncoordinated tweets and retweets suggests something other than bad faith by all. Traditional media can remain vibrant precisely by upholding a higher standard and helping social media to sift truth from falsehood.   What if a tweet reaches more people - because Twitter is a broadcast network - than the original TV programme? The Android engagement paradox &gt;&gt; asymco Horace Dediu digs into the IBM analytics about Black Friday e-commerce access:   This I consider to be a paradox: Why is Android attracting late adopters (or at least late adopter behavior) when the market is still emergent? We&apos;ve become accustomed to thinking that platforms that look similar are used in a similar fashion. But this is clearly not the case. The shopping data is only one proxy but there are others: developers and publishers have been reporting distinct differences in consumption on iOS vs. Android and, although anecdotal, the examples continue to pile up.  And engagement is not a frivolous platform attribute. It is highly causal to success because it correlates with all cash flows associated with ecosystem value creation. Especially when a platform like Android depends more on engagement than &quot;monetizing hardware.&quot;  I&apos;m not satisfied with the explanation that Android users are demographically different because the Android user pool is now so vast and because the most popular devices are not exactly cheap.  Shipments of ultrabooks, ultra-like models to double in 2013, say Taiwan makers &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Ultrabooks will account for 10% of global notebook shipments in 2013, and ultra-like ones will make up another 10%, the sources estimated.

A really great beard &gt;&gt; Wired.com  Two academics at Princeton and the University of California, Berkeley are combing through mountains of data trying to tackle this mystery of the modern world.

Not that this has been an entirely easy time for Stern and the NBA, when is it ever, as the league&apos;s &quot;crackdown&quot; on flopping found its first target, injuries continued to plague some of the sport&apos;s biggest names and the Washington Wizards, well, existed. Still, one year to the day that the owners and players reached a tentative agreement to end the lockout, Stern seems content, or at least just be happy that he&apos;s not Gary Bettman. 1. The NBA found and fined its first flopper One of the more controversial moves that NBA Commissioner David Stern made during the offseason was to announce penalties against players for being bad actors. Now, if Stern were retroactively going after Shaquille O&apos;Neal or Dennis Rodman for their runs of epically bad movies in the 1990s, we could all agree that this would be an unambiguously positive step in the right direction. However, Stern was specifically talking about flopping, when players exaggerate the effects of contact with the hopes of drawing a foul call from officials. The NBA released official guidelines, starting with this 2012-13 season, for how it would punish those who were caught flopping.  Last Wednesday, Brooklyn Nets power forward Reggie Evans became the first NBA player to be fined for flopping under the new rules after drawing a foul on Metta World Peace of the Los Angeles Lakers (because of course MWP had to be involved). The league, which had already warned Evans after similar antics against the Boston Celtics, fined him $5,000 for the alleged act of hard selling. If the league finds him guilty of flopping again this season, Evans will face a harsher fine for each occasion until the sixth violation when he would be looking at a suspension. Now, nobody likes flopping in sports. It cheapens the game by putting more emphasis on cheap theatrics than legitimate competition, and, frankly, the game of basketball does not really need more whistles and foul calls. Instant replay and HD TV have made it easier for fans to catch athletes pulling their best Rodney Dangerfield &quot;oh my arm, it&apos;s broken!&quot; fake-outs, which has led to more and more pressure on the NBA to take action against it. The problem with what the NBA is attempting with these fines, and the threat of suspensions, is that it seems less like the NBA is serious about cracking down on flopping and more that it&apos;s serious about selling the idea to the public that it&apos;s cracking down on flopping. Does anyone think that these fines will make a marked difference in how the game is played on the court, or trust that NBA will somehow be able to easily determine intent through video review? To quote Barry Petchesky of Deadspin:   &quot;These are not the actions of a man who wants to do something about flopping. They are the words of a man who doesn&apos;t want to do anything about it, but would really appreciate if you would take your criticism elsewhere over what&apos;s going on in his league&quot;.  Despite the fact that he was the ostensible victim of Evans&apos;s flop, Metta World Peace&apos;s reaction to the fine was surprisingly nuanced:   &quot;They should just let the refs ref. They keep changing the rules. The refs are doing the best job they can. If you keep changing the rules they&apos;re going to miss calls. And then we blame the refs for that. For these missed calls. If they stopped changing the rules, the refs would&apos;ve been adjusted to this. They&apos;re just trying to do their job. Back in the days, that was never a foul.&quot;  Now, as a not entirely clean defender, MWP has his own biases here as far as what the referees should or shouldn&apos;t allow, but he does raise a good question: Could a more sensible solution to the flopping problem actually involve fewer penalties rather than more? In any case, the problem with flopping is not one that is going to be solved by fines and making examples of a handful of more obvious players. 2. Rajon Rondo is aiming for an assists record Rajon Rondo is chasing Magic. Having matched John Stockton&apos;s longest double-digit assist streak at 37 straight games on Sunday night against the Orlando Magic, the Boston Celtics point guard is now aiming to extend it to 46 games, the all-time record set by Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson in 1983. The Celtics seem to be doing what they can to help Rondo achieve this impressive accomplishment, but there&apos;s concern about whether this streak could end up hurting his team more than it helps. In theory, assists are signs of unselfish play, players who have a lot of assists sacrifice their own scoring chances by passing to teammates who have better looks. In Boston, however, there are signs that Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo&apos;s quest for the longest double-digit assist streak in NBA history might be the exact opposite of selfless. Rondo has a habit of forgoing easy shots in his dedication to getting assists. (Mike Prada of SBN sent out this heavily retweeted example on Twitter Monday night.) Although he sounds a bit like Darrell Hammond impersonating Chris Matthews, the Boston Globe&apos;s Bob Ryan might be speaking for a lot of Celtics fans when he says that the record chase &quot;can&apos;t end soon enough&quot;. Of course, maybe the team&apos;s all-but-admitted focus on helping Rondo pursue this assist record has a hidden purpose. For the last few years, Rondo has gained a reputation of stepping up in big games, the majority of his career triple-doubles have occurred on national television, while lacking the same motivation in the more humdrum regular season contests. Celtics head coach Doc Rivers could be using this record as a motivational tool, a way to keep Rondo&apos;s head in the game. Whatever the reason, it&apos;s starting to look more and more like the Boston Celtics are the ones giving assists to Rondo and not the other way around. 3. The beginnings of a rivalry are awkward Monday night, nearly a month after being delayed by the arrival of Hurricane Sandy, the Brooklyn Nets finally played their first game against the New York Knicks at the Barclays Center. The Brooklyn Nets, formerly the New Jersey Nets, defeated the Knicks in overtime 96-89, partly thanks to the three-point shooting of Jerry Stackhouse. After the tight contest, both teams left with 9-4 records to put them tied for second in the Eastern Conference behind the Miami Heat. It&apos;s good for the NBA not only to have two teams in New York, but also for those teams to be immediately competitive. Immediately this first New York/Brooklyn game was fascinating just in terms of seeing a rivalry spring up seemingly overnight. The crowd seemed to be around 40% Knicks fans, which made it impossible to tell which team had just scored if you went by crowd noise alone. The Nets fans&apos; sporadic &quot;Broooklyn! Broooooklyn!&quot; chants didn&apos;t help matters because they sounded less like encouraging cheers and more like the traditional &quot;B.S.&quot; chants angry crowds direct at officials making calls against their team. The whole thing felt a tad forced and unnatural, but how could it not? If the rivalry seemed to be happening more in the stands, where Nets and Knicks fans attempted to drown each other out, than on the court, well that&apos;s understandable. After all, what we&apos;re seeing is nothing less than a new rivalry arising from the ashes of an older one. As long as both of these teams are playoff relevant, it&apos;s only going to get more intense from here (although that &quot;Brooklyn&quot; chant really does need to be tweaked). 4. The Minnesota Timberwolves are getting healthier, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Philadelphia 76ers aren&apos;t Before the season began, fans were curious to see how two big moves involving the Los Angeles Lakers would pan out: The decision to acquire two time MVP Steve Nash and the trade for Dwight Howard that sent center Andrew Bynum to the Philadelphia 76ers. Unfortunately, so far injuries have prevented fans from even getting a sense of what Nash and Bynum will bring to their respective teams. Steve Nash is still out indefinitely with a fracture in his leg after making barely a cameo with his new team. He&apos;s only one of the injury problems that the Lakers have been dealing with: Steve Blake has been out with abdominal strain, Pau Gasol has been playing through tendinitis and even Kobe Bryant was a game time decision on Tuesday night with those mysterious &quot;flu like symptoms&quot; that athletes tend to get.  Lakers fans can console themselves by saying that at least Andrew Bynum is no longer their concern. The Philadelphia 76ers&apos; hopes of even glimpsing Andrew Bynum in a real game anytime in the near future took another big hit this week. When we last heard from Bynum, he was admitting that he suffered a setback while bowling, and, almost remarkably, the news has gotten worse for Philadelphia fans. The latest news has Bynum out indefinitely, and not just typical &quot;we don&apos;t know when&quot; indefinitely but indefinitely  indefinitely. 76ers general manager Tony DiLeo had this to say about the center, who is dealing with bone bruises and weakened cartilage in his knees: &quot;We hope he will back. We&apos;re anticipating he will be back at some point&quot;. If that sounds grim, at least Bynum&apos;s doctors aren&apos;t begging him to retire: the same can&apos;t be said about Brandon Roy. The Minnesota Timberwolves guard has degenerative arthritis in his knees but is still determined to end his career on his terms, refusing to give up his already risky comeback attempt. It&apos;s an admirable stance in some respects although many of us would rather remember Roy at his peak. The moral of this story, as always, is to never be drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers. There is good news for the Minnesota Timberwolves on the injury front as forward Kevin Love has returned earlier than expected from injuries he (seriously) suffered while doing knuckle push-ups. Love was expected to help the Timberwolves to make up ground in the Western Conference, but they lost the first three games he started. It&apos;s been a strange start of the season for the Timberwolves, who seemed to have played better earlier in the year when they were without their best players. Maybe Ricky Rubio shouldn&apos;t rush things after all. 5. Other Things We&apos;ve Learned \u2022 The halftime act at Knicks/Nets apparently didn&apos;t go so well. Hip-hop legend, and yes he is a legend despite what you may have heard, Slick Rick was tapped for halftime entertainment, and was resoundingly booed for his spirited attempt to rouse the crowd. Note: by &quot;spirited&quot; I mean he possibly had been imbibing spirits beforehand. Listen for yourself (NSFW). \u2022 This week&apos;s dunk of the week was something of a no-brainer. Here&apos;s Harrison Barnes of the Golden State Warriors dunking over Nikola Pekovic of the Minnesota Timberwolves. It really seems like the entire court shrinks as Barnes takes flight. \u2022 After matching their win total for last year, the Charlotte Bobcats decided to make up for about a week&apos;s worth of &quot;regression to the mean&quot; in a single game Monday night against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder had a 40 point lead over the Bobcats at halftime in what ended up being a 114-69 Thunder victory.  \u2022 It could be worse for the Charlotte Bobcats: They could be the Washington Wizards, the Wile E. Coyote of the basketball world, still seeking their first win of the season after twelve straight losses. We are this close to a snarky &quot;Did the Washington Wizards win last night?&quot; website. \u2022 The Miami Heat continue to do cruel things to the Cleveland Cavaliers. \u2022 Taiwan has rejected a political party named after Houston Rockets guard Jeremy Lin dedicated to free health care for all of Taiwan. The Jeremy Lin Party was a step above the Rasheed Wallace Party, which limited its health care options to medical marijuana. \u2022 Also the Rasheed Wallace Party was less of a political party and more of just a, you know, party. \u2022 Who wants to perplex Mutombo? The almost avant-garde advertisers for Old Spice commissioned an on-line game starring NBA legend Dikembe Mutombo entitled, obviously, &quot;Dikembe Mutombo&apos;s 4 1/2 Weeks to Save the World&quot;. I have absolutely no idea exactly what is going on in the game, which involves Mutombo and his friend Science the Bear (?) putting an end to &quot;Gangnam Style&quot; (??) and thus proving the Mayans wrong (???). I&apos;m linking to it here just so I can have some reassurances that this is a real thing and not some sort of flashback. I mean, you guys see this too, right? Right?

Opposite, teenagers perch on stools outside a snack bar slurping &quot;mango avalanches&quot; and &quot;strawberry blizzards&quot; \u2013 piles of juicy fruit over shaved ice that take the edge off the sultry tropical heat. It&apos;s hard to walk more than a few paces down Yongkang Street, or indeed many parts of Taipei, without succumbing to gastronomic temptation. Taiwan may be a small island, but its eating habits have been shaped by a fascinating history of settlement, colonisation and immigration. Once populated by indigenous tribes, it was settled by immigrants from Fujian in southeastern China from the 15th century, and later by Hakka people from the mainland. Portuguese sailors passed by in the 16th century, and the island was colonised in subsequent centuries by the Dutch, Spanish and Japanese. In 1949, at the end of the Chinese civil war, Chiang Kai-shek and his defeated Nationalist army, along with some 2 million mainlanders \u2013 including some of China&apos;s most accomplished chefs \u2013 fled to Taiwan. These days Taipei is a melting pot of regional Chinese cuisines, with a bias towards the refined cooking of Shanghai and eastern China. Most famously, the international Din Tai Fung chain, originally a\u00a0family business, specialises in what westerners call &quot;Shanghai soup dumplings&quot; and locals &quot;xiaolong&quot;, which it has raised to previously undreamed-of levels of perfection. Pick up one of the twirly dumplings, rupture its side with a chopstick and let the exquisite juices flow on to your spoon before you eat.     Bamboo baskets with dumplings Photograph: Corbis    For more formal Shanghainese dining, Feng Chao-lin&apos;s Small Shanghai Restaurant has a cult following among local gourmets. Here, a banquet might include crucian carp braised with spring onion, belly pork slow-cooked with fermented beancurd or crisp stir-fried shrimps. And the tiny and unassuming Sanfen Suqi, a favourite of local food-writer Chu Chenfan, offers slices of juicy pork neck with a dip of soy sauce, garlic and chilli, a\u00a0mesmerising version of a\u00a0Sichuanese classic, as well as &quot;dry-fried&quot; fish, a delicious mix of golden crispness, tender flesh and peppery fragrance. For Taiwan&apos;s local culinary style, try the Ningxia night market where you can perch at a makeshift table and scoff a bowlful of rice covered in a lazy stew of spiced belly pork, a skewer of grilled mullet roe with garlic and radish, or an oyster omelette. Some restaurants bring market food indoors, like Du Hsiao Yeh in Yongkang Street, where you can eat a bowlful of &quot;slack season&quot; noodles topped with a rich pork sauce, mashed garlic and a prawn. It was the Shin Yeh chain that first brought Taiwanese folk cooking upmarket. Head chef Kun-Yin Cheng says: &quot;We&apos;ve tried to raise its status, using less oil and salt and serving it in a restaurant environment, but keeping the old flavours and the special local ingredients.&quot; Shin Yeh is now an international business, serving delicious renditions of classic Taiwan dishes without the rough edges of the nightmarkets. Try, for example, the marvellous soft wheaten pancakes stuffed with warm vegetables spiked with dried fish, coriander and a sweet peanut relish, or, if you&apos;re feeling adventurous, a\u00a0stew of pig&apos;s kidneys and chicken testicles. In the South Gate market, traders preside over mouthwatering displays of Jinhua-style ham, dried bamboo shoots and mushrooms, all locally produced. The fresh fruit grown on Taiwan is a highlight of any visit. Market stalls are piled with wax apples, mangoes, pineapples and guavas, often served with a powder of preserved plums and salt. And there are growing numbers of organic caf\u00e9s in Taipei, according to food writer Sarah Chen, who met me at one of them, Tanhou, for a breakfast &quot;enzyme energy soup&quot;: glasses piled high with juicy chopped vegetables, dried fruits and seeds, which we ate with a spoon. There&apos;s a Japanese edge to the Taiwan food scene, a legacy of half a century of Japanese colonisation, which ended in 1945. The old city fish market has been transformed into Addiction Aquatic Development, a\u00a0chic, warehouse-style Japanese restaurant and supermarket, with a &quot;stand and swallow&quot; bar for sushi-eaters and a\u00a0grill division outside. If you fancy a teppanyaki blow-out, don&apos;t hesitate to drive out of town to the Shen Yen restaurant in Yilan county, where Chef Chen Chih-yung will dazzle you with his local seafood. Our lunch was an 18-course miracle of fish, eel and crustaceans, seasoned occasionally with his home-made soy sauce, and interspersed with sublime bamboo shoots, shots of iced hibiscus infusion and other treats.

Eben? In a blow to Android, judge says Moto patents can&apos;t get injunctions | Ars Technica  The fact that the bench trial over pricing was held at all wasn&apos;t a good sign for Motorola, and this new ruling is an additional blow against it.  The problem for Motorola is that it can&apos;t show it deserves anything more than monetary damages. An injunction is a powerful remedy, and in order to get it, a company has to prove it&apos;s been harmed in a way that a money award can&apos;t compensate for. But in this case, money is enough, US District Judge James Robart ruled.  &quot;Because Microsoft will pay royalties under any license agreement from the time of infringement within the statute of limitations, this license agreement will constitute Motorola&apos;s remedy for Microsoft&apos;s use of Motorola&apos;s H.264 standard essential patent portfolio to include the Motorola Asserted Patents. Accordingly, Motorola cannot demonstrate that it has been irreparably harmed.&quot;  Robart went further than just dealing with the patents in his case. His order, he specified, applies &quot;for Motorola&apos;s entire H.264 standard essential patent portfolio,&quot; including certain European patents at issue in a German action.   Big loss for Motorola Mobility (MMI), and thus for its owner Google whose whole rationale for buying MMI was to get its patents to fight back with. Without injunctions, the patents make MMI a low-earning rentier. Breaking: John captured? &gt;&gt; Who is McAfee?

Windows 8 Sales: Good, Bad, or Ugly? &gt;&gt; Windows Supersite Paul Thurrott:   I&apos;m surprised no one else has questioned why launch-month license sales of Windows 8 weren&apos;t higher than 40 million units. That figure is double the normal sales rate for Windows--remember, Windows 7 sold about 20 million licenses a month for three years straight--but, looked at another way, it&apos;s only double the normal sales rate of Windows. How is it not more than double? Windows 8 is the least expensive version of Windows that Microsoft has ever sold, and the company is practically giving it away via upgrade programs for Windows 7 PC buyers (with a $15 upgrade) and a web-based upgrader for Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 that costs just $40. Even the retail version of Windows 8 Pro, at $70, is significantly less expensive than the retail version of its closest predecessor, Windows 7 Professional, which cost $200, normally, though during a special promotion for that OS, it was briefly $100. So the cheapest Windows 7 Pro upgrade, back then, was $60 more expensive than the cheapest you can get today. Why haven&apos;t more people upgraded?   The new Microsoft&apos;s biggest rival turns out to be its old self.

FTC should proceed with case against Google &gt;&gt; Huffington Post Jamie Court:   When you stare down a $220 billion corporation, it&apos;s hard not to blink. But if the Federal Trade Commission doesn&apos;t deliver on its ultimatum to Google that it settle its antitrust problems soon for real relief or face prosecution, then consumers will never get the open and unfettered online and mobile access to information they deserve. While the government&apos;s battle with Microsoft in the 1990s was about whether the dominant software company could bundle software and an Internet browser, the antitrust case against Google is about whether one company should have so much control over online information that it can steer us any where it chooses for its own profit.

Walter Grauer, Vice President of Information Technology at UCAN, says the group initially pursued a paperless office because UCAN wanted to &quot;go green.&quot; But they quickly realized they could actually save some money if they were more efficient.  &quot;&apos;Going green&apos; is one thing, but it needs to have an added benefit for costs,&quot; he says. &quot;You need to be saving money as well as paper.&quot;  What they found is that the biggest general wastes in their office were paper timesheets and people clicking &quot;print&quot; at their desktops and then forgetting to pick up what they&apos;d printed from the printer. The answer: Electronic timesheets. And now employees are required to physically stand up and push a button on the printer if they want to print something; they need to click print twice -- once at their desktop, once at the printer itself.  With small changes, Grauer says they reduced their printing output by about 300,000 sheets of paper every month. They print a lot of paper -- 300,000 is about seven percent of their monthly output -- but still, he says: &quot;It saved some cash, definitely.&quot;  How to bypass Instagram&apos;s Twitter barrier &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com  Although not optimal, here are couple of tricks to get around the Instagram blockade.  Portal&apos;s physics engine rebuilt in 25KB -- on a graphing calculator &gt;&gt; Ars Technica  A 20-year-old college student has rebuilt Portal, Valve&apos;s 2007 space-bending game, from the ground up, on -- wait for it -- a graphing calculator. In a display that puts the old calculator versions of Mario and Tetris to shame, Alex Marcolina posted to a gaming forum and reddit on Sunday about his re-engineered version of Portal. It took three years to build and cannot, due to resource constraints on TI-83/84 calculators, execute more than 16 kilobytes of code.   WOW. Rethinking the iPhone lockscreen &gt;&gt; The Tech Block  iOS is boring. It&apos;s unconnected. It isn&apos;t flexible. It&apos;s slow. That&apos;s generally the consensus. And while many look to Jony Ive&apos;s new role as the answer, it doesn&apos;t exactly solve these problems. So I thought I would give it a shot.   The ideas are principally about simplifying quick access to apps or functions from the lock screen. One objection: there&apos;s a reason why it&apos;s a lock screen. More important to iOS&apos;s evolution would be &quot;intentions&quot; like Android&apos;s, and other functions. (Thanks @Martwah for the link.) Microsoft&apos;s #droidrage campaign results in #windowsrage on Twitter &gt;&gt; The Verge  Google removed 27 malware-infected apps from its Play Store last year, a move that prompted Microsoft to start its campaign [ in 2011], but despite an upward trend in Android malware, there&apos;s no evidence to suggest it&apos;s as bad as Microsoft makes out. Google is also making changes to Android 4.2 to include a malware scanner that analyzes &quot;sideloaded&quot; apps for malware threats. With no recent high profile Android malware stories, Microsoft kicked off #droidrage again, seemingly out of the blue, and it has backfired.   And how. (Thanks @martwah for the link.)

It&apos;s always been an OS with a split personality, but from the start we were promised the hardware would make it all seem natural.

Apple estimated to purchase up to US$5 billion FPCBs in 2013, say sources &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Apple is expected to purchase at least US$5 billion worth of flexible PCBs in 2013 with Taiwan-based FPCB makers contributing 30% of total supplies, according to industry sources. Apple&apos;s total FPCB purchases in 2012 will be close to US$4bn, of which Taiwan suppliers will account for 20-25%.  The rollout of iPods, iPads, iPhones, MacBook notebooks and iMac desktops has made Apple the largest buyer of FPCBs globally and also a driving force pushing forward the development of the FPCB industry, the sources noted. Apple&apos;s demand for FPCBs is set to continue expanding in 2013, given Apple&apos;s smartphone shipments are estimated to top 160-180m units in the coming year compared to 97m shipped in 2012, while its tablet shipments are likely to increase to 75-80m units from 40m units during the same period, said the sources.

Stock Android isn&apos;t perfect: these are the things I can&apos;t stand about Jelly Bean &gt;&gt; Android Police Ron Mateo:   Stock Android isn&apos;t perfect either, and that&apos;s what we&apos;re here to talk about today. Jelly Bean has all sorts of confusing user interfaces, weird bugs, things that don&apos;t make any sense, and things that desperately need polishing.

Sprint to offer buy-one-get-one free deal on Galaxy S3, Galaxy S2, and Galaxy Victory this Friday &gt;&gt; Phandroid  Turns out some early signage leaked out, showing a nice BOGO (buy-one-get-one) deal on &quot;select&quot; Sammy devices.

A few &quot;lesser&quot; Galaxies also mad the list like the GS2 and Galaxy Victory. The fun starts this Friday, Dec. 7th and lasts all the way until the 24th, giving Christmas shoppers ample time to squeeze in a few GS3?s before the 25th. The best part?

Sitting at her office desk in a plush advertising agency, Zou asks her iPhone where they should go to eat. When it buzzes seconds later, she lifts it to her ear for her colleague&apos;s reply. The conversation goes back and forth through these snippets of Mandarin before they decide on the bento-box place for lunch. Like millions of others across Asia, Zou is using WeChat, a smartphone app developed in China, to send voice messages, snapshots and emoticons to her friends. Now that its walkietalkie-style messages have become ubiquitous, she said typing feels like hard work. WeChat&apos;s popularity has grown dramatically since its launch in 2011. Tencent, the company that developed the app, announced in September that its users had doubled in six months to 200\u00a0million. The vast majority are in China, though WeChat is being launched across Asia and already has subscribers in the US and UK. Historically, it has proved difficult for Chinese internet firms to expand beyond the country. But WeChat is being tipped as the first Chinese social media application with the potential to go global. As WeChat grows, however, politicians and dissidents are voicing concerns: activists fear that the app&apos;s voice-messaging service enables security officials to monitor users&apos; movements in real time. And when the app was launched in Taiwan in October, legislators said they feared that it posed a threat to national security, through the potential exposure of private communications. WeChat is similar to the popular US-based mobile messaging service WhatsApp, but it does more. An amalgamation of social media tools akin to Twitter, Facebook and Skype, it comes in eight languages including English, Arabic and Russian. &quot;I used WhatsApp before I came back to China [from studying abroad] and found all my friends were using WeChat,&quot; said Zou, who is 25. &quot;Now when I want to contact someone I use WeChat first.&quot; The app&apos;s features include Look Around (known colloquially as the &quot;hook-up&quot; function), which allows users to chat to strangers nearby, while Moments works like Instagram. But \u2013 like similar social media tools \u2013 WeChat can also access users&apos; contact books, text messages and determine location through GPS. In China, some fear this could potentially make targeted users susceptible to surveillance. Hu Jia, a human rights activist jailed for three years on a charge of sedition, suspects that voicemail messages to his friends had been listened to by guobao officials (internal security bureau). &quot;I took a chance and assumed WeChat was relatively safe,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a new product and not developed by China Mobile or China Unicom, [two of China&apos;s main telecoms companies], which have been monitoring my calls and text messages for over 10 years. But the guobao surprised me with their ability to repeat my words or voice messages verbatim, though I&apos;m sure I only sent them to some friends through WeChat.&quot; Tencent, the country&apos;s biggest internet company, declined to comment for this article but told the South China Morning Post in November, it said: &quot;We have taken user data protection seriously in our product development and daily operations, and at the same time, like other international peers, we comply with relevant laws in the countries where we have operations.&quot; Adam Segal, a Council on Foreign Relations cyber-security expert, said that WeChat was not alone in offering potential security loopholes. &quot;Information technology services and software are all fundamentally insecure,&quot; he said. &quot;WeChat shouldn&apos;t be singled out in this instance. Many technologies have some type of vulnerability, and a directed adversary can figure out vulnerabilities to exploit and gather intelligence.&quot; Users worldwide, adds Segal, should remember that though an app may have been created in the US, it is not immune to cyber-attack. &quot;Vulnerability runs deeper than the app, it&apos;s in the device itself,&quot; he says, adding that HTC handsets and iPhones are likely to have been made in China.

HP enjoyed a slight shipment growth in November, while Acer had flat performance; however, Asustek Computer, which achieved strong shipments in October, saw the worst drop among the top-5 vendors in November due to unsatisfactory demand for Windows 8 notebooks, according to Digitimes Research senior analyst Joanne Chien.

Ubuntu Spyware: What to Do? &gt;&gt; Free Software Foundation Richard Stallman:   Proprietary software is associated with malicious treatment of the user: surveillance code, digital handcuffs (DRM or Digital Restrictions Management) to restrict users, and back doors that can do nasty things under remote control. Programs that do any of these things are malware and should be treated as such. Widely used examples include Windows, the iThings, and the Amazon &quot;Kindle&quot; product for virtual book burning, which do all three; Macintosh and the Playstation III which impose DRM; most portable phones, which do spying and have back doors; Adobe Flash Player, which does spying and enforces DRM; and plenty of apps for iThings and Android, which are guilty of one or more of these nasty practices... Ubuntu uses the information about searches to show the user ads to buy various things from Amazon. Amazon commits many wrongs (see http://stallman.org/amazon.html); by promoting Amazon, Canonical contributes to them. However, the ads are not the core of the problem. The main issue is the spying. Canonical says it does not tell Amazon who searched for what. However, it is just as bad for Canonical to collect your personal information as it would have been for Amazon to collect it.

Review: 21.5-inch 2012 iMac takes two steps forward, one step back &gt;&gt; Ars Technica  Here&apos;s our biggest problem with the new iMac: making a laptop thinner and lighter is immediately noticeable. You touch and move a laptop constantly...  In a desktop computer, though, the pursuit of thinness at the cost of features makes less sense. The vast majority of the time, it&apos;s going to be sitting on your desk, and users will be interacting with a separate keyboard and mouse, pausing only occasionally to plug something in or adjust the screen&apos;s angle. Giving up desirable features like user-upgradeable RAM just to make a thinner desktop seems like the wrong move, even if it&apos;s one that only IT people and power users will notice or care about.   It&apos;s also a maintenance, support and repairability issue. All disk drives die. RAM upgrades are desirable. And you don&apos;t see the thinness when you&apos;re using the machine. Making a desktop less repairable is a bad move. Nothing else. (Thanks @rubbernuke for the link.)

Photograph: Andrew H Walker/Getty for DIFF    It would be an exaggeration, says Suraj Sharma with a laugh, to describe what he did in the adaptation of Life of Pi as &quot;acting&quot;, despite the admiration he is swiftly accumulating for his role as Piscine Patel, the boy stranded on a lifeboat for 227 days with a Bengal tiger. The terror of clinging to a homemade raft while perilous waves threaten to swallow you? Easy to feel when you have only just learnt to swim. Pi&apos;s drastic weight loss? Sharma felt it too, eating very little but tuna; in the film you can see his ribs. The dejection and exhaustion, adrift far from home? If you&apos;re tired and ravenous and have been shooting for several hours in a vast tank of cold water in an abandoned airport in Taiwan, that doesn&apos;t require much imagining. &quot;It was all just real,&quot; says Sharma with a smile. &quot;I was just trying to survive, tired, I didn&apos;t know what to do.&quot; In fact, Sharma is wonderful in the film. It&apos;s partly the luxury of seeing an unknown teenage actor in such a big role \u2013 no knowledge about his private life, or the memories of previous parts to distract you \u2013 that makes him so believable as Pi, but mainly because he is so good. It is hard to believe he was just 17 during much of the filming \u2013 he is now 19 \u2013 and that this was his first acting job. &quot;I did one or two plays at school.&quot; A wide smile. &quot;Once I played a tree, so I never thought I would be a good actor.&quot;           We sit on overstuffed furniture in an expensive hotel room.

He seems so unselfconscious, quick to laugh one moment, gentle and thoughtful the next. Questions about religion \u2013 faith is the central theme of Yann Martel&apos;s novel, in which a boy, the son of a zookeeper, and a tiger survive a shipwreck, and Ang Lee&apos;s film version \u2013 are given careful consideration. He says his childhood was &quot;vaguely religious. My mum is, but not orthodox \u2013 it was more the tradition. The fact that Pi went for so many religions [he is born a Hindu, but later adds Christianity and Islam], he wasn&apos;t really looking for the religion part of it, he was looking for the essence. If you take away all the layers, all the stories, you&apos;re left with the need for hope. That&apos;s worth believing in.&quot; It was his younger brother, who has acted in a couple of films, who went along to the casting call seeking an Indian teenager for an unknown film, and convinced Suraj to go with him. He was one of more than 3,000 boys seen. At first he says he didn&apos;t want the role, &quot;because if you don&apos;t expect it, you don&apos;t want it. But by the time I reached the fourth round of auditions, I really, really wanted it. I was going through a bad phase in my own life, I didn&apos;t know what to do next, it was the whole coming-of-age thing and I wanted to get away from it all. I hadn&apos;t really done anything in my life and I thought maybe I can finally do something, accomplish something. I had never even been outside my country.&quot; By then, Sharma knew what the film was, knew Ang Lee was directing \u2013 &quot;I had seen his movies, his movies had been a part of my life&quot; \u2013 and had read the book twice. At the final audition he met Lee, &quot;and I\u00a0was so nervous I forgot my lines. I\u00a0thought, &apos;OK, now I&apos;ve lost it&apos;. [Lee] gave me another chance. He talked to me, directed me. In less than five minutes \u2013 I don&apos;t even know how \u2013 it&apos;s just the way he looks at you and how he talks, it becomes very real.

He does something to you.&quot; The Life of Pi, which was published in 2001, won the Booker prize the following year and became a bestseller, was widely considered to be unfilmable \u2013 Piscine Patel&apos;s months at sea, with only a tiger named Richard Parker (not anthropomorphised, but terrifyingly wild and deadly) for company. Its success would rest on its young lead. It must have been daunting. For much of the film, Sharma had to act alone against a blue screen \u2013 the tiger, and endless ocean, were put in digitally in post-production. He got to see the tigers that were used as models for Richard Parker being trained, &quot;and I would use them as reference but I never got to be on the boat with a tiger&quot;. He sounds disappointed. He nods. &quot;I wanted to, really badly.&quot; Was it difficult to conjure up such convincing panic, when he was having to act opposite what looked like a large blue pillow? &quot;It was, but Ang makes things real. It&apos;s not really about what you&apos;re acting opposite, or what you&apos;re seeing, it&apos;s really about what you&apos;re feeling. That&apos;s what he makes very clear.&quot; Lee coached Sharma in acting; Charlie Croughwell and his son Cameron, both stunt co-ordinators, taught him how to swim. &quot;I could swim from one side of the pool to the other in 10 days \u2013 fast, slowly, a couple of different strokes,&quot; he says. &quot;So now we needed to focus on getting comfortable with the water. One day, we had a break for three days so we went down to this beach and we went out kayaking. Cam was sitting in front and at one point he turned round and said: &apos;Jump off.&apos; I said, &apos;No way.&apos; Cam flips the boat over so now I&apos;m underwater upside down with my legs inside the kayak. I swim out and I try to get above the water and I&apos;m freaking out. I looked down and there was nothing I could see and\u00a0I\u00a0started flailing. I heard Charlie\u00a0say:\u00a0&apos;Just relax.&apos; At one point I came up for a second, took a huge breath, went back down and then I gave up.\u00a0And when I gave up, I\u00a0came to the surface.&quot; He smiles. &quot;That&apos;s how I learned how to swim. It was daunting at first, but now I&apos;m happy I\u00a0learned how to swim because I\u00a0love\u00a0it\u00a0so much.&quot; The weeks that followed sound like some kind of hardcore ascetic training camp, rather than a film shoot. Lee had filled Sharma&apos;s iPod with what he calls &quot;spooky God music&quot; \u2013 chanting and choral music, for instance \u2013 to help him connect with the polytheist Pi&apos;s spirituality. Hours of yoga and meditation helped with this too, though it also taught Sharma how to hold his breath for the long shots he would be doing underwater. Around four hours a day were spent swimming, and he had to lose 20% of his body weight to portray the malnourished castaway. I read that Lee had asked him to try not to speak to anybody \u2013 and the crew kept their distance too \u2013 to help him feel Pi&apos;s isolation. How long did that last? Days? Weeks? &quot;I think about two months,&quot; he says with a laugh. &quot;You might think I&apos;m being slightly melodramatic but I felt like I was going insane. I had not many people to talk to about what was going on, I was so far away from everybody I knew, I was doing things I had never done before. I\u00a0got scared of myself at one point.&quot; Not that he would have changed any\u00a0of it, he insists, but he still seems\u00a0bewildered by the whole experience. &quot;Everything is so surreal and dreamlike,&quot; he says. &quot;I was a\u00a0normal kid. I\u00a0can&apos;t explain how normal I was. I\u00a0just got very lucky.&quot; Sharma will soon go back to Delhi, back to university where he is studying philosophy. He says he isn&apos;t even sure if he wants to continue acting. &quot;I like telling stories, I like movies, and I want to work on films. I think I would feel safer behind the camera. I like that idea.&quot; His family keep him grounded, he says, and Lee continues to be a mentor. &quot;He really inspired me. I come from this small, modest family and I looked up at these people [the film-makers] and thought: these guys probably have big attitudes. Then you meet Ang, and he&apos;s so nice and simple and down to earth. You realise money and fame and all that stuff happens, but it doesn&apos;t have to change who you are. I don&apos;t want to be \u2013 can I use bad words? \u2013 I don&apos;t want to be a dick. I&apos;m very lucky I got to start off like this, with these kinds of people. If it had been another movie, with other people, I would have been affected very differently probably.&quot; With the film&apos;s release \u2013 and already talk of Oscar nominations \u2013 and Sharma&apos;s fame growing, he is wary of how life could change. Do the other people at college already treat him differently? He nods. &quot;They&apos;ve started to. The ones I have made friends with always started off with, &apos;I&apos;m not going to treat this dude any differently, I&apos;m probably going to treat him worse&apos;. I like that. Too much attention, stuff like that, is not good.&quot; He gives a small smile, a teenage boy who has gone on his own transformational voyage. &quot;Things have changed, I guess.&quot; Life of Pi is released on 20 December"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/dec/11/english-schools-slip-science-rankings", "publicationDate": "2012-12-11T19:25:19Z", "tags": ["Secondary schools", "Schools", "Education", "Science", "Science", "English and creative writing", "Languages", "School tables", "Education policy", "Politics"], "sentences": ["The government will be alarmed at English pupils being outstripped not just by students in the traditional east Asian educational powerhouses of Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, but also those in emerging economies such as Russia and \u2013 for the younger pupils only \u2013 the Czech Republic and Hungary."], "title": "Decade of science progress in English schools reversed, global study finds", "article": "More than a decade of improvements in science education in English schools have been eroded over the past four years, according to a vast study of attainment in dozens of countries around the world. While English pupils have slipped down the four-yearly global rankings for science knowledge put together by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), they have improved in reading and held their position in maths, the new trio of studies showed. The results were immediately seized upon by the government as justification for its breakneck programme of changes to schools, notably the expansion of academies. Labour, meanwhile, claimed credit for creating what it called some of the best schools in Europe, while teaching unions cautioned against reading too much of anything into yet another set of complex educational league tables. Most scrutiny will be focused on the science element of the IEA&apos;s Trends in International Maths and Science Study (Timss), covering more than 600,000 students who were tested in groups at the ages of 10 and 14. Both sets of English pupils tested in 2011 lost places in the rankings against the previous results. In 2007, the 10-year-olds ranked seventh out of 36 countries; now they are 15th out of 50. Their older peers slid to ninth of 42 nations from fifth in 45. What will be more concerning is that the absolute rating for attainment for both age groups \u2013 an IEA-designed coefficient from one to 1,000, with 500 as the average \u2013 saw increases from 2003 and 2007 reversed, with both scores returning to more or less the same level as in the first study, in 1995. The government will be alarmed at English pupils being outstripped not just by students in the traditional east Asian educational powerhouses of Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, but also those in emerging economies such as Russia and \u2013 for the younger pupils only \u2013 the Czech Republic and Hungary. In a speech at the London base of Microsoft, the junior education minister, Elizabeth Truss, said the science scores represented &quot;not just a relative decline, but an absolute fall in performance&quot;. This had happened, she said, following the abolition by the last Labour government of the externally marked standard assessment tests (SATs) in science for primary pupils, but she said there were no plans to bring this back.Truss noted the relative lack of science teaching for the secondary pupils, with English 14-year-olds spending 102 hours per year on the discipline, below the 158-hour average and less than Iranian or Palestinian pupils. That said, the study shows little direct link between teaching hours and attainment, with Macedonian 14-year-olds coming near the bottom of the achievement table despite a 334 hours per year of tuition. The IEA&apos;s studies, much like similar intermittent league tables compiled by the OECD, generally contain so much data as to support a series of different, even contradictory, arguments. As well as the science rankings, the IEA released new tables for reading and maths, both of which provided better news for English schools. The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (Pirls), which gauges the language skills of 325,000 students aged about 10, ranked England 11th out of 45 nations, notably better than the 15th from 40 seen in the previous study, in 2006. In maths, both age groups in English schools held steady in terms of absolute scores against the last sample, although their league places moved slightly. The younger pupils came ninth out of 50 nations and territories against seven from 36 before, with the 14-year-olds 10th out of 42 compared with seventh from 45 in 2007. Truss is among a group of right-leaning Tory MPs who argue the UK should more closely mirror the hard-edged economic and educational policies of some east Asian countries, even while those nations debate whether their fact-heavy, exam-based systems can stifle creativity. Truss failed to mention the government&apos;s model for its ambitious free schools programme. While Sweden saw a marginal improvement in science, its maths scores have flatlined and it is one of only four countries whose reading standards have declined over the past decade, something pointed out by Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary. He said Labour&apos;s schools policies should take credit for English schools being &quot;some of the best in Europe&quot;. This was, curiously, one area where the two major parties agreed. A spokesman for education secretary, Michael Gove, said: &quot;Labour deserves the praise for the small improvement in reading and the blame for the stagnation in maths and the decline in science. The tests say nothing, good or bad, about what we have done.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 14 December 2012.

Why Google Maps is better than Apple Maps &gt;&gt; The Atlantic Alexis Madrigal:   Nokia had been making quarterly updates, but Nokia&apos;s Fox told me they&apos;d be at weekly intervals by the end of the year. Apple may be in a tougher position because they don&apos;t own all their own data; we don&apos;t know what the feedback process is for improving their maps. My guess is that it can&apos;t be better than Google&apos;s, which is approaching the real-time dream, according to Google&apos;s Manik Gupta, the senior product manager for Maps. That means that not only are Apple&apos;s maps worse, but they&apos;re probably not even improving at a faster clip.  The takeaway here is odd. It&apos;s not about Big Data but Big Labor. Apple employs roughly 25,000 people in the core business (outside retail), so it might be unthinkable to hire a few thousand people (more than 10 percent of the current company) to make its maps competitive. But so far, that&apos;s the only proven way to build a great digital mapping system. Deal with that. Or deal with Google.

Dan Cobley, the managing director for the UK, put the apology on his Google+ page following widespread criticism in user forums of erratic and perverse delivery schedules, in which people who ordered the phones online from Google earlier saw shipping dates long after those who made subsequent orders. The Nexus 4, made by LG to Google&apos;s specifications, runs a &quot;pure Google&quot; version of Android without any handset maker&apos;s alterations. The comparatively low UK price of \u00a3239 for the 8GB model of the high-specification handset - which offers a 4.7in, 320ppi screen, 8 megapixel camera, HSPA+ connectivity and NFC - attracted a significant number of buyers seeking to use it for a sim-only contract with a carrier. But Google hit a series of supply chain problems because demand ran ahead of supply. Google has repeatedly declined to say how many were ordered worldwide, but has been overwhelmed with demand each time it has offered stock through its site, beginning in November. Cobley said in a comment on one of his own posts told would-be buyers and those who had ordered that &quot;I know what you are going through is unacceptable and we are all working through the nights and weekends to resolve the issue&quot;. He offered an &quot;unreserved apology for our service and communication failures in this process&quot;, adding that he realised that &quot;the people who ordered the Nexus 4 so early are among our most committed and loyal users&quot;. People who ordered the phones earlier in the month complained that after being told it would be shipped in &quot;3-5 days&quot;, that they then received no further notification from the company, and saw other people who had ordered later receiving shipping notifications. The problems have caused il feeling with a number of buyers. &quot;I don&apos;t mind (well, I&apos;m a bit miffed) that my phone is late,&quot; wrote one would-be owner, Ben Stewart, on Cobley&apos;s page. &quot;I do mind that first in, first out isn&apos;t being obeyed.&quot; That, together with the lack of communication, &quot;are what&apos;s really annoying&quot;, he said. The hassles over delivery and shipping have left a number of purchasers dissatisfied over Google&apos;s handling of the provision of phones. The Nexus 4, made by LG, is the fourth &quot;pure Google&quot; Android phone, following the Nexus One made bt HTC, and the Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus made by Samsung. Google has also struggled with customers complaining that when they have wanted to return Samsung-made Nexus 10 tablets because of problems, but have run into problems getting shipping labels. Although the Nexus line of phones has been high-profile online, actual sales figures have been comparatively low, with figures released by Samsung during its patent trial with Apple in California over the summer showing that the Nexus S sold around 500,000 units in the year from the second quarter of 2011, when it went on sale there, compared to Samsung&apos;s total phones sales of around 14.5m in the US for the same period. The Nexus 4 has attracted widespread attention because of the low price at which Google is offering it - equivalent to that for a lower-spec smartphone, rather than the Nokia Lumia, Samsung Galaxy S 3 or iPhone 5 with which it might be compared. One irked commenter at product-reviews remarked: &quot;Google needs to just buy a company that knows how to manage this process of selling physical items on line and shipping them. What they have now is a joke, If you call their device support, the people are clueless. Their ability to provide tech support for my Nexus 7 [tablet], or order status for my Nexus 4 is nil.&quot; Google owns the loss-making mobile phone manufacturer Motorola Mobility (MMI). But MMI is in the midst of a retreat from a number of manufacturing and sales positions outside the US, selling off factories in China, India and Brazil and closing offices in South Korea and Taiwan. It is also not set up to deal directly with customer sales, because it is structured as a phone manufacturer which deals with carriers, rather than selling direct.  The text of Cobley&apos;s apology reads:   Dear all I know that what you are going through is unacceptable and we are all working through the nights and weekends to resolve this issue. Supplies from the manufacturer are scarce and erratic, and our communication has been flawed. I can offer an unreserved apology for our service and communication failures in this process. For those that originally received a 3-5 days shipping estimate, your orders are now in process for fulfillment. You can expect an email notification early this week which will include tracking information. Although you will be initially charged in full, you will receive a credit for the shipping charge soon after. For others that received pre-Christmas shipping estimates, we anticipate processing your orders for fulfillment this week. I realise that the people who ordered the Nexus 4 so early are among our most committed and loyal users and we are doing all we can to put things right. Sorry again.

Rising Chinese military power, a historic multilateral dispute involving at least six sovereign nations, potentially vast oil and gas reserves, and the busiest shipping lanes in the world are all combining to form one large low-pressure centre. So the election of a Japanese prime minister on a ticket of getting tough in the territorial dispute might appear to be a further cause for concern. China&apos;s Xinhua agency lost no time in seeking to extract gain from Japan&apos;s lurch to the right. It reminded its neighbour of its second world war record and its ability to upset the status quo once more. This is grossly unfair to a modern-day Japan that, under left or rightwing control, has eschewed militarism to the point of exasperating its western allies. But this is not to say that Tokyo is immune from populist lures. If the Liberal Democratic party went ahead with a pledge to build on a group of islands it knows as the Senkakus but which China calls the Diaoyu, it would mark an unnecessary escalation. Japan&apos;s sovereignty over this group of rocks is longstanding, and China&apos;s renewed claim to them is by comparison recent, although this too is disputed. But as neither side has done anything to assert their rival claims, an uneasy peace, broken only by fishing squalls, has prevailed. It is often forgotten that a third power is involved in the dispute \u2013 Taiwan. This is the land to which the islands are closest and with which they are geologically linked. Japan&apos;s relationship with Taiwan has none of the prickliness of its relations with the Chinese mainland. Taiwan&apos;s re-elected President Ma Ying-jeou recently proposed an initiative to shelve the sovereignty dispute and jointly develop the resources that lie around and below the islands. This is the best solution but, being reasonable and internationalist, it is one that could all too easily get drowned out. Japan&apos;s purchase of the islands from their private owners was an attempt to stop nationalists from staging provocative acts. But that in turn provoked waves of attacks on Japanese businesses in China. It would not be the first time that an incoming prime minister abandons an election pledge but that is what Shinzo Abe should now do. China is Japan&apos;s biggest trading partner, and, if he wants to last longer than he did the first time he was premier, Mr Abe should play the long game. That means not upsetting the status quo whereby Japanese sovereignty is maintained by nothing more threatening than coastguard vessels.

Hansen&apos;s main gripe is that Google&apos;s use of &quot;anonymous&quot; is misleading. &quot;All available information points to having linkable identifiers per user,&quot; she told Computerworld.

The stars are liars: how Twitter outs celebrity smartphone shills &gt;&gt; The Verge Russell Brandom:   while the brands might not be thrilled at this telephonic two-timing, many industry analysts believe that, in cases of product placement, these indiscretions won&apos;t hurt the products at all. Michael Kamins, Director of Research at the Stony Brook Business College, who has studied celebrity endorsements, put it this way: &quot;Product placement works on a link towards cognition and awareness. It doesn&apos;t necessarily make people like the product, but it gets exposure.&quot;   The iPod used celebrity &quot;endorsement&quot; (read: use) to great effect. Apple learnt that lesson from Sony, which did it with the Walkman. (Thanks @beardyweirdy666 for the link.) The Letter - Where&apos;s my Nexus 4 - Register Your Complaint Started by an annoyed user, who has lots agreeing:   When it comes to communicating what is happening with the orders and money, for the LG Nexus 4, it is confusing at best, most would describe it as a shambles.  I have started a site for people to register their complaints and will provide it to you in time. It contains hundreds of very unhappy people, and the site itself is receiving thousands of unique, return visitors, indicating the scale of the problem. I will forward these on to you at your request.  We can clearly see the following details emerging; customers who have had money taken from their account, and were initially informed their estimated delivery date was 3-5 working days has been and gone. When we have called to ask what is happening, it is obvious from the contrasting information given out by Google employees, that not even they know what is going on. It is also evident that orders are not being fulfilled in a &quot;first come first served&quot; fashion, which is extremely disheartening for everybody involved.    (See our story.) The psychology of online reviews &gt;&gt; British Psychological Society  A few mouse clicks and sites like Trip Advisor and Amazon offer us an abundance of reviews written by strangers. Yet, how they affect our judgements has been little researched.  Now Brent Coker has conducted a pair of studies and his main finding suggests that we remain impressed after reading early positive reviews, even if negative reviews come later. It&apos;s a finding that could help us be more objective when reading review pages, and it will surely also be of interest to marketeers and PR professionals hoping to give their products an advantage.  Seventy-six undergrads were told all positive facts about one fictional coffee brand and all negative facts about another, along the lines of: &quot;the company has put green policies in place&quot; and &quot;the company has tried to cover up exploitation of its workers&quot;.

Huawei, ZTE trade lawsuits &gt;&gt; Xinhua  Huawei Technologies, the bigger rival by sales, sued ZTE claiming patent and trademark infringement in Germany, France, and Hungary on April 28, the company said in a news release.  ZTE retaliated the next day, saying it had filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Huawei in China, accusing it of infringing ZTE&apos;s LTE-related patents.  The lawsuits, among the many that have taken place in the telecom industry, reflected that companies want to gain the upper hand in a new round of construction related to next-generation networks by accusing rivals of infringing on property rights, analysts said.  Huawei said ZTE is infringing on its patents related to data-card and Long Term Evolution (LTE) - a high-speed mobile Internet standard - technologies. It also said ZTE used a trademark registered by Huawei on some of its products.   Android handset maker v Android handset maker. Pick a side.

Almost three-quarters of a century later, Chamberlain would be even more amazed at the degree to which other peoples, their aspirations and their problems had a direct impact on Britain \u2013 and all the other countries of the world \u2013 in 2012. Rapidly accelerating interconnectedness was an inescapable fact of life across the planet. The internet, social media, mobile telephony, instant digital publication and satellite communication ensured that events, both benign and malign, significant and trivial, were a shared global experience. In 2012, there was less excuse than ever for &quot;knowing nothing&quot;. Armed conflict Syria&apos;s escalating civil war claimed most headlines. With the estimated death toll rising above 40,000, President Bashar al-Assad&apos;s bloody struggle to cling to power symbolised the sharp end of the Arab Spring. Worries intensified that the conflict might spread to Iraq, Lebanon and Turkey \u2013 which asked Nato to deploy Patriot missile defences along its border. Elsewhere the Arab revolutions proceeded less violently or not at all. By year&apos;s end Egypt and Jordan were showing renewed signs of instability. In Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and other Gulf monarchies, the lid on the pressure cooker was still screwed down tight. The eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo collapsed once more into rebellious mayhem under the unseeing eyes of UN peacekeepers. Varying degrees of global indifference attended continuing conflicts in Somalia, Yemen and Afghanistan (where western troops&apos; race to the exit gathered pace). Mali, after a coup, gained more attention due to the &quot;al-Qaida effect&quot; \u2013 alarm felt by western governments at the infiltration of jihadis bent on destabilising Algeria and Nigeria and terrorising Europe. Global standoffs Iran and its suspect nuclear programme topped 2012&apos;s heap of unresolved diplomatic problems \u2013 and 2013&apos;s things-to-do list. If Binyamin Netanyahu wins Israel&apos;s January polls and Tehran continues to up its uranium enrichment totals, the spectre of military confrontation will loom large again, as it did for much of 2012. North Korea&apos;s missile testing and general paranoia were another headache. Elsewhere on the WMD front, fears grew that Syria&apos;s regime might use chemical weapons. President Mahmoud Abbas achieved much-needed applause for winning Palestine non-member observer status at the UN. But Hamas in Gaza, engaging in another missile war, and a new wave of Occupied Territories settlements intended to punish Abbas for his temerity, reminded everybody that, like the poor, the Israel-Palestine conflict is always with us. The long-awaited rehabilitation of Cuba, courtesy of Barack Obama, failed to materialise (again), while speculation swirled around the health of Fidel Castro (retired) and Cuba&apos;s key Venezuelan ally, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez (re-elected). Burma fared better: Obama rewarded a year of impressive reforms with a visit to Rangoon, part of his so-called policy &quot;pivot to Asia&quot;. Elsewhere, Armenia and Azerbaijan threatened a new war over an old problem (Nagorno-Karabakh), Argentina resurrected its Falklands/Malvinas grievances, and Pakistan&apos;s ruling secular elite and Islamist fundamentalists continued their undeclared civil war, fuelled by Afghan violence and American drones. Increasing interest (and alarm) centred on energy-related territorial disputes in the South and East China seas, broadly pitting China against Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and others, and Japan against South Korea. Confrontations at sea inflamed nationalist passions. As a harbinger of things to come, China launched its first aircraft carrier. The US was busy strengthening regional alliances \u2013 criticised by Beijing as a crude attempt at containment. New Zealand was among countries agreeing closer defence links. Winners and losers After many scares and a disastrous first TV debate, Obama won a second term, against the economic odds and thanks mainly to a weak Republican challenge. In France, Nicolas Sarkozy received his marching orders, a victim of hard times and too much hype. Within weeks, his successor, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, was in deep trouble and Sarko, if he can dodge jail for alleged corruption, was planning a comeback. Russia&apos;s patented system of &quot;managed democracy&quot; (where you have an election but the result is decided in advance) worked well again for Vladimir Putin, who swapped the prime minister&apos;s job for a return to the presidency. China&apos;s communist-capitalist leadership handled the regular 10-year transition even more smoothly. After months of predictions that Xi Jinping would get the top job, the 18th party congress convened and after careful deliberation selected \u2026 Xi Jinping! But who is Xi? We still don&apos;t know. In Mexico, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto assumed the presidency with a pledge to reduce hunger, poverty and violence. In Taiwan, President Ma Ying-jeou won a second term on his record of improving ties with China. Also elected in 2012 was Pauline Marois, leader of Quebec&apos;s separatists. Her celebrations were marred by a shootout, underscoring what an exciting place modern Canada can be. Important stuff Lana Del Rey definitively emerged as the edgiest female vocalist of 2012, a British cyclist won the Tour de France without taking drugs, and for the first time in history a South Korean pop product \u2013 Psy&apos;s Gangnam Style \u2013 obtained global applause.

The arrival of an indigenous edition of fashion&apos;s most famous glossy magazine has become a barometer of the emergence of an affluent middle class, and a siren call to a luxury industry looking for new markets. Launches in Thailand and Ukraine next year will bring the number of international Vogues to 21. Until the 1960s, there were only five editions of Vogue: in the US, UK, France, Italy and Australia. In the past 40 years, economic growth around the globe has been tracked by the arrival of Vogue editors: Russia, Japan, Korea and Taiwan have had their own Vogues since the 1990s, while the first decade of the 21st century saw launches in China and India, among others. The launch of Turkish Vogue two years ago indicated the country&apos;s emergence as a luxury market. Because the printing cost of a copy of Vogue is much higher than the cover price, advertising is crucial. For this reason, the appetite of the luxury industry to reach consumers in a country is what brings Vogue to the newsstand. As Cond\u00e9 Nast&apos;s chairman, Jonathan Newhouse, said when announcing the 2013 launch of a Kiev-based edition of his magazine: &quot;The Ukraine is ready for Vogue \u2026 Kiev is booming, and there is a strong market demand for luxury products and the experience Vogue can offer the reader.&quot; But the arrival of Vogue has also become a badge of sophistication for a country. The desire among consumers for a Vogue specific to that country, rather than imported editions, grows as a middle class gains confidence. The lofty, imperial decrees of a magazine printed in a distant western capital no longer satisfy women secure in their own ideals of style and beauty and looking for publications which reflect these. When Turkish Vogue launched in 2010, the 562-page debut issue boasted 252 pages of advertising including Dior, Escada and D&amp;G and the masthead featured Mary Fellowes, formerly of British Vogue \u2013 but at the Paris launch party, the editor in chief chose a dress by Turkish designer Hakaan Yildirim. Vogue Thailand recently provided a teaser cover image of its debut cover, featuring the Thai model Si Tanwiboon, who has walked in Paris fashion week shows including Jean Paul Gaultier and Louis Vuitton. Each edition of Vogue takes on something of the character of that country. Japanese Vogue is eccentric and edgy, reflecting the lively fashion cultures of Tokyo. Russian Vogue is edited by Victoria Davydova, whose graduate thesis was on the financial structure of the beauty industry; the models rarely smile. Indian Vogue has had Indian models on every cover in 2012, but this is unusual. China had the Beijing-born model Liu Wen on three consecutive September issues, but has also featured the US models Arizona Muse and Karlie Kloss in 2012. Spanish Vogue&apos;s cover models this year included Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, but also Kate Moss dressed as a matador. Vogue Brazil most often features Brazilian models, in particular Gisele B\u00fcndchen, but in Korean Vogue a run of blond models has included Britain&apos;s Cara Delevingne, the Dutch Lara Stone and the American Carolyn Murphy. Japanese Vogue aroused controversy when a video of a shoot with the US model Crystal Renn appeared to show her temples being pulled back to give her eyes a more Japanese appearance. The magazine insisted the technique is commonly used to define bone structure on camera, and was not intended to alter ethnicity."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/dec/21/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2012-12-21T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google", "Motorola"], "sentences": ["Nokia to resume development of 10-inch Windows RT tablet, say Taiwan makers &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Nokia has talked about cooperation with Microsoft, Qualcomm and Compal Electronics to resume development of a 10-inch Windows RT tablet, and is likely to unveil the model at the 2013 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, during February 25-28, according to Taiwan-based supply chain makers."], "title": "Boot up: RIM's bad numbers, EU to bite Samsung, Apple and patents, and more", "article": "A quick burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Patents: that word does not mean what you think it means &gt;&gt; TechPinions Steve Wildstrom, on the USPTO &quot;invalidating&quot; Apple&apos;s patent (see below):   In this case, the challenge was filed by Samsung and, as is the normal practice, its challenge was considered without any response from Apple (that&apos;s what ex parte means.) [Matt] Macari cites USPTO statistics (PDF) that such request are granted over 90% of the time. Apple now gets to come in an defend its patent before the USPTO - Samsung isn&apos;t actually a party to the case. In a bit under 70% of such cases, some of the claims of the original patent are invalidated in reexamination while the rest are upheld; the patent in question contains 21 claims. About 11% of the time, all claims are rejected, leaving the patent invalid.   Macari, mentioned there, writes for The Verge, and is an intellectual property lawyer by training. RIM 3Q fiscal 2013 quarterly results &gt;&gt; RIM (PDF)  Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 was $2.7bn, down 5% from $2.9bn in the previous quarter and down 47% from $5.2bn in the same quarter of fiscal 2012. The revenue breakdown for the quarter was approximately 60% for hardware, 36% for service and 4% for software and other revenue.  During the quarter, RIM shipped approximately 6.9m BlackBerry smartphones and approximately 255,000 BlackBerry PlayBook tablets.   That&apos;s the lowest smartphone shipments since the same period in 2009. It had an operating loss of $230m, and most crucially of all lost subscribers - 80m previous quarter, 79m this. That last figure is the really dangerous one.  Also: RIM&apos;s quarter ended 1 December. The BB10 phones are being announced on 30 January. So that&apos;s two months of the current quarter without new products.  EU to file formal complaint against Samsung &gt;&gt; MarketWatch  European Union regulators plan to issue a formal complaint against Samsung Electronics within weeks in its anti-trust probe over patents, EU&apos;s competition chief Joaquin Almunia said Thursday.  The commission, which acts as the EU&apos;s competition watchdog, is investigating whether Samsung&apos;s past use of injunctions against Apple violated antitrust rules.  &quot;We will issue a statement of objections very soon, I don&apos;t know if at the end of this year or at beginning of next year, because we are in the last step of our internal procedure,&quot; Almunia said, referring to the formal charge sheet issued by the commission.   In case you haven&apos;t followed it: Samsung used standards-essential patents to fight Apple in court battles, seeking injunctions (sales bans). But if you submit your patent for a standard, you agree that you&apos;ll always license it, judged by a court if necessary. An injunction is in effect a refusal to let the court decide or to license.  This also confirms that the reason Samsung stopped seeking injunctions on SEPs on Tuesday (but not seeking injunctions on non-SEPs, or on SEPs in other countries) was because it got wind it was in trouble with the EU.

Google sweetened Motorola deal with Arris by promising to cap liability In TiVo&apos;s billion-dollar+ patent claim &gt;&gt; TechCrunch  In an October court filing, TiVo claimed that Motorola is responsible for &quot;massive production of infringing DVRs&quot; that &quot;dwarfs the numbers of accused products at issue in TiVo&apos;s previous cases.&quot; The filing also states, &quot;TiVo&apos;s damages claim is likely to run into the billions of dollars,&quot; and it says that TiVo will try to get the courts to stop Motorola from selling the allegedly infringing products. (Motorola has its own patent-infringement claims against TiVo.)  The threat of a huge patent lawsuit would probably cast a cloud over any acquisition talks, but Stanzione said Google has actually agreed to cap Arris&apos; liability in the case to &quot;a very small number.&quot; He didn&apos;t say what that number was, but when one of the analysts on the call asked if Arris might be liable for $1 billion in damages, Stanzione laughed and suggested that it was much lower than that -- and he added that TiVo won&apos;t necessarily win the case.   And so the cost of the Motorola Mobility acquisition goes up again, since Google&apos;s ready to step in and cough up for Arris. (Thanks @modelportfolio2003 for the link.)

Apple stands to lose another patent crucial to its battle with Samsung &gt;&gt; Ars Technica  While Apple had a stunning $1.05 billion trial victory against Samsung this summer, things generally haven&apos;t been going its way since the August verdict. On Monday, US District Judge Lucy Koh ruled that Apple&apos;s case wasn&apos;t strong enough to win an injunction.  With Koh due to publish a post-trial order about damages any day now, a key Apple patent is being threatened at the US Trademark and Patent Office. US Patent No. 7,844,915, the patent covering Apple&apos;s &quot;pinch to zoom&quot; smartphone navigation feature, may be invalidated. In a patent reexam, examiners discovered multiple pieces of prior art that they found should reject Apple&apos;s claims.   Some people have been suggesting that the Apple-Samsung jury should have invalidated the patent, which is nonsensical - they&apos;re not patent examination officers. It&apos;s likely Apple&apos;s patents will still be in place (just) by the time Judge Koh finishes. The question is, will they be valid by the time it reaches the appeal court - and will that have an effect on the appeal? (Thanks @rubbernuke for the link.)

Examining Apple&apos;s security efforts in 2012 &gt;&gt; TidBits Rich Mogull:   The slightest Apple security or privacy glitch creates an instant media frenzy, the online equivalent of the local news telling parents that drinking water will poison their children. 2012 also saw the first widespread, albeit non-damaging, Mac malware. &quot;BYOD&quot; (bring your own device) is the biggest hot-button issue in enterprise security, and is predominantly driven by user demands to support iPhones, iPads, and Macs. I can no longer walk into a meeting with enterprise IT without at least some Macs or iPads in the room, officially supported or not.  This is a nearly complete reversal from just five years ago... Another strong indicator of iOS security is that digital forensics firms, those who produce the software used by law enforcement to recover data from mobile phones and computers, are as yet unable to crack data protected by the highest level of iOS encryption enabled by default (for email and participating apps) when you set a good passcode.

If he revisits a place or genre it&apos;s to tell a very different story \u2013 a martial arts movie in medieval China (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) is followed by a spy thriller in wartime Shanghai (Lust, Caution), and a western with a US civil war background (Ride With the Devil) is succeeded by a western about a gay relationship in present-day Wyoming (Brokeback Mountain). He adopts different styles to fit his new subjects, and while there are certain recurrent themes, among them the disruption of families and young people facing moral and physical challenges, there are no obsessive concerns of the sort once considered a necessity for auteurs. He has a fastidious eye for a great image but he also has a concern for language. His magnificent new film is a version of Yann Martel&apos;s Booker prize-winning novel, Life of Pi, adapted by an American writer, David Magee, whose previous credits were films set in England during the first half of the 20th century, Finding Neverland and Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day. From its opening scene of animals and birds strutting and preening themselves in a sunlit zoo to the final credits of fish and nautical objects shimmering beneath the sea, the movie has a sense of the mysterious, the magical. This effect is compounded by the hallucinatory 3D, and in tone the film suggests Robinson Crusoe rewritten by Laurence Sterne. The form is a story within a story within a story. An unnamed Canadian author whom we assume to be Yann Martel himself (Rafe Spall) is told by an Indian he meets that there is a man in Montreal called Pi who has a story that will make you believe in God. He&apos;s Piscine Molitor Patel (Irrfan Khan), a philosophy teacher, and he tells the curious story of his own extraordinary life, beginning as the son of a zookeeper in Pondicherry, the French\u00a0enclave in India that wasn&apos;t ceded until 1954. The movie&apos;s two central characters both obtained their names by comic accident. The deeply serious Piscine (played by Gautam Belur at five, Ayush Tandon at 12 and Suraj Sharma at 16)was named after an uncle&apos;s favourite swimming pool, the Piscine Molitor in Paris, but changed his name to the Greek letter and numinous number Pi after fellow schoolboys made jokes about pissing. He later became fascinated by a Bengal tiger in the zoo caught by the English hunter Richard Parker who called him Thirsty. On delivery to the zoo their names were accidently reversed and the tiger became Richard Parker. Was this fate or chance? Growing up, the ever curious Pi becomes attracted to religion and the meaning of life, a spiritual journey that the film treats with a respectful wit as the boy rejects his father&apos;s rationalism and creates a personal amalgam of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. His faith is tested as an adolescent when his father is forced to give up the family zoo, where Pi realises he&apos;s been as much a captive as the animals themselves. A Japanese freighter becomes a temporary ark on which the Patel family take the animals to be sold in Canada. But it&apos;s struck by a storm as dramatic as anything ever put on the screen, and Pi becomes a combination of Noah, Crusoe, Prospero and Job. Alone above the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the Pacific, he&apos;s an orphan captaining a lifeboat with only a zebra, a hyena, a female orang-utan and the gigantic Bengal tiger Richard Parker for company.           This is grand adventure on an epic scale, a survival story that takes up half the movie. It&apos;s no Peaceable Kingdom like Edward Hicks&apos;s charming early 19th-century painting, where the lion sleeps with the lamb. This is a Darwinian place that Pi must learn to command. Using state-of-the-art 3D and digitally created beasts, Lee and his team of technicians make it utterly real, as they do a mysterious island that briefly provides a dangerously seductive haven. The 227 days at sea are a test of physique, mental adaptation and faith, and Suraj Sharma makes Pi&apos;s spiritual journey as convincing as his nautical one. He confronts thirst and starvation, finds a modus vivendi with the fierce tiger, endures and wonders at a mighty storm, a squadron of flying fish, a humpbacked whale, a school of dolphins, a night illuminated by luminous jellyfish. This brave new world is observed by a young Chilean director of photography, appropriately named Claudio Miranda. The movie does for water and the sea what Lawrence of Arabia did for sand and desert, and one thinks of what Alfred Hitchock, who used 3D so imaginatively in his 1954 film of Dial M For Murder, might have done on his wartime Lifeboat had he been given such technical facilities. This poetic Life of Pi concludes with a fascinating, deliberately prosaic coda that raises questions about the reality of what we&apos;ve seen and confronts the teleological issues involved. One thinks of the reporter&apos;s remark at the end of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance: &quot;When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.&quot; At another level, Sam Goldwyn&apos;s advice to the screenwriter comes to mind: &quot;Give me the story and send the message by Western Union.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/dec/23/france-cheddar-cheese-sales-boom", "publicationDate": "2012-12-23T14:24:14Z", "tags": ["Cheese", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Food & drink industry", "Business", "France", "Europe", "World news"], "sentences": ["Scotch is popular in the US, France, Taiwan and Germany as well as emerging markets such as Venezuela, Mexico, China and India."], "title": "France develops a taste for British cheddar", "article": "&quot;They do take a lot of convincing,&quot; admitted Marie Quatrehomme, an award-winning Parisian cheesemonger, &quot;but once they do, they&apos;re very happy with it.&quot;&apos; The problem, she said from her illustrious Left Bank cheese shop, Quatrehomme, is that &quot;cheddar is well-liked by the French once they try it, but at the same time it&apos;s very little known.&quot; Slowly, though, the French palate \u2013 spoiled after being weaned on the ripest brie and most sumptuous camembert \u2013 is coming round to the idea of British cheddar. &quot;Its appeal in France lies in its wonderful shape and texture and in the fact that it is very close in appearance to the French cheese cantal and yet has a totally different taste,&quot; says Quatrehomme. &quot;We stock cheddar all year, but I&apos;ve just taken a large order for Christmas and I&apos;m really proud to offer my customers two of the best varieties.&quot; But the rise of cheddar is arguably best exemplified by the success of Cathedral City, made by Dairy Crest and\u00a0recently voted one of Britain&apos;s favourite brands, which entered the French market five years ago and now sells about a quarter of a million packets every year. Sales in France are up steadily 5% year on year. Another British brand, Wyke Farms from Somerset, the UK&apos;s largest independent cheese producer and milk processor, is now stocked in Intermarch\u00e9, Monoprix and other big French supermarkets. British cheese generally has never been as popular abroad, according to Nigel White, secretary of the British Cheese Board, an education body funded by British cheesemakers. &quot;120,000 tonnes of British cheese was exported last year across the world \u2013 more than double the amount 10 years ago,&quot; he said. Before then, British cheeses were too mild for continental tastes, said White. &quot;Until 1990, about 60% of cheddars made in Britain were mild. Now, two-thirds are mature, which appeal more to countries used to stronger cheeses. I think historically we used to send out cheese to the rest of the world that was too young. There was nothing wrong with it, but it didn&apos;t have a very strong\u00a0flavour.&quot; Stilton has long found foreign favour, and now more than 1,000 tonnes are produced for the export market each year, said White. But these days, that once respectable variety has been dwarfed by cheddar exports, which have reached 35,000 tonnes a year. The French were always nationalistic about their cheese, said White, reluctant to eat anything made beyond their borders. But they are now getting a taste for artisan cheddars \u2013 particularly West Country farmhouse cheddar, a protected product that by law has to be made by hand in south-west England. Until seven or eight years ago, Cathedral City&apos;s foreign market comprised homesick expats who would get their cheddar fix from English food shops, said Jackie Wilson, the brand&apos;s marketing manager. Now, though, the company has its sights on expanding the foreign business, which has grown by 10-15% year on year. France isn&apos;t the only country falling for Cathedral City. The international sales manager, Gavin Cartland, said: &quot;Our biggest markets outside the UK (where retail sales are worth \u00a3253m this year) are Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, Benelux and Scandinavia.&quot; Total European retail sales were \u20ac8m (\u00a36.49m) this year. Germany is the biggest market. In 2010, no other cheese brand grew as fast over there, with volume increasing 40% year on year. Cartland and his team tailor their marketing for different foreign tastes. &quot;The Swiss tend to like eating cheddar for breakfast, Germans tend to use it like us, in sandwiches, on potatoes and everywhere else. The Spanish use it as a cooking ingredient, particularly with pasta or seafood.&quot; Cathedral City&apos;s appeal \u2013 to foreigners and Britons alike \u2013 is partly based on its packets being emblazoned with an olde-worlde church, and customers probably imagine the cheese is churned by godfearing monks in a monastery in some ancient English town. In fact, it is made on an industrial scale in Davidstow, Cornwall, which does not have a cathedral and is not a city.

Perhaps, like the Cuban missile crisis, they can stretch to weeks or, like the prelude to war in 1914, even months. But the Iranian nuclear crisis, which began with the revelation of secret nuclear sites in 2002, has now lasted a full decade. Although some might consider 10 years without war to be a success, it would be foolish to assume we can endure another 10. It is now more important than ever that we take advantage of fortuitous diplomatic circumstances and seek a deal with Iran, one which both addresses our basic security concerns and allows Iran to come away with dignity. The window for nuclear diplomacy between Iran and the west has been open since Barack Obama&apos;s re-election. But it will start inching shut as we approach the Iranian presidential elections in June. The same election-season policy paralysis that grips Washington every four years also afflicts Tehran. Iran&apos;s political system has been especially fragmented during president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&apos;s second term, and factional competition will intensify. Since negotiations can&apos;t be held before January, that leaves a short period \u2013 no more than five months \u2013 in which to hammer out an agreement. Everyone understands what the compromise should look like. The west would offer limited sanctions relief and, despite UN security council resolutions demanding the contrary, would allow Iran to enrich uranium. Iran, in turn, would cap its enrichment to 5%, thus excluding the production of uranium enriched to the more dangerous 20% (nine-tenths of the way to weapons-grade). Iran would also have to agree to convert its stockpile to fuel (which is harder to use for bombs), limit its ability to produce more in the future, and \u2013 most important of all \u2013 agree to intrusive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The latter is a crucial point. If Iran did seek to dash for a bomb, its main problem would not be getting material, but getting caught. We must ensure it stays that way. We should, counterintuitively, prefer a bigger, more transparent Iranian nuclear programme to a smaller, more opaque one. Finally, if and when the agency gives Iran a clean bill of health \u2013 something it cannot do now, while Iran remains unco-operative \u2013 all sanctions could be lifted. Iran may be worried that if it comes clean, it would simply face further punishment. There is a solution: in return for total transparency, Iran should be offered an amnesty for past transgressions. After all, many countries \u2013 South Korea, Taiwan, Sweden, South Africa \u2013 have conducted illicit nuclear research, and been forgiven. The problem, as so often in negotiations, is that each side is convinced it can outlast the other. We assume that Iran, creaking under the weight of unprecedentedly tough sanctions, will eventually agree to far greater concessions than those outlined above. This may be a mistake. First, long-term sanctions can have catastrophic humanitarian and diplomatic effects, as they did in Iraq in the 1990s. In those western countries spearheading sanctions, there is disturbingly little debate over the consequences. Second, the longer the crisis lasts, the greater the risk that Israel, fearful of Iran making unseen advances in the development of a nuclear bomb, launches air strikes. That would result in Iran expelling inspectors, reconstituting its nuclear programme out of sight, and redoubling its efforts \u2013 just as Iraq did after it was bombed by Israel in 1981. Finally, it may seem desirable that sanctions drive Iranians on to the streets. But such protests, by making the regime more vulnerable, can increase the appeal of a nuclear deterrent and empower hardliners. Moreover, as we found during the 2009 green revolution, it can be politically awkward to negotiate with a regime visibly cracking down on its citizens. That undermines the core purpose of sanctions: to negotiate from a position of strength. There are other reasons why we should show flexibility. The Obama administration has already indicated it is willing to engage in direct talks with Iran, but a president is never as politically strong as at the beginning of a second and final term. Moreover, the increasingly probable collapse of the Assad regime in Syria will deprive Iran of one of its only true allies. When that happens, Tehran&apos;s stance can be expected to harden further. Iran might simply refuse to make the necessary concessions. In that case, we are no worse off than we are now. But it would be negligent not to try. Considering that every internationally recognised nuclear weapons state took less than 10 years to produce their bombs, the duration of this crisis is remarkable and troubling. Just waiting Iran out is not a good strategy. Sanctions may have played a role in forcing Iran back to nuclear talks over the past year, but they can no longer do all the heavy lifting."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/26/uk-moves-up-economic-league-table", "publicationDate": "2012-12-26T00:06:01Z", "tags": ["Economic growth (GDP)", "Economics", "Business", "Global economy", "UK news", "Brazil", "World news", "India"], "sentences": ["Thailand goes up six places from number 30 in 2012 to 24 in 2022; Taiwan from 27th to 20th and Korea from 15th to 12th."], "title": "UK moves up economic league table", "article": "Britain moved up to sixth in the global economic league table during 2012, overtaking Brazil despite a year of flatlining activity.

The CEBR said it would take until 2014 for Brazil to once again supplant the UK in its World Economic League Table (WELT), and that by 2017 Britain would also have fallen behind a fast-rising India. Douglas McWilliams, CEBR chief executive, said: &quot;The Indians have lost to us at cricket this winter but they are on track to beat us at economics. By 2017 we predict that the Indian economy will be the largest economy in the Commonwealth, overtaking the UK economy. &quot;We are beating some other countries, though.

From 2014 onwards, however, their more dynamic economy is likely to pull them decisively beyond us.&quot; Although the first official estimate of UK growth will not be published until late January 2013, the Bank of England and the Treasury believe that there will be a small fall in output in the final three months of the year, leaving GDP virtually unchanged between 2011 and 2012. The five biggest economies in the world in 2012 were the same as in 2011, with the US followed by China, Japan, Germany and France. The CEBR said that the three top spots would remain unchanged for the next decade, although China&apos;s economy would by then by 83% as big as America&apos;s and catching up fast. By 2022, the report said India would be the fourth biggest economy in the world, with Russia up to seventh and bigger than every country in Western Europe apart from Germany.

Indonesia, currently, the world&apos;s 16th largest economy is forecast to rise six places to enter the world&apos;s top 10 in 2022. Other Asian economies also move up the ranking. Thailand goes up six places from number 30 in 2012 to 24 in 2022; Taiwan from 27th to 20th and Korea from 15th to 12th.

Should you trust app store reviews? &gt;&gt; Terence Eden  If you&apos;re an average customer, reviews can be worse than useless for determining whether an app is any good. It can be hard to determine if a negative review is the fault of the app - or the user&apos;s phone. Is the reviewer the sort of cretin who complains that a \u00a30.99 app doesn&apos;t have the same polish as a \u00a340 video game? Has the reviewer misspelt even the most basic words? These are all warning signs that a reviewer should not be trusted.  Yet, even knowing all these things, it&apos;s easy to be seduced by a negative or positive review that sounds plausible but is what we in the industry call &quot;total unmitigated bollocks.&quot;  So, gentle reader, I present perhaps the best app review in the Google Play App Store.   And he does. But also has some useful suggestions on how you could get app reviews that would have meaning. The LINUX TABLET IS THE FUTURE - and it always will be &gt;&gt; The Register Scott Gilbertson:   So far, despite Microsoft&apos;s best efforts, the tablet world is still very much orbiting the twin stars of iOS and Android.  Having used a Samsung Windows 8 tablet for a few months, I have a theory as to why: you think you want a full desktop computer on your tablet - I certainly did -- but you don&apos;t. It simply doesn&apos;t work.  In the case of Windows 8 you can blame some of the &quot;not working&quot; on the buggy, incomplete software that is Windows 8, but not all of the problems can be attributed to a shortcoming of touch APIs.  Much of what makes a full desktop interface terrible on a touch screen tablet is simply the whole desktop paradigm was never designed to be used on a tablet and it shows. The Metro interface for Windows 8 is excellent; different, but in my experience really well done.  Where Windows 8 on a tablet falls apart is when you try to bring the software keyboard to the traditional desktop interface on a tablet. The software keyboard takes up half the screen, which makes even simple tasks difficult. How to you rename a file and move it? First you tap it to select it, then you tap the button to bring up the keyboard, then you type, then you touch away the keyboard, then you touch the file again. It isn&apos;t just awkward and slow; it&apos;s downright antagonizing... [But] There is a device that just might fit the bill for many a Linux user who thinks they&apos;re dreaming of a Linux tablet - the touchscreen laptop.  The touchscreen laptop is exactly the place for an only slightly tweaked OS - touch &quot;optimized&quot; if you will - to succeed. When it&apos;s more convenient to touch the screen you can, but when you need to type there&apos;s a keyboard available.  Internet-connected TVs are used to watch TV, and that&apos;s about all &gt;&gt; NPD Group  The challenge may be that too much choice is creating a complex user experience. There are six or more types of devices bringing the Internet to HDTVs: the TV itself, video game consoles, Blu-ray Disc players, streaming media set top boxes, TiVo, and a few audio/video receivers. While 15 percent of HDTV displays are connected directly to the Internet, that number increases to 29 percent of HDTVs screens due to these other devices. This is driving the availability of around two connected eco-systems on the same TV screen, leading to a confused user-experience as consumers have more than one way of accessing their favorite TV apps.   Six out of ten &quot;smart&quot; TVs are used to watch &quot;over the top&quot; (ie internet), but do you need a smart TV when you&apos;ve got so many other devices that can do &quot;smart&quot; through your TV?

HTC shares jump on strong Butterfly model sales in Japan &gt;&gt; CNA ENGLISH NEWS  According to the KDDI sales data, the 5-inch HTC J Butterfly model surpassed the iPhone 5 during the first week (Dec. 10 to Dec. 16) after its launch in Japan. Also, this particular HTC model was ranked the sixth bestseller in the Japanese smartphone market during the same period.  &quot;Consumers in Japan have been well known to be picky,&quot; Hsu said. &quot;The sales of the HTC&apos;s newest smartphone model are the evidence that the company has made a breakthrough in design and technology to cater to the Japanese.&quot;...  &quot;In the U.S. and Taiwan, HTC has also adopted the same strategy to attract customers. On the back of its improved production technology, in particular the high-definition panel, the model has been a hit,&quot; Hsu said.  The analyst said HTC could very likely achieve its sales target of NT$60bn for the fourth quarter, adding that this sales goal could even be topped on the back of the Butterfly model&apos;s current popularity.   The &quot;Butterfly&quot; is HTC&apos;s &quot;phablet&quot; - its take on the Galaxy Note size. The iPhone 5 first went on sale in Japan on 21 September. As the story suggests, there are five phone selling better in the market, though there&apos;s no indication which ones. (Likely, Samsung and Sony.) Meanwhile, if HTC hits NT$60bn for the quarter, that means its revenues have shrunk by just 40% year-on-year. (Thanks @rquick for the link.)

On the other hand, Apple&apos;s late co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs famously earned an annual $1 salary.  And it&apos;s also worth noting that Cook&apos;s base salary was actually increased from $900,000 last year to $1,400,000 in 2012.

Surprise: only 1% of domains drive over 70% of referring traffic &gt;&gt; Conductor Blog  Not long ago, Rand Fishkin mused about the possibility of a long-tail to the web&apos;s referral traffic (Is There a Long Tail to Referral Traffic?).  He theorized: ...that only ~20% of the referrals that the average website receives comes from the tail of the distribution curve, whilst Matt felt that number should be considerably larger.  Rand&apos;s analysis of several domains (broken out separately below because the number of sites used for the two groups differed) showed that the top 10 referring domains (between 0.33% and 1.47% of the total domains driving traffic) drove between 65% and 88% of all referral traffic.  Quad-core Sony smartphone with 1080p display rumored for CES &gt;&gt; Ars Technica  A quad-core Sony Xperia phone is rumored to debut at CES in January, according the Chinese-language site ePrice. The phone&apos;s screen will rival that of the giant Samsung Galaxy Note series at 5 inches, but will outpace its competitor&apos;s displays with a 1080p resolution.  Rumors have been swirling about a Sony phone meant to compete on the level of LG&apos;s Nexus 4 or HTC&apos;s Droid DNA, both of which launched this past fall. The upcoming Sony phone, designated as the Xperia Z L36h, is reported to have a 13-megapixel backside-illuminated camera, Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 quad-core processor with Adreno 320 GPU, 2GB of RAM, and a microSD slot, according to ePrice.   We&apos;re going to have to find things for all those cores to do. Some of those specifications would look good on a PC of a few years ago. Weak Windows 8 demand saps PC sales, Fujitsu President says &gt;&gt; Bloomberg  Fujitsu, Japan&apos;s biggest provider of computer services, said the company will miss its annual shipment target for personal computers amid slow demand for Microsoft&apos;s Windows 8 operating system.  Initial appetite for the software, introduced in October, is &quot;weak,&quot; Fujitsu President Masami Yamamoto, 58, told reporters in Tokyo yesterday. Slumping demand in Europe amid the sovereign-debt crisis will also erode sales, he said. PC deliveries for the year ending March 31 may be more than 6m units, compared with an October estimate of 7m, he said.   That&apos;s a 15% shortfall. Europe&apos;s economic woes, and the US&apos;s slowing appetite for PCs, are likely to be the explanation used by quite a few chief executives later in January.

Ultrabook vendors concerned about revision of MacBook Air in 2013 &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Apple has issued requests for quotations (RFQ) to Taiwan-based supply chain makers for the revision of several notebook models including MacBook Pro and MacBook Air series in June 2013, causing ultrabook vendors to be concerned, according to supply chain makers.  The sources pointed out that the MacBook Air for 2013 will feature a new processor platform, but its industrial design will not see any major changes.  The sources noted that pressure on ultrabook vendors mainly comes from the Air&apos;s price since Apple is likely to reduce the prices for its existing MacBook Airs before the launch of the new models which could take away demand for ultrabooks.  Scaling to different screens - Building Windows 8 &gt;&gt; MSDN Blogs  Looking at the data about devices in the marketplace today, we see that only 1.2% of active Windows 7 users have screens with a resolution of less than 1024x768. When designing a new platform that supports the devices of today and tomorrow (with undoubtedly higher resolutions) we optimized for the majority of today&apos;s screens (i.e. 98.8%) without sacrificing the experience and complicating the developer story for legacy screens. In addition, the runrate of new PCs with screen sizes of 1024x600 and 1280x720 has dramatically fallen and, to the best of our knowledge, almost no new mainstream PCs are being manufactured with this resolution.   All very true. The surprise is that 1366x768 is the most common screen size for Windows 7, with 42% in use. FAA rules make electronic devices on planes dangerous &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com  Over the last year, flying with phones and other devices has become increasingly dangerous.  In September, a passenger was arrested in El Paso after refusing to turn off his cellphone as the plane was landing. In October, a man in Chicago was arrested because he used his iPad during takeoff. In November, half a dozen police cars raced across the tarmac at La Guardia Airport in New York, surrounding a plane as if there were a terrorist on board. They arrested a 30-year-old man who had also refused to turn off his phone while on the runway.   Nick Bilton says that dealing with the FAA on this is like arguing with a stubborn teenager: there&apos;s no proof of harm, but they won&apos;t change their mind even so until someone proves it&apos;s completely safe - which is a logical impossibility. Opinion: In business, why 2013 is RIM&apos;s BlackBerry year &gt;&gt; Macworld UK Rob Enderle:   As we look ahead to 2013, it&apos;s becoming increasingly clear that the new year provides an unprecedented opportunity for Research in Motion to make a huge comeback.  This is largely because the market is dominated by two platforms: Android, which is seen as an unsecure malware magnet, and iOS, which comes from a firm that has never learned to spell &quot;IT.&quot; In fact, Apple&apos;s biggest failures were Lisa and the Apple Server, both created on Steve Jobs&apos; watch (Lisa was even his product, initially) and both targeted at the IT market.  While phones and tablets are largely a consumer play, they are increasingly being used for business. Even in a BYOD world, IT still has a great deal of say about the hardware connected to its networks and services. As we start 2013, and as RIM brings out its next-generation products, the company will stand alone as the only mobile solutions provider focused on IT first and the needs of users later.
