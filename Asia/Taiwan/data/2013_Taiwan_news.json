Samsung will give its official estimate of its quarterly profit on Tuesday, and the full earnings statement on 25 January, but analysts surveyed by Reuters offered a consensus showing continued rapid growth up to the December quarter. They predict demand will stay strong ahead of the expected introduction of new smartphones in the spring, particularly in its flagship Galaxy S and &quot;phone-tablet&quot; Note. HTC is expected to make its own push towards the large-format &quot;phablet&quot; range, of phones which have screens more than 5in measured diagonally, after seeing good results from sales of its &quot;Butterfly&quot; range in Japan (called the Droid DNA in the US) in December. But Samsung, which made the running with the Note, is expected to fare better, having sold millions of the devices, particularly in its strongholds in Asia. &quot;[Samsung&apos;s] guidance is unlikely to disappoint given new product launches and a further upturn in cyclical parts of the business,&quot; Morgan Stanley analyst Shawn Kim told Reuters. &quot;Smartphone momentum has not decelerated, despite Apple&apos;s new iPhone, and the business continues to be driven by its flagship products. This time, it&apos;s the Galaxy Note II \u2026 with the upside in unit shipments mainly from the US. We expect strong momentum to continue in the first quarter.&quot; Samsung Electronics also produces memory chips, flat-panel displays, and the central processors used in mobile phones including Apple&apos;s iPhone \u2013 although there are signs that Apple is seeking other suppliers. Samsung has thrived as the world&apos;s largest supplier of Android handsets, selling an estimated 215m smartphones in 2012; the company does not provide figures for unit sales, but briefs analysts with some partial data. While Samsung has grown, HTC \u2013 once was the largest Android provider in the US \u2013 has shrunk, squeezed between Samsung and Apple at the top end, and cheap Chinese Android device makers at the bottom end. Net income before tax crashed by 90% to NT$1.1bn. HTC, which in 2010 had the biggest share of Android smartphones in the US, has come under unrelenting pressure from Samsung during 2012, and monthly revenues have dropped compared to the year-ago period for 14 successive months. But there are signs that the worst might be over for the company, with the fall in monthly revenues easing in November and December. HTC has struggled to compete on volume and price with Apple and Samsung. Although it does not provide shipment figures, analysts reckon that shipments dwindled by a third from 12.1m in the third quarter 2011 to 8.4m in the same period last year. But the company is now pushing into the phablet space, and has its sights on the market \u2013 which research group Strategy Analytics forecasts will be one of the big hits of 2013: some think that it could make up a quarter of all smartphones sold by 2017, compared to just 11% in 2012."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/07/laura-robson-grand-slam-final", "publicationDate": "2013-01-07T15:43:33Z", "tags": ["Laura Robson", "Australian Open", "Tennis", "Sport", "Australia sport"], "sentences": ["Against Li I did that for 2\u00bc hours.&quot; Robson still feels a lingering disappointment that she then lost to Stosur and did not win her first WTA title a few weeks later in Guangzhou, China, when 3-0 up in the third set of the final against Hsieh Su-wei of Taiwan."], "title": "Laura Robson: I want to make a grand slam final like Andy Murray", "article": "Laura Robson talks effortlessly about reading and travelling, about doping in cycling and the contrasting panache of Roger Federer, and sounds as worldly as she is intelligent. Even when she rolls out an alternative dream in which, rather than being a teenager on the verge of a significant breakthrough in professional tennis, she opens a small bakery, Robson remains wry and intriguing. It is easy to see how, after the most successful year of her career, she may make even greater progress in 2013. Last year Robson reached the fourth round of the US Open, sending Kim Clijsters into retirement while beating another grand slam winner in Li Na, currently ranked world No7, before finally losing a match she could have won to the defending champion, Sam Stosur. A few weeks earlier Robson and Andy Murray had won silver in the mixed doubles at the London Olympics and then, in September, she became the first British woman in 22 years to reach a WTA final. On Monday, in the new world rankings, she moved into the world&apos;s top 50. Yet the 18-year-old is more intent on poring over an old photograph and, for the first time in an hour, she appears startled. &quot;Goodness,&quot; Robson exclaims, using a very old-fashioned word. &quot;I look so young \u2026 and, ah, Grigor!&quot; Robson points fondly at Grigor Dimitrov, as if spotting her first boyfriend, and shakes her head at the speed of the passing years. In the photograph, Robson and Dimitrov show each other their respective singles trophies for having won Junior Wimbledon in 2008. &quot;I look pretty tired, don&apos;t I?&quot; Robson says, tapping a photo taken at the post-tournament ball. &quot;It was way past my bedtime. It&apos;s pretty cool to look at pictures like this \u2013 even if it&apos;s crazy to think that I could have still played juniors in 2012 if I&apos;d wanted.&quot; Robson, instead, lost a three-setter in the opening round of the main Wimbledon draw to Francesca Schiavone, another grand slam champion. &quot;I wasn&apos;t so happy,&quot; Robson remembers, &quot;but straight after Wimbledon I went to Palermo and made my first WTA semi-final. That was a big step \u2013 especially on clay which is my worst surface. So my confidence was growing. &quot;I then played two good singles matches in the Olympics. I beat [Lucie] Safarova and then my next match against [Maria] Sharapova was very tight. She&apos;s world No2 but I probably should have won that first set. It&apos;s all a learning experience \u2013 and, after that, I was very happy to be with Andy. He&apos;s so easy to play with and getting to the final meant a lot. &quot;You should have seen Andy before our semi-final. He was super pumped-up because the mixed doubles was extremely tough. There were only 16 pairs and so virtually everyone was ranked really high. We would&apos;ve loved to have won the final [against the Belarusians Max Mirnyi and Victoria Azarenka \u2013 the current world No1 woman] and we took the first set. But then I just couldn&apos;t return Mirnyi&apos;s serve as it was just so fast. It was still an incredible day.&quot; Murray won the Olympic singles title and, more stunningly, his first grand slam at the US Open. &quot;I was back home [in Southfields, a short walk from Wimbledon] for the final,&quot; Robson says. &quot;It was the day of the Olympic parade and when he went two sets up my mum said: &apos;I&apos;m going to sleep because he&apos;s going to win this.&apos; I said: &apos;Stop talking!&apos; I was right. It went to five sets but I was so happy for Andy.&quot; As she watched Murray beat Novak Djokovic did Robson imagine herself eventually replicating his achievement? &quot;Yeah, you do think: &apos;I really want to be in a final like that one day.&apos; That&apos;s my goal, really. That&apos;s what I&apos;m working towards. At the end of 2011 my ranking was 125. Twelve months on I&apos;m [50] in the world. It&apos;s a big jump but I can go a lot further.&quot; She is younger than 98 other players in the top 100. &quot;I&apos;m the second youngest,&quot; she grins. &quot;A German girl, Annika Beck, also made it [at 78] and she&apos;s three weeks younger than me.&quot; Robson is impressively matter-of-fact when asked if, before playing Clijsters in New York, she went through any specific psychological preparation \u2013 for the Belgian had won 15 consecutive matches at Flushing Meadows in the midst of securing two successive US Open titles in 2009 and 2010. Only injury prevented her attempting a hat-trick the following year. The 2012 US Open was also Clijsters&apos;s last tournament before she retired. Surely Robson needed to steel herself? &quot;Not really. It was a match that, going into it, I felt I could win. She wasn&apos;t playing her best tennis and I was confident. I knew if I stuck to the game plan I could get through it. In the past I&apos;ve had some tough matches against the top players where I&apos;ve had a really close first set and then lost the second routinely. I thought: &apos;I&apos;m not going to allow myself to do that.&apos; And I didn&apos;t.&quot; Her subsequent defeat of Li Na was even more telling. &quot;She had just won Cincinnati [a tournament in which Robson had lost in qualifying] so I knew it was going to be super tough. I was disappointed to lose the second set because I was close to winning it. I knew I could play at that level but it was just a case of being able to do it for a whole match. Against Li I did that for 2\u00bc hours.&quot; Robson still feels a lingering disappointment that she then lost to Stosur and did not win her first WTA title a few weeks later in Guangzhou, China, when 3-0 up in the third set of the final against Hsieh Su-wei of Taiwan. &quot;I felt completely drained at that point. It was so hot and I sat down and started downing gels and energy drinks. I was slipping a little and she saw that and found some energy.&quot; During the last six weeks of 2012, apart from a three-day break in Southfields over Christmas, Robson has worked under a brutal regime in Boca Raton, Florida \u2013 where Murray&apos;s fitness trainer, Jez Green, and her coach Zeljko Krajan have prepared her for next week&apos;s Australian Open. &quot;I&apos;ve put in a lot of strength, speed and endurance work. I&apos;m feeling stronger and faster.&quot; Robson strikes the ball beautifully and has a formidable forehand and a powerful serve. But her mobility and variety of stroke need to improve. &quot;Consistency too,&quot; she says. &quot;But I&apos;m working on my mobility every day. I really want to chase down balls and make it difficult for my opponent.&quot; In contrast Heather Watson, ranked three places ahead of Robson at 47, needs to hit the ball harder to boost her own more fluid mobility. Three weeks after Robson came close in Guangzhou, Watson won the Japan Open. She was the first British woman to win a WTA event since 1988 and their parallel rise is likely to continue \u2013 even if Robson&apos;s heavy-hitting is more suited to the highest level. Talking at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton, and highlighting the support that Aegon has given her and Watson, Robson says: &quot;Recently there have been lots more questions about the two of us and our &apos;budding rivalry&apos;. But we&apos;re friends and I played my first team event with Heather when I was 10 and she was 12. While we&apos;re competitive, we also want each other to do well.&quot; Could Watson reach the top 10? &quot;Why not? She has the movement and she played really well last year.&quot; Robson is even more convinced about Murray&apos;s chances of additional grand slam victories. &quot;I definitely think he can do it. He beat Djokovic twice [at the Olympics and US Open] and I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll win a few more.&quot; Does she now know Murray well? &quot;Sort of. We don&apos;t really spend much time together unless I see him at tournaments or in Roehampton \u2013 but he&apos;s very funny. Every time I have nail polish on it&apos;s always disgusting to Andy. There&apos;s never anything wrong with my nails but he makes such fun of me. During the Olympics he was ripping into everyone \u2013 that&apos;s his sense of humour.&quot; Her coach, Krajan, is more renowned for his toughness. But Robson seems amused that, heeding her father&apos;s advice, she and a disgruntled Krajan still fly economy class. &quot;I don&apos;t mind because I just sleep on planes. I think it&apos;s a teenage-thing because Zeljko definitely can&apos;t do it.&quot; Krajan helped propel Dinara Safina to an unlikely world No1 ranking in 2009. Yet Robson is more tickled as she remembers her crush on Safina&apos;s brother, Marat, a former world No1 himself. After she won Junior Wimbledon she was smitten with the Russian. &quot;He sent me a letter the year after and then he gave me a birthday card which was very exciting. Maybe that&apos;s something I&apos;ll never grow out of.&quot; Does she feel a similar frisson when walking past the best male players now? &quot;No,&quot; she laughs, &quot;but then I wasn&apos;t interested in Marat&apos;s tennis! But it was really cool at the Olympics because Federer had these special RF pins and I was harassing him for one. I was collecting pins like an animal and he was really cool. We had a few little chats \u2013 and my Federer pin is unbelievable. &quot;At the Olympics you get these little pins and you swap them with people from other countries. Federer has his own special pin and it comes in a red velvet bag. Amazing really. His agent&apos;s kids were getting eight pins for one RF. I managed to swap them just two pins for one RF. So the kids were very annoyed. Their dad was saying: &apos;Just let it go, kids, it&apos;s OK.&apos; That&apos;s definitely the coolest pin I&apos;ve ever had.&quot; Robson might sound like an ordinary teenager but she has surprisingly gritty taste in books. &quot;I read constantly and at the moment I&apos;m devouring The Secret Race by Tyler Hamilton,&quot; she says of the gripping confessional about cycling and doping with which Hamilton skewered Lance Armstrong. &quot;It&apos;s very interesting even if it&apos;s crazy to think about what they got away with. Why would you do that to yourself \u2013 even if it made you No1 in the world? But I guess climbing those mountains is so hard. Looking at Bradley Wiggins you can see what it takes. To win it he lost, what, nine kilos? It&apos;s crazy what they do in cycling. It&apos;s so tough.&quot; Less surprisingly, Robson also immersed herself in The Great British Bake Off \u2013 and reveals that she won a baking competition last year. &quot;There were about nine cakes. I made a chocolate-and-coconut mousse cake with some rum in it and it had a biscuit base. It turned out all right. I usually say I would&apos;ve become a chef if it hadn&apos;t been for tennis. But I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d like all that shouting in the kitchen. If I gave up tennis I&apos;d open a bakery as that&apos;s more relaxed.&quot; Robson&apos;s Cookies has a certain ring? &quot;Why not,&quot; she laughs. &quot;It could be good.&quot; An even better idea, and one to which Robson is fiercely committed, will see her crack the top 10. &quot;I like the sound of that even more,&quot; she says with lip-smacking relish. &quot;I&apos;m hungry to get out there and win lots of matches. I can&apos;t wait to get started again.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/08/life-of-pi-global-vision-cinema", "publicationDate": "2013-01-08T17:09:37Z", "tags": ["Ang Lee", "Film", "Culture", "Life of Pi", "Bollywood", "Film adaptations"], "sentences": ["But a lightbulb flashed over someone&apos;s head, somewhere at Fox, during the development process: Life of Pi&apos;s release schedule was Asia-frontloaded, with Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, India, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Pakistan all within the first fortnight.", "When he moved from Taiwan to the US in 1979 to study theatre, he says he was struck by the differing emphasis of Brecht, Tennessee Williams and other western dramatic heavyweights."], "title": "Life of Pi: a global vision for mainstream cinema", "article": "In Life of Pi, it&apos;s the English actor who is drafted in to speak up for the film&apos;s internationalist credentials. &quot;So far we have an Indian boy named after a French swimming pool on a Japanese ship full of animals heading off to Canada,&quot; the writer played by Rafe Spall says, just before the ordeal on the high seas begins. Or in the words of Paul Hanneman, co-president of international distribution at Fox: &quot;This is truly a global picture. You&apos;ve got multiple religions; it starts in India and ends in Mexico; but most of the movie takes place on the ocean, so it&apos;s really any man and anywhere.&quot; But it&apos;s in Asia that the impact of Ang Lee&apos;s film \u2013 fast approaching the $400m mark worldwide \u2013 has been truly felt. Among the mostly strong figures in territories across the region were two standout performances: $13m in India, where local star Irrfan Khan and a $1m marketing spend \u2013 the highest ever in distributor Fox Star India&apos;s history \u2013 helped the film punch its weight against Bollywood; and over $90m in China, where it become only the second US film, after Titanic 3D, to gross more than in North America. Chinese filmgoers flocked to social media to debate Lee&apos;s film fable: more than five million messages were exchanged, discussing the meaning of the carnivorous island and the open ending, on Sina Weibo, the country&apos;s Twitter equivalent. &quot;I didn&apos;t realise the movie really has an Asian vibe,&quot; Lee claimed recently. But a lightbulb flashed over someone&apos;s head, somewhere at Fox, during the development process: Life of Pi&apos;s release schedule was Asia-frontloaded, with Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, India, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Pakistan all within the first fortnight. There&apos;s definitely something in the film&apos;s delirious, almost abstract beauty that&apos;s reminiscent of Chinese and Hong Kong cinema aesthetics, and its matter-of-fact syncretism is very Asian, too. Life of Pi seems happy to have the same loosely tethered relationship with western dramatic norms and values as Pi&apos;s raft does with the lifeboat, whether it&apos;s consciously or not in Yann Martel&apos;s original novel, or the rhythms introduced by Lee and screenwriter David Magee over a reported 170 drafts. This pliability isn&apos;t surprising, given Lee&apos;s past cultural circumnavigations. When he moved from Taiwan to the US in 1979 to study theatre, he says he was struck by the differing emphasis of Brecht, Tennessee Williams and other western dramatic heavyweights. &quot;I only understood about half of what was going on, but just the look of western theatre struck me in a big way,&quot; he later told the New Yorker. &quot;You exert your feelings. You outcry. You use drama to do the bang and through that, purge your feelings. It was a big culture shock to me. You&apos;ve got to verbalise conflict on stage. I got very good at it.&quot; Lee used what he had learned when he made Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, returning to the wuxia genre of classical Chinese tradition, but seeding it with western psychoanalytic character-development (the slow, 15-minute, motivation-establishing opening confounded all cut-to-the-furniture-smashing kung fu film conventions). But that film was only a qualified box-office success in Asia at the end of 2000. Lust, Caution stirred up plenty of controversy in China thanks to its focus on collaboration with the Japanese, but its drama ploughed that western psychological furrow. Pi, with its numinously mythic storytelling, feels like a much more thoroughly metamorphosed piece of work. The clamorous Asian response suggests this new east-west fusion is a triumph, able to travel around the globe without attracting attention from the cultural-difference police. Well, almost. It has been a recurring criticism among reviewers \u2013 our own Peter Bradshaw among them \u2013 that Life of Pi lacks the philosophical heft to back up its transcendental visuals, and that the conundrum offered up to us in the final scenes verges on the spiritually glib. It might be tempting to chalk that up to godless western critics bridling at the film&apos;s default religiosity, if it weren&apos;t for the fact that critics from elsewhere have made similar remarks. But it&apos;s undeniable that earnest public discussion of the film seems more deeply rooted in Asia, and sometimes in unexpected ways. This interesting Singaporean report reckons that Chinese tweeters, rather than soaking up a message of spiritual affirmation, have erred towards the bleaker reading of the film that is certainly there too, possibly because it connects with the grislier episodes of the country&apos;s postwar history. I doubt Lee would claim to have &quot;cracked&quot; China \u2013 or Asia. But he looks more and more like an outlier who, whether by design or instinct, is able to produce fluent, sophisticated entertainment that looks like Hollywood but doesn&apos;t necessarily speak it. There aren&apos;t many directors with that kind of flexibility and global sensitivity; as China and other markets continue to come to the fore, it could be directors like Lee who sculpt what the mainstream looks like over the next 25 years. \u2022 Next week&apos;s After Hollywood looks at Quentin Tarantino&apos;s sphere of influence.

As the world&apos;s power base shifts from the US to China, universities in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore are expanding to meet an increased demand for higher education as governments in the region push hard to expand the percentage of their populations who have higher qualifications. Currently only 18% of Hong Kongers and 26% of Singaporeans go to university. This is in stark contrast to the figures for Europe where, for example, 63% of Finnish school leavers go to university, as do 50% of Polish and 47% of Britons. All of which means universities in the region cannot yet fill all the new academic posts from staff native to the region, and so are having to recruit from overseas. The Singaporean Ministry of Education wants to increase the proportion of its young people studying at degree level to 30% by 2015, and it has recently opened four new publicly funded universities to achieve this. It also runs a recruitment programme to attract foreign talent. Tzu-Bin Lin is originally from Taiwan but he lived in the UK for seven years before taking up his current post as assistant professor in education policy and leadership studies at the National Institute of Education at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. He says roughly half the staff at his university are foreign. He says he is earning around the same wage as when he taught at a UK university but he has free accommodation on campus, and taxes and living costs are lower. &quot;For me,&quot; he says, &quot;Singapore is one of the ideal places to work. Higher education is generously funded here, and if you perform well you are rewarded well.&quot; Two of Singapore&apos;s publicly funded universities \u2013 The National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University \u2013 are ranked in the world top 50. The National University of Singapore (NUS) is 25th in the chart. Its president, professor Tan Chorh Chuan, says the focus of his university is on quality, which inevitably means recruiting internationally. NUS has faculty and students from more than 100 countries. &quot;There is a large pool of outstanding academics in the US and Europe, so these regions are important sources of faculty for NUS.&quot; Just a short hop by plane from Singapore, Hong Kong universities are taking the radical step this year of lengthening their degree courses from three years to four in a bid by the government to make university more accessible. Its school leavers will now study a wide variety of subjects in their first year before specialising in their second. Professor Arthur Ellis was recruited by the City University in Hong Kong two years ago to be their provost and help them prepare for the switch and says: &quot;now is a particularly exciting time to be in Hong Kong. The opportunities are extraordinary because of the kind of investments being made in education here.&quot; Ellis thinks the transition from three-year courses to four-year courses is a &quot;major stress test&quot; for the Hong Kong education system. He says City University knows that it needs &quot;significantly more staff&quot; to teach the longer courses, and that the institution would find it &quot;very difficult to fill all the posts from local staff.&quot; Following the recent radical expansion, he adds, &quot;it has been a challenge to get the academic staffing we need for these student\u00a0numbers.&quot; Professor Kar-Yan Tam is associate provost and dean of students at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). He says his university is actively &quot;seeking to foster a highly international, diversified outlook&quot;. He says HKUST is building partnerships with faculties across Europe, the US, Canada, South Korea and mainland China.Tam thinks foreign staff are attracted to working in Hong Kong because it is &quot;an international city with strong East-West elements and a strategic gateway to China and the region as a whole&quot;. Hong Kong has an excellent reputation for its existing higher education provision. Of its eight publicly funded universities, two are in the QS university rankings world top 50, and four are in the top 200. Most prestigious among them are the University of Hong Kong, ranked 23rd, and HKUST, ranked 33rd. HKUST is also ranked first in the Asian university rankings. Malaysia is the regional trendsetter, having set out its stall as early as the mid-90s. In 1995 the Malaysian government, faced with the fact that 20% of its students left the country and went abroad to study at huge cost to Malaysian families and the Malaysian economy, decided to put all its efforts into reversing this trend.  Since then they have set about building up their network of universities in a bid to keep Malay students at home and attract foreign students into the country. In 2009 alone Malaysia increased its intake of foreign students by 26%, taking in 69,154 international students. By 2011 that had increased to more than 93,000. The target is to reach 150,000 by 2015. Living in south-east Asia and Hong Kong today means witnessing first hand the rise of China and the coming of the new world order \u2013 and for some that&apos;s more of an incentive than any enhancement to pay and conditions. But academics who help expand higher education in the region will also be improving the lives of thousands of young people with new found access to tertiary education."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/16/west-crisis-democracy-finance-spirit-dictators", "publicationDate": "2013-01-16T18:22:49Z", "tags": ["Slovenia", "Europe", "Eurozone crisis", "European Union", "Economics", "Financial crisis", "Business", "World news"], "sentences": ["If developing countries are &quot;prematurely democratised&quot;, the result is a populism that ends in economic catastrophe and political despotism \u2013 no wonder that today&apos;s economically most successful third world countries (Taiwan, South Korea, Chile) embraced full democracy only after a period of authoritarian rule."], "title": "The west's crisis is one of democracy as much as finance | Slavoj \u017di\u017eek", "article": "In one of the last interviews before his fall, Nicolae Ceausescu was asked by a western journalist how he justified the fact that Romanian citizens could not travel freely abroad although freedom of movement was guaranteed by the constitution. His answer was in the best tradition of Stalinist sophistry: true, the constitution guarantees freedom of movement, but it also guarantees the right to a safe, prosperous home. So we have here a potential conflict of rights: if Romanian citizens were to be allowed to leave the country, the prosperity of their homeland would be threatened. In this conflict, one has to make a choice, and the right to a prosperous, safe homeland enjoys clear priority \u2026 It seems that this same spirit is alive and well in Slovenia today. Last month the constitutional court found that a referendum on legislation to set up a &quot;bad bank&quot; and a sovereign holding would be unconstitutional \u2013 in effect banning a popular vote on the matter. The referendum was proposed by trade unions challenging the government&apos;s neoliberal economic politics, and the proposal got enough signatures to make it obligatory. The idea of the &quot;bad bank&quot; was of a place to transfer all bad credit from main banks, which would then be salvaged by state money (ie at taxpayers&apos; expense), so preventing any serious inquiry into who was responsible for this bad credit in the first place. This measure, debated for months, was far from being generally accepted, even by financial specialists. So why prohibit the referendum? In 2011, when George Papandreou&apos;s government in Greece proposed a referendum on austerity measures, there was panic in Brussels, but even there no one dared to directly prohibit it. According to the Slovenian constitutional court, the referendum &quot;would have caused unconstitutional consequences&quot;. How? The court conceded a constitutional right to a referendum, but claimed that its execution would endanger other constitutional values that should be given priority in an economic crisis: the efficient functioning of the state apparatus, especially in creating conditions for economic growth; the realisation of human rights, especially the rights to social security and to free economic initiative. In short, in assessing the consequences of the referendum, the court simply accepted as fact that failing to obey the dictates of international financial institutions (or to meet their expectations) can lead to political and economic crisis, and is thus unconstitutional. To put it bluntly: since meeting these dictates and expectations is the condition of maintaining the constitutional order, they have priority over the constitution (and eo ipso state sovereignty). Slovenia may be a small country, but this decision is a symptom of a global tendency towards the limitation of democracy. The idea is that, in a complex economic situation like today&apos;s, the majority of the people are not qualified to decide \u2013 they are unaware of the catastrophic consequences that would ensue if their demands were to be met. This line of argument is not new. In a TV interview a couple of years ago, the sociologist Ralf Dahrendorf linked the growing distrust for democracy to the fact that, after every revolutionary change, the road to new prosperity leads through a &quot;valley of tears&quot;. After the breakdown of socialism, one cannot directly pass to the abundance of a successful market economy: limited, but real, socialist welfare and security have to be dismantled, and these first steps are necessarily painful. The same goes for western Europe, where the passage from the post-second world war welfare state to new global economy involves painful renunciations, less security, less guaranteed social care. For Dahrendorf, the problem is encapsulated by the simple fact that this painful passage through the &quot;valley of tears&quot; lasts longer than the average period between elections, so that the temptation is great to postpone the difficult changes for the short-term electoral gains. For him, the paradigm here is the disappointment of the large strata of post-communist nations with the economic results of the new democratic order: in the glorious days of 1989, they equated democracy with the abundance of western consumerist societies; and 20 years later, with the abundance still missing, they now blame democracy itself. Unfortunately, Dahrendorf focuses much less on the opposite temptation: if the majority resist the necessary structural changes in the economy, would one of the logical conclusions not be that, for a decade or so, an enlightened elite should take power, even by non-democratic means, to enforce the necessary measures and thus lay the foundations for truly stable democracy? Along these lines, the journalist Fareed Zakaria pointed out how democracy can only &quot;catch on&quot; in economically developed countries. If developing countries are &quot;prematurely democratised&quot;, the result is a populism that ends in economic catastrophe and political despotism \u2013 no wonder that today&apos;s economically most successful third world countries (Taiwan, South Korea, Chile) embraced full democracy only after a period of authoritarian rule. And, furthermore, does this line of thinking not provide the best argument for the authoritarian regime in China? What is new today is that, with the financial crisis that began in 2008, this same distrust of democracy \u2013 once constrained to the third world or post-communist developing countries \u2013 is gaining ground in the developed west itself: what was a decade or two ago patronising advice to others now concerns ourselves. The least one can say is that this crisis offers proof that it is not the people but experts themselves who do not know what they are doing. In western Europe we are effectively witnessing a growing inability of the ruling elite \u2013 they know less and less how to rule. Look at how Europe is dealing with the Greek crisis: putting pressure on Greece to repay debts, but at the same time ruining its economy through imposed austerity measures and thereby making sure that the Greek debt will never be repaid. At the end of October last year, the IMF itself released research showing that the economic damage from aggressive austerity measures may be as much as three times larger than previously assumed, thereby nullifying its own advice on austerity in the eurozone crisis. Now the IMF admits that forcing Greece and other debt-burdened countries to reduce their deficits too quickly would be counterproductive, but only after hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost because of such &quot;miscalculations&quot;. And therein resides the true message of the &quot;irrational&quot; popular protests all around Europe: the protesters know very well what they don&apos;t know; they don&apos;t pretend to have fast and easy answers; but what their instinct is telling them is nonetheless true \u2013 that those in power also don&apos;t know it. In Europe today, the blind are leading the blind."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jan/21/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2013-01-21T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google", "Aaron Swartz"], "sentences": ["Google happy to see Acer, Asustek launch inexpensive tablets to hike Android penetration, say Taiwan makers &gt;&gt; Digitimes  As Acer and Asustek Computer will soon launch 7-inch tablets for sale at about US$149, Google, although having cooperated with Asustek to develop the Nexus 7, is not worried about the competitive impact of US$149 tablets on sales and instead hopes the launches will increase the global market share of Android tablets, according to supply chain makers."], "title": "Boot up: Google v Android (yes), Swartz v pleas, where musicians make money, and more", "article": "A quick burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Red October attackers shutting down C&amp;C infrastructure &gt;&gt; threatpost  It appears that the attackers behind the Red October cyberespionage campaign are taking their ball and going home.

But none of these rights matter if the defendant never gets to trial. And thanks to the legal fiction that plea bargaining is a voluntary negotiation between the prosecutor and defendant, our justice system effectively gives people dramatically longer sentences for exercising the right to have a trial at all.  Thanks in part to this kind of coercion, more than 90 percent of defendants waive their right to a jury trial. For the majority of defendants, then, the plea bargaining process is the justice system. As a result, prosecutors wield an immense amount of power with very little accountability.  What does Google need from Android? &gt;&gt; Benedict Evans  [With Google Now,] Google is giving you useful titbits, but it is also mining far more data than it would get from a PC user - data to improve search relevance and advertising relevance.  In other words, Android, like Plus, allows Google to tie searches and advertising to individual people and places. In the long term, the data that Google gets from Android users is probably just as important as Pagerank in understanding intent and relevance in search.   Hence, the real structural benefit to Google from Android now comes from the understanding it gives of actual users, and the threat comes from devices that do not provide this data - even if, like the iPhone, they do provide plenty of search traffic.   Obviously, Google&apos;s access to this data on non-Android platforms is pretty partial, but the problem also applies to significant parts of the Android base. In China the problem is near-absolute. Google services are mostly blocked anyway, almost all Android phones ship with no Google services installed (i.e. they are based on the open source AOSP version of Android) and hence Google gets close to zero practical benefit from the explosive growth of Android there...  To put that another way, Google&apos;s penetration of Android is as important as Android&apos;s penetration of the handset market.

Tensions over the island chain \u2013 known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China \u2013 have escalated since Japan bought the islands from private owners. Chinese ships returned to waters around the disputed islands on Monday, the Japanese coastguard said, for the 24th time since the row broke out. Japan&apos;s defence minister has refused to rule out the use of warning shots to deter Chinese aircraft from flying nearby, a move that would raise the stakes. This month China scrambled fighter jets to tail Japanese fighters that were shadowing a Chinese surveillance plane. The row is shaded by broader concerns: neighbours are anxious about an increasingly powerful China, while China fears the US is seeking to contain it. Beijing hit out at Washington after Clinton said that while the US did not take a position on the sovereignty of the chain, it opposed &quot;any unilateral actions that would seek to undermine Japanese administration&quot;. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a briefing on Monday that the outgoing US secretary of state&apos;s comments were &quot;ignorant of facts and indiscriminate of rights and wrongs&quot;, echoing a statement issued the previous day. He said the US \u2013 which controlled the islands from 1945 to 1972 before returning them to Japan \u2013 had &quot;undeniable historical responsibility&quot; in the dispute. Taiwan also claims sovereignty over the chain. Professor Huang Jing, an expert on regional security at the National University of Singapore, said US credibility in the Asia-Pacific region was at stake and Washington needed to show leadership by convincing both sides to negotiate. &quot;In public it&apos;s China versus the US. In private I think it&apos;s more difficult to convince not China, but Japan. There&apos;s too much at stake for the Japanese leadership,&quot; he said. &quot;I think there&apos;s still a fine line neither side is trying to cross,&quot; he added, pointing out that Japanese patrols had not forced Chinese vessels from the area, while China had kept military ships away. But he said: &quot;Political survival on both sides is more important than avoiding a skirmish or even war.&quot; The countries could take a step back as long as peace endured, but it would be far harder &quot;to catch up or patch up after something happens&quot;, Huang said. Shogo Suzuki, an expert on Sino-Japanese relations and visiting associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, said: &quot;All it takes is one hothead to pull the trigger and the whole thing spirals out of control. It&apos;s a dangerous situation and I think both sides have trapped themselves.&quot; The recent aerial standoff ended without incident, but the proximity of Chinese to Japanese fighters heightens the risk of an accident or pilot error leading to a wider conflict between Asia&apos;s two biggest economies. Tokyo is considering stationing a fleet of fighter jets closer to the islands. The defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, suggested that Japanese pilots could use tracer fire to warn Chinese fighters that their presence had been noted and that further action could follow. &quot;Every country has procedures for how to deal with a violation of its territory that continues after multiple cautionary measures,&quot; Onodera said. &quot;We have response measures ready that are consistent with global standards.&quot; Chinese officials said the use of tracer fire would not go unanswered, and accused Japan of deliberately raising tensions. Chinese media have stressed the need to improve military preparedness, though without making direct reference to the territorial row. Some observers see possible hints of a thaw, such as reports that Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has asked a coalition partner, Natsuo Yamaguchi of the New Komeito party, to bear a personal message to Chinese leaders in a visit that begins on Tuesday. Suzuki said Abe&apos;s hawkish credentials should protect him from charges of being weak on China, potentially allowing him to take the initiative. But Huang Dahui, director of the centre for East Asian studies at Renmin University in Beijing, argued Abe had already toughened Tokyo&apos;s stance. &quot;Japan has intensified the relationship with the US to suppress China, and has made efforts to rope in other South Asian countries which also have territorial problems with China, such as India, and other countries which have different values from China. They are trying to build a network against China,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/22/elderly-hurry-up-die-japanese", "publicationDate": "2013-01-22T08:42:19Z", "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["He once likened an opposition party to the Nazis, praised Japan&apos;s colonial rule in Taiwan and, as foreign minister, told US diplomats they would never be trusted in Middle East peace negotiations because they have &quot;blue eyes and blond hair&quot;."], "title": "Let elderly people 'hurry up and die', says Japanese minister", "article": "Japan&apos;s new government is barely a month old, and already one of its most senior members has insulted tens of millions of voters by suggesting that the elderly are an unnecessary drain on the country&apos;s finances. Taro Aso, the finance minister, said on Monday that the elderly should be allowed to &quot;hurry up and die&quot; to relieve pressure on the state to pay for their medical care. &quot;Heaven forbid if you are forced to live on when you want to die. I would wake up feeling increasingly bad knowing that [treatment] was all being paid for by the government,&quot; he said during a meeting of the national council on social security reforms. &quot;The problem won&apos;t be solved unless you let them hurry up and die.&quot; Aso&apos;s comments are likely to cause offence in Japan, where almost a quarter of the 128 million population is aged over 60. The proportion is forecast to rise to 40% over the next 50 years. The remarks are also an unwelcome distraction for the new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, whose first period as Japan&apos;s leader ended with his resignation after just a year, in 2007, partly due to a string of gaffes by members of his cabinet. Rising welfare costs, particularly for the elderly, were behind a decision last year to double consumption [sales] tax to 10% over the next three years, a move Aso&apos;s Liberal Democratic party supported. The 72-year-old, who doubles as deputy prime minister, said he would refuse end-of-life care. &quot;I don&apos;t need that kind of care,&quot; he said in comments quoted by local media, adding that he had written a note instructing his family to deny him life-prolonging medical treatment. To compound the insult, he referred to elderly patients who are no longer able to feed themselves as &quot;tube people&quot;. The health and welfare ministry, he added, was &quot;well aware that it costs several tens of millions of yen&quot; a month to treat a single patient in the final stages of life. Cost aside, caring for the elderly is a major challenge for Japan&apos;s stretched social services. According to a report this week, the number of households receiving welfare, which include family members aged 65 or over, stood at more than 678,000, or about 40% of the total. The country is also tackling a rise in the number of people who die alone, most of whom are elderly. In 2010, 4.6 million elderly people lived alone, and the number who died at home soared 61% between 2003 and 2010, from 1,364 to 2,194, according to the bureau of social welfare and public health in Tokyo. The government is planning to reduce welfare expenditure in its next budget, due to go into force this April, with details of the cuts expected within days. Aso, who has a propensity for verbal blunders, later attempted to clarify his comments. He acknowledged his language had been &quot;inappropriate&quot; in a public forum and insisted he was talking only about his personal preference. &quot;I said what I personally believe, not what the end-of-life medical care system should be,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;It is important that you be able spend the final days of your life peacefully.&quot; It is not the first time Aso, one of Japan&apos;s wealthiest politicians, has questioned the state&apos;s duty towards its large elderly population. In 2008, while serving as prime minister, he described &quot;doddering&quot; pensioners as tax burdens who should take better care of their health. &quot;I see people aged 67 or 68 at class reunions who dodder around and are constantly going to the doctor,&quot; he said at a meeting of economists. &quot;Why should I have to pay for people who just eat and drink and make no effort? I walk every day and do other things, but I&apos;m paying more in taxes.&quot; He had already angered the country&apos;s doctors by telling them they lacked common sense, made a joke about Alzheimer&apos;s patients, and pronounced &quot;penniless young men&quot; unfit for marriage. In 2001, he said he wanted Japan to become the kind of successful country in which &quot;the richest Jews would want to live&quot;. He once likened an opposition party to the Nazis, praised Japan&apos;s colonial rule in Taiwan and, as foreign minister, told US diplomats they would never be trusted in Middle East peace negotiations because they have &quot;blue eyes and blond hair&quot;. While figures released on Monday showed a record 2.14 million Japanese were receiving welfare in October 2012, Aso has led a life of privilege few of his compatriots could hope to match. He is the grandson of Shigeru Yoshida, an influential postwar prime minister, and is married to the daughter of another former premier. While campaigning for the premiership in 2008, Aso refused to acknowledge the use of hundreds of allied prisoners of war by his family&apos;s coal mining business during the second world war.

For it was at Manchester University \u2013 on one side of the statue and its bench in Sackville Park while the city&apos;s Gay Village is on the other \u2013 that the computer pioneer took the first groundbreaking steps towards today&apos;s &apos;artificial intelligence&apos;, bequeathing us the Turing Test for intelligence in machines. It was also in Manchester that the World War II code-breaker was convicted in 1952 for having gay sex, subjected to state-enforced chemical castration and committed suicide two years later. What a contrast that the Olympic relay, which Turing would have enjoyed as a marathon runner himself, came here to honour him. All year, he was at the centre of commemorations in more than 40 countries, from Norway to Colombia and from the Philippines to Canada. Designated as Alan Turing Year, 2012 saw an unprecedented level of interest in the man and his work, with public events, TV films, exhibitions and conferences big and small. Channel 4 showed the acclaimed film Britain&apos;s Greatest Codebreaker - now edited and touring internationally as Codebreaker - and London&apos;s Science Museum staged an exhibition called Codebreaker: Alan Turing&apos;s Life and Legacy.     Still tryable online: Google's Doodle tribute to the great man. Photograph: Google    Bletchley Park, with support from Google (which also did a fine doodle to mark the centenary), marketed an Alan Turing Monopoly set in time for Christmas stockings. Twitter was abuzz with Turingtalk and the Turing Year page drew followers from Lady Gaga&apos;s Born This Way Foundation to Gordon Brown&apos;s wife Sarah. The Pet Shop Boys got together with the BBC Philharmonic to perform a Turing-inspired composition. My own hectic Turing year, apart from many events in the UK, took in talks as far afield as New Zealand, Switzerland, China and Hong Kong, Taiwan, Greece, Hungary, Slovakia, the USA, Mexico and Brazil. More than simply amazing, the whole great enterprise fitted brilliantly with the focus on British science, innovation, and eccentricity which was so engagingly lauded in the Olympic opening and closing ceremonies.  The Foreign Secretary, William Hague, paid tribute to Turing at Bletchley Park, and the head of GCHQ Iain Lobban spoke publicly in Leeds, about Turing as a  &quot;Founder of the Information Age&quot; whose work influenced everything from washing machines to smart phones.  I could even post my letters with an Alan Turing commemorative stamp.  But here we meet a truly Alice-In-Wonderland mismatch between Establishment self-serving and individual genius. The details of Alan Turing&apos;s conviction for &apos;a homosexual act&apos; - the sort of human rights violation for which we nowadays condemn other countries - can be easily found on the web or in the centenary edition of Andrew Hodges&apos; biography of Turing, as can evidence of his subsequent anguish. It was not only the enforced medication which affected and in the end destroyed this great scientist; the public humiliation also played its part. In 1952 Alan wrote to his friend Norman Routledge:  Turing believes machines think. Turing lies with men. Therefore machines do not think.   The injustice remains. But in 2012 it was Manchester more than any other city that took Alan Turing to its heart, honouring him with particular creativity, enthusiasm and sheer affection. There was bubbling local pride in the fact that the first &apos;real&apos; computer in the world, the &apos;Manchester baby&apos; was Mancunian; and that the first computer chess programme was run in the city by Turing&apos;s friend Dietrich Prinz, who had previously been a student of Albert Einstein in Berlin. Much of this early history has been brought to life at the city&apos;s Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI); and during the year that came complete with an Alan Turing actor mingling with visitors.      Runners honour a runner. The Olympic flame at Turing's statue in Manchester.    MOSI and the Manchester Museum also stretched our minds with Turing&apos;s explanations of patterns in nature: embroidering Rudyard Kipling&apos;s &apos;How the Leopard Got Its Spots&apos; with super-clever mathematics of morphogenesis explaining moving stripes on tropical fish and giving computer simulations of emergent dappling of cows&apos; backs. Professor Bernard Richards, who worked with Turing in this area, gave talks, and was presented with an award by the Queen for his contribution of a morphogenesis memento for a 2012 time capsule. Most excitingly for countless school children was the Turing&apos;s Sunflowers experiment from MOSI and the Manchester Science Festival, getting them counting whorls on sunflower heads to verify Turing&apos;s ideas about the link to &apos;Fibonacci numbers&apos;.  Computer science, whose origins go back to Turing&apos;s 1936 discovery of the Universal Turing Machine, was treated to a magnificent international conference at Manchester town hall, with chess celebrity Garry Kasparov winning against Turing&apos;s early computer chess program. During the meeting, the Olympic flame reappeared outside.  The Alan Turing Cryptography Competition for schools run by Manchester University, was so popular that it is being repeated as I write. And perhaps the leading contender for greatest fun was 2012 Manchester Pride, braving the complications of science with a whole week dedicated to Turing and his record as an openly gay man in early 1950s Britain. It showed how he was before his time socially, as well as in science.     The lonelieness of the long distance runner. Turing competing at school.     Turing&apos;s vision underlies the overarching edifice that is today&apos;s computer age. Writer George Dyson calls this awesome memorial Turing&apos;s Cathedral, the title of his centenary book about the digital world and its origins. We have a virtual memorial to Turing in the form of the informational age that structures our everyday lives but we still sadly have no physical memorial to the scientist in London. In his review of Dyson&apos;s book, Peter Forbes comments:  Britain&apos;s societal failings are still painfully on show in the Establishment&apos;s cack-handed efforts to make amends for the persecution Turing suffered.   Gordon Brown made a heartfelt apology in 2009; in 2012 Lord Sharkey called in the Lords for a pardon, and MP John Leech&apos;s Commons early day motion attracted 28 signatures from across all the main parties. But the world still awaits a formal rebuttal of the historic injustice.  Today&apos;s Cabinet, with no science graduate (the Minister for Universities and Science did politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford) is symptomatic of a historic lack of understanding of and support for the unique scientific achievements of the UK. Our national capital has no memorial to Alan Turing comparable to Manchester&apos;s. The government&apos;s refusal to grant him a pardon during the centenary year leaves instead a misguided conviction under a misguided law and an Establishment that didn&apos;t get it and still doesn&apos;t.  But it was a wonderful year and countless people gave time and energy to make that the case. Turing changed our world, and 2012 has made us all a bit more aware of how that happened - and of what may be coming next. Professor S. Barry Cooper is a mathematician at the University of Leeds.

Apple&apos;s quarterly earnings, just announced, have been the subject of speculation reaching into hysteria and chicanery. For any other company, the results would have been excellent, even stellar: revenues of $54.5bn, an 18% increase over the same quarter last year, and profits of $13.1bn. While profits were flat relative to the prior year, the same quarter in 2011 had 14 weeks, as opposed to 13 weeks in 2012, so results were actually better. Still, investors were very disappointed \u2013 including myself. My own disappointment, however, is not principally financial, in the narrow sense. Rather, what bothers me is that Apple&apos;s financial shortfall comes from a clear refusal to recognize some very important realities. What does this mean for Apple&apos;s prospects? The company&apos;s future depends upon three very large, very separate questions: the size of its market opportunity; its implementation competence; and its large-scale strategic position. The first question is often posed very skeptically: can a company this large continue to grow rapidly? Many observers assert that this simply isn&apos;t possible, and that Apple&apos;s markets must soon reach saturation. They&apos;re wrong. I realize that it is hard to believe, but in fact, Apple has enormous room to grow: it could reach $500bn (or more) in revenues quite easily, and rather soon. Even Apple&apos;s existing markets \u2013 primarily, phones and tablets \u2013 are still only in the earliest stages of evolution. Only perhaps one third of the world&apos;s mobile phone users have ever owned a smartphone, and most of the installed base of smartphones is, or will soon be, entirely obsolete. Twenty years from now, a smartphone with a fast broadband connection will be a necessity of life, replacing your keys, credit cards, identification, remote controls, cameras, GPS, and much else. These phones will also be far less expensive than today, and everyone will have one. Much the same will be true of tablets: if, as I and many others believe, tablets become as ubiquitous as the objects we still quaintly call &quot;personal computers&quot;, then we&apos;re going to buy another billion of them, and then replace them a few times after that. And then, there&apos;s also a billion televisions \u2013 if Apple enters that market \u2013 not to mention cloud services, watches and glasses and heads-up car displays and games and household control systems and personal robots \u2026 and five more things I can&apos;t think of right now. Twenty years from now, there will be consumer-usable, internet-connected stuff everywhere. I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll like that world, but I&apos;m certain that it will be there. But just because Apple could become by far the largest and most profitable company in the history of the world, dwarfing even Exxon, does not mean that it will become that company. Apple faces two major challenges: its ability to execute, and its large-scale, high level, strategic position. As to the first \u2013 implementation capacity \u2013 I am rather sanguine. It is increasingly clear that, for better and/or worse, modern information technology makes it possible to manage organizations of extraordinary size and scope. Hon Tai Precision Industries (aka Foxconn), the Taiwan-headquartered company that is Apple&apos;s largest contract manufacturer, already has well over 1 million employees. Apple still has less than 100,000 employees, and half of those are in its stores, which are, by far, the most profitable retail operations in the world. Most of Apple&apos;s operational metrics are outstanding: revenue per employee, etc. And whatever problems Apple has \u2013 I&apos;ll give you my list in a moment \u2013 I don&apos;t think that managerial competence is among them (at least, in the narrow sense). I listen to Apple&apos;s quarterly conference calls, and Tim Cook is one smart cookie. But now we come, literally, to the $1tn question, about which I&apos;m becoming highly skeptical. Apple is enmeshed in the highest-stakes strategic contest in economic history \u2013 one that makes the battle for control of the personal computer market, won by Microsoft and Intel three decades ago, seem nearly trivial. The new contest presently has three core participants \u2013 Apple, Google, and Samsung \u2013 and many secondary players. A few others, such as Amazon, aspire to first-tier status, whereas firms such as ARM, EBay, Netflix, and Square could dominate major specialized domains. It is an extraordinarily complex, nuanced strategic game, though one in which most of the large incumbents \u2013 Intel, Microsoft, PC manufacturers, RIM, Nokia, Japanese electronics companies \u2013 can be ignored. Indeed, I will argue (in a later column) that Microsoft is terminal: it has cancer, heart disease, strokes, and Alzheimer&apos;s, while also being shot, knifed, and poisoned by skilled assassins. It is so over. Google and Samsung, though, are a different story, and Apple is not doing everything right. To be sure, its products are gorgeous and cool and easy to use; it leaves manufacturing to others but is intimately knowledgeable about it; and Apple is highly disciplined about its architectures, so that it avoids the technical monstrosities that now cripple Microsoft. But Apple is making huge mistakes \u2013 which could destroy it over time unless it corrects itself. The first is its failure, or refusal, to address low-price markets. While Apple&apos;s products are cool, there are billions of human beings who can&apos;t afford to, or simply don&apos;t, care about cool. Apple is dismissing those human beings, their needs, and the market they represent because they have the bad taste to be poor. That is arrogant, and in this case, it&apos;s also stupid. Relatedly, Apple still refuses to distribute important elements of its technology on rival platforms, which prevents it from ever being able to offer ubiquitous, standardized inter-operability. Apple is in a war for platform control, and low-cost Android devices are dangerously close to setting standards, even on Apple&apos;s own devices (for exampe, Google maps, Google docs). And finally, Apple&apos;s obsessive secrecy, and the insularity that inevitably comes with such secrecy, is also a huge mistake. Long ago, I worked for IBM when it behaved similarly, and IBM&apos;s cult of secrecy contributed mightily to concealment and avoidance of unpleasant facts. If you don&apos;t talk to people, they don&apos;t talk to you; and then you don&apos;t learn. Apple&apos;s underperformance this quarter is a symptom of these problems, rather than simply a matter of component prices or gross margins. Let&apos;s hope that they figure that out, because they still do some very cool stuff. I&apos;d like to hold on to my stock, too. But unless Apple changes, I don&apos;t think I should."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jan/24/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2013-01-24T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google", "Phablets"], "sentences": ["Taiwan 4Q12 digital camera shipments hit 15-quarter low &gt;&gt; Digitimes Research  Taiwan-based Ability Enterprise, Altek, Foxconn Electronics and Asia Optical shipped 7.588m digital cameras in total during the fourth quarter of 2012, hitting the lowest quarterly level since the second quarter of 2009, according to Digitimes Research."], "title": "Boot up: convertibles compared, working with Jobs, Facebook Graph searches and more", "article": "A quick burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team The Convertible PCs &gt;&gt; WSJ.com Walt Mossberg tries out the HP Envy x2, Asus Taichi 21 and Toshiba Satellite U925t.

What it was really like working with Steve Jobs &gt;&gt; Inventor Labs Blog Glenn Reid:   I was recruited by Steve&apos;s right hand man to come in to build iMovie 1.0, in large part because I knew a lot about NeXTSTEP, the technology which was to become MacOS X, and because I think Steve liked PasteUp and liked me and thought I could get it done (we were done ahead of schedule, as it turned out).  I can still remember some of those early meetings, with 3 or 4 of us in a locked room somewhere on Apple campus, with a lot of whiteboards, talking about what iMovie should be (and should not be). It was as pure as pure gets, in terms of building software. Steve would draw a quick vision on the whiteboard, we&apos;d go work on it for a while, bring it back, find out the ways in which it sucked, and we&apos;d iterate, again and again and again. That&apos;s how it always went. Iteration. It&apos;s the key to design, really. Just keep improving it until you have to ship it.  There were only 3 of us on the team, growing to 4 within the year, with no marketing and very little infrastructure around us. There was paper over the internal windows to keep other Apple employees from knowing what we were doing.   iMovie 1.0 really was an amazing product. How many people does the average startup now have coding products that are far less innovative? June 2010: Android 2.1 powered Huawei S7 tablet works as 7-Inch phone &gt;&gt; Android Guys Scott Webster in June 2010:   If there is one thing Android has certainly become very good at, it&apos;s blurring the line between tablet and smart phone. Where exactly does one decide to stop calling something a phone? Is it five inches? How about 5.5-inches? What if the device was 7-inches and still had the ability to make and receive calls? I would like to go ahead and take the initiative to coin a new term, &quot;phablet&quot;.   Emphasis added. Blame or praise Webster for coining the word, unless you can find an earlier use of the word. (Via @phonewisdom on Twitter.)

People yearn to be individuals. They want to be authentic. They have numerous different groups of real-life friends. They stylize conversations. They are emotional and have an innate need to connect on different levels with different people. This is because humans are born with an instinctual desire to understand the broader context of their surroundings and build rapport, a social awareness often called emotional intelligence.

Android is popular because it&apos;s cheap, not because it&apos;s good &gt;&gt; Gizmodo Sam Biddle:   Phones like the Nexus 4 and Galaxy SIII are tremendous as both pieces of hardware and containers for smart, thoughtful software. Each is a pleasure to use, but that&apos;s not Android&apos;s sharpest knife.  Android&apos;s success isn&apos;t really about these phones. It&apos;s about the ZTE Warp, LG Motion, and Samsung Captivate--which retail for $100, $50, and a penny, respectively. It&apos;s about these marginal, middling phones that can be sold like bags of Doritos or bargain-bin sweaters--they&apos;re priced to move, not priced to be ogled at or aspired towards. And it&apos;s working.  The last study conducted by the Pew Research Center&apos;s Internet &amp; American Life Project shows that Android is the chosen smartphone of people without money. Among respondents, 22% of those with annual incomes below $30,000 were Android owners, as opposed to just 12% for iPhone. With those towards the lower-middle class, the trend holds: Android owns 23% of incomes up to $50,000, with iPhones at 18%. The data makes it clear: the less money you have, the more likely you are to opt for an Android phone over something more expensive.

Did you do research trips there? What did you think about it as a country? I went to Saudi Arabia in 2010, and spent most of my time in Jeddah and the King Abdullah Economic City. Before I went, I&apos;d talked to friends who visited the kingdom, and some who&apos;d lived there, so I had some sense of what to expect. But when I got there, what struck me more than anything was how quickly it&apos;s changing. The internet arrived about 10 years ago, and more and more people have access to satellite TV, and now the youth of Saudi are insisting on change. And under King Abdullah, there&apos;s been movement on many fronts. The King Abdullah University of Science and Technology is one example \u2014 women and men mix more freely there \u2013 and the arts in general are far more accepted and even liberated than ever before. I did a forum recently with three young Saudi artists, including Haifaa Al-Mansour, the first feature-film director from the kingdom, and all three were optimistic about where things are headed. In 10 more years, I think we&apos;ll see some profound reforms. \u00a0 The &quot;hologram&quot; of the title seems to refer not only to a new kind of IT technology but to the idea that the systems of modern finance were built on a mirage. Do you think capitalism has been shown wanting? Did we lose something tangible and real during those years we believed in endless credit? There&apos;s also the hologram of Alan&apos;s life. He&apos;s been raised to expect that, as an American businessman, he&apos;ll be given a certain kind of regal treatment abroad, but finds that things have changed. He&apos;s on the sidelines now, and has no idea how to get back into the game. And at home, the American Dream that was promised to guys like Alan seems increasingly unavailable. The financial system, the banks, the venture capitalists \u2014\u00a0these players don&apos;t have use for a guy like Alan. \u00a0 Your prose in Hologram is sparse; so subtle it creeps up on you. How much do you work on your prose style? Do you need to keep reminding yourself to strip it back? Getting the tone just right for Hologram took a while. I&apos;m naturally inclined toward a more dense, maximalist style, but that wouldn&apos;t have been right for this book, and for Alan&apos;s story. He&apos;s a middle-aged man stuck in a desert, so the prose had to be spare and exact. \u00a0 Did you consciously set out to write a novel about the global financial crisis? I&apos;d been taking notes for a few years for a novel about a man who&apos;d been in manufacturing, but found himself adrift when his industry moved to Taiwan and China. I grew up north of Chicago, not far from where the Schwinn bicycle plant used to be, and was conscious of the fact that these beautiful, everlasting bikes were made just down the road. When the plant closed, psychically it was a big blow to Chicago, and ever since, there&apos;s been very little manufacturing done in or near the city. And that&apos;s very strange, given how central industry had been to the city&apos;s identity since the beginning. So I&apos;d been thinking about this guy, Alan Clay, who he was and where he was in his life, and then one day I heard about the King Abdullah Economic City, and about American businessmen waiting in the desert for an audience with the king. That seemed the perfect\u00a0place for Alan, for a guy who knows he&apos;s in trouble but doesn&apos;t know how to find his way out. So he travels thousands of miles, to a desert, to wait for the approval of a despot. I liked that; it has a strong parallel to our own economy. The American economy had a lot of problems, and for the solutions\u00a0we tend to look everywhere but the mirror. \u00a0 Is it true you write without the distraction of the internet? Do you think the internet helps or hinders thought processes? I&apos;ve never had WiFi at home. I&apos;m too easily distracted, and YouTube is too tempting. About eight years ago, I had a DSL line for about three months, and I remember waking up one day, thinking I&apos;d spend a few minutes on YouTube before getting to work. Next time I looked up, it was 1pm, and I was watching a 20-year-old video by Kajagoogoo. That proved that I couldn&apos;t have WiFi at home. \u00a0 You&apos;re married to a writer. Do you show her your work as you&apos;re writing it? I do. Periodically I&apos;ll ask Vendela [Vida] to look at something, to make sure I&apos;m not wasting my time. \u00a0 The book shows both a man and a global system in stasis. How much of this was influenced by your own impending middle age? Impending nothing. I&apos;m 42, which is middle age in my world. The last couple days, actually, I&apos;ve had this feeling that my ribs are broken, all of them. It hurts to walk, to breathe. I can&apos;t figure that out. Could I have broken all my ribs while sleeping or sitting on the couch? I need to figure this out. A Hologram for the King is a beautiful physical object: how important is it for you that a book is a thing to be cherished? McSweeney&apos;s as a publishing company is built on a business model that only works when we sell physical books. So we try to put a lot of effort into the design and production of the book-as-object. For Hologram, we worked with a great printer near Detroit, and that collaboration proved, on a small level, that you can make manufacturing work here in the States if you&apos;re willing to work within the capabilities of existing machinery and expertise \u2014 and the occasional constraints can actually make the object better. Besides, the manufacturing costs in China, when you consider time and shipping, make Detroit more logical much of the time. You founded one of the most influential literary magazines in the US. Do you feel pessimistic about the future of publishing? There&apos;s never been a better time, I don&apos;t think, to be a writer or publisher. The playing field is more democratic than ever, in that any small publisher can get a book to any reader in the world with relative ease. That&apos;s very new, and good for everyone. I&apos;m also encouraged because it looks like ebooks&apos; share of the market might be levelling out. I always hoped there&apos;d be a plateau, and after that, ebooks and physical books would enjoy a kind of permanent d\u00e9tente. At least for the moment, that seems to be what&apos;s happening. Do you own a Kindle? I don&apos;t. I&apos;ve never read a page on an e-reader. But I have no problem with them as another path to the text. But for me, because I write on a Mac, I spend so many hours looking at a screen already, so when I want to read a book or a newspaper, I like the paper in my hands \u2013 for contrast as much as anything. You&apos;re the founder of 826 Valencia and have done a lot of human rights and charity work over the years. Should authors have a moral conscience? I don&apos;t know if authors should as a rule do anything but try to write well. But sitting in your garage, writing \u2013\u00a0or pretending to write, while actually watching Kajagoogoo videos \u2013\u00a0sometimes it makes you feel a little useless. Sometimes you feel like getting out in the world and seeing if you can be useful in some more immediate or tangible way. With our nonprofits, they all emerged from situations where it just seemed logical. I knew teachers, and I knew writers with free time on their hands, so it made sense to create a centre where we could help schools with one-on-one attention to student writing. That idea works everywhere, and in London it works with the Ministry of Stories (cofounded by Nick Hornby) and First Story. You&apos;ve experienced the shocking and sudden deaths of close family members: are you scared of death? Well, there&apos;s a familiarity now that precludes fear. Why did you choose to do this interview over email? My hope is that I sound smarter and more focused this way. In person I tend to ramble. You&apos;re famed for blending fact and fiction: how difficult is that to pull off? Do you find facts liberating or restricting? These days, I don&apos;t have any nonfiction planned. Writing fiction is far more liberating and enjoyable on a daily basis. But I came up as a journalist, and my education was as a journalist, so research, and trying to tell a story that might have an impact \u2013\u00a0those things will likely always be part of the mix. President Obama recommended his cabinet read What Is the What. Have you ever met the president and, if so, what was he like? I met him briefly, during the campaign, back in 2008. There was a small fundraiser in Berkeley, and we all got to spend a few minutes with him. I&apos;ve met some other elected leaders over the years, and almost uniformly there&apos;s a stiffness about them, a certain distance \u2014 even if they&apos;re known for their charm. But Obama has a realness about him that&apos;s not fakeable. He is exactly who he appears to be. I don&apos;t have to tell anyone from London what a bonehead Romney is, but outside of being a verbal klutz, he was the most unknowable, and mercurial, and utterly dangerous, politician since Nixon. With President Obama, you know who he is morning, noon and night. That kind of certainty, and moral clarity, is essential to a country trying to find its footing again. What is the best book you read last year? There are a bunch of books I could mention, but the book I find myself pushing on people more than any other\u00a0is The Yellow Birds by Kevin Powers. The author fought in Iraq with the US army, and then, many years later, this gorgeous novel emerged. Next to The Forever War by Dexter Filkins, it&apos;s the best thing I&apos;ve read about the war in Iraq, and by far the best novel. Powers is a poet first, so the book is spare, incredibly precise, unimproveable. And it&apos;s easily the saddest book I&apos;ve read in many years. But sad in an important\u00a0way. We need to feel sad, profoundly sad, about what we did in Iraq. We deserve a hundred years of sadness."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jan/29/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2013-01-29T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google", "Acer"], "sentences": ["iMac shipments fall over 40% in 4Q12, say Taiwan makers &gt;&gt; Digitimes  There were an estimated 578,000 new iMacs shipped in the fourth quarter of 2012, dropping 42.8% on quarter and 54.8% on year mainly due to delayed supplies of key components, especially panels, according to Taiwan-based supply chain makers."], "title": "Boot up: Apple's next iPhone?, Phorm fizzles, Instagram v Vine, Acer on Chrome and more", "article": "A quick burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Beijing government releases official air quality monitoring app &gt;&gt; Tech In Asia  Boy, has the government come a long way when it comes to air pollution.

As we allocate larger and larger numbers for these IDs, the space required to store them must grow in turn. For example, we migrated Tweet IDs from 32-bit to 64-bit integers back in 2009, then did the same for direct message IDs in 2011. We expect to start allocating user IDs in a 64-bit integer space sometime this year.  This means that if you currently use signed 32-bit integers to track user IDs in your system, you should update your code to use 64-bit integers as soon as you can. To be safe, and to provide a date to aim for, we recommend making this change by July 1, 2013. This includes statically typed variables in your application code and column types in your database code.

Acer sees success in Chrome; Windows 8 fails to drive sales &gt;&gt; Bloomberg  Chrome-based models accounted for 5% to 10% of Acer&apos;s US shipments since being released there in November, President Jim Wong said in an interview at the Taipei-based company&apos;s headquarters. That ratio is expected to be sustainable in the long term and the company is considering offering Chrome models in other developed markets, he said.  Acer, which last week announced a NT$3.5bn ($120m) write-off on the value of its Gateway, Packard Bell and eMachines brands that pushed it into losses, is looking for alternatives as Windows-based computers struggle amid rising popularity of tablets and smartphones. Global computer industry shipments dropped 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter despite Microsoft&apos;s latest operating system being released during the period, according to IDC Corp.  &quot;Windows 8 itself is still not successful,&quot; said Wong, whose company posted a 28% drop in fourth-quarter shipments from a year earlier. &quot;The whole market didn&apos;t come back to growth after the Windows 8 launch, that&apos;s a simple way to judge if it is successful or not.&quot;   Also: won&apos;t release any Windows RT devices before autumn.

But a new study suggests that this type of tool may not be a panacea for dispelling inaccurate beliefs, particularly among people who already want to believe the falsehood.  &quot;Real-time corrections do have some positive effect, but it is mostly with people who were predisposed to reject the false claim anyway,&quot; said R. Kelly Garrett, lead author of the study and assistant professor of communication at Ohio State University....  In fact, it has already been attempted: A team from Intel and the University of California, Berkeley, developed Dispute Finder, a plug-in for web browsers that was released in 2009 and would alert users when they opened a webpage with a disputed claim.

Both take pride in inheriting the best ancient Chinese cultural practices, from drinking Oolong tea and practicing martial arts, to respecting elders. Commercially, more than 400 flights go between Taiwan and Hong Kong on a weekly basis, making the route one of the top 10 &quot;busiest commercial airline routes&quot; in the world in 2011. After the 2008 world financial crisis, both economies started to search for a new model of development, a model integrating innovation with broader social needs. The World Economic Forum (WEF) categorises both Taiwan and Hong Kong as economies that have reached the state of &quot;innovation-driven growth&quot;, the third stage of economic development. (Stage 1 of development is &quot;factor-driven development&quot;, and State 2 is &quot;efficiency-driven development&quot;). Hong Kong ranked No9 in WEF&apos;s Global Competitive Index with a score of 5.4, while Taiwan ranked No 13 with a score of 5.3. And yet, 9.2% of businesses in Taiwan and 16.2% in Hong Kong selected &quot;insufficient capacity to innovate&quot; as one of the top five problems in doing businesses. Despite both economies&apos; highly-developed social welfare systems, they both have room for improvement in addressing issues of social inclusion and economic access. In the past few years, organisations have hosted social entrepreneurship conferences and speaker series, creating platforms for knowledge sharing and discussions, and organising field visits for cross-learning. Social innovators there have also realised that they are facing similar issues \u2013 the lack of communication between grass-root organisations and governmental agencies, difficulties in aligning social and business visions, and shortages of socially-minded business practitioners. What could Taiwan and Hong Kong do to increase collaboration to become Asia&apos;s top social innovation hubs? Co-learning for knowledge accumulation Despite their similarities, Taiwan and Hong Kong walked different paths in the past century. Taiwan was colonised by Japan for 50 years before starting its own developmental path. Hong Kong, on the other hand, was ruled by the British for over 100 years. This historical difference shaped the model of social innovation: Hong Kong developed a model with strong British influence, while Taiwan learned many of its lessons from Japan. What&apos;s interesting is that Great Britain and Japan are both pioneers in the field of social innovation. By learning from each other, Hong Kong and Taiwan could blend best practices from the east and west, accumulating a wealth of knowledge on social innovation. To achieve this, the two regions should open up their respective social co-working spaces by hosting each other&apos;s social innovators and collaborating on social projects to effectively foster knowledge exchange and absorb each other&apos;s strengths. Co-operate to expand and grow Neither Taiwan (23.2 million) nor Hong Kong (7.4 million) has a large population. This has been one of the major barriers for social enterprises in both places to achieve scale. Based on the law of comparative advantage, social enterprises on both sides could explore opportunities to sell products in each other&apos;s market, effectively creating a larger market. For example, Taiwan is known for producing high-quality agricultural products, while Hong Kong essentially does not have an agriculture sector. Hence, it is possible for a Taiwanese agricultural social enterprise to sell its products to a Hong Kong food distribution social enterprise. This effectively increases the Taiwanese social enterprise&apos;s potential market share by a third. Moreover, social enterprises can also co-operate in production and marketing. For instance, a medical screening device can be produced by a social enterprise in Taiwan, sold by a different social enterprise in Hong Kong, to elders with chronic medical conditions in Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China and even other Asean economies. Cross-investing to diversify portfolio Venture philanthropy and social investing are more developed in Hong Kong than in Taiwan, not surprising given that Hong Kong has one of the most efficient financial services sectors in the world and ranks No 1 in financial market development (Taiwan ranks No 19). Though Taiwanese society is very generous when it comes to charitable donation, the idea of investing in social-purpose businesses is still novel. If social investors in Hong Kong can start looking into investment opportunities in Taiwan, it would not only help them diversify their investment portfolio, but also give Taiwanese social entrepreneurs a new source of funding. Although still small in size and under-studied, the social innovation sectors in Taiwan and Hong Kong are booming. With collaborative efforts from both sides, Taiwan and Hong Kong will be on their way to becoming Asia&apos;s leading social innovation hubs.

Ministers of all political colours like to link a rise in the country&apos;s place in the various worldwide rankings as testament to their policies, while falls generally get written off as the result of the last government&apos;s failed ideas. There is undoubtedly material for more or less any argument from the different studies: the most recent 65-nation Pisa study, conducted by the OECD, put England 23rd in reading, 27th in maths and 16th in science; data from the Amsterdam-based International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) put England 11th out of 45 nations for reading, with similar rankings for maths and science; while a newer league table by the Economist Intelligence Unit for publisher Pearson had England 6th of 40 nations. A study for the leading educational charity the Sutton Trust, carried out Professor Alan Smithers from Buckingham university, noted that some tables omitted countries deemed ahead of England elsewhere while others used data, for example on university graduation, not considered elsewhere. Small and effectively meaningless differences in raw data could still shift ranking positions and that different tables, it added. &quot;Global education tables have become an increasingly important tool in the political debate in Britain as well as in other developed nations. But league table rankings are not always what they seem, hence the see-sawing in the rankings that we have seen over the years,&quot; said Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust However, Smithers did find that once the differences were removed the main tables gave broadly similar results, with England generally out-performed by a small number of nations such as Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, and consistently by the East Asian nations, which traditionally top such rankings. While UK ministers have said the country should be emulating the likes of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea, Smithers said this might not be the most valuable model. He said: &quot;The superior performance of Asian pupils has been attributed to a culture of hard work and effort, the personality trait of quiet persistence, and distinctive parenting. &quot;After all, Chinese children also shine in England&apos;s education system. There may not be a magic bullet from these countries which can be incorporated into England&apos;s education system, and we may do better to look at those European countries that do well to learn the lessons of their success.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/04/israel-palestine-power-maps-ptolemy", "publicationDate": "2013-02-04T19:15:00Z", "tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "UK news", "Tristram Hunt"], "sentences": ["In 2005 textbooks heading for a Japanese school in China were seized by customs officials who objected to the way Taiwan was coloured differently to the mainland and territories in the East China Sea were claimed for Japan."], "title": "Israel, Palestine and the mapping of power | Tristram Hunt", "article": "&apos;It&apos;s almost comical. The idea of maps is to represent reality; here it represents fantasy.&quot; So Professor Bruce Wexler of Yale University comments on how the vast majority of maps in Palestinian and Israeli schoolbooks omit the existence of the other entity. As a result, children on either side of the Green Line are growing up with &quot;an internal representation of their homeland, in which one does not include the other&quot;. But since when have maps been about objective representation of space? They are about the expression and fulfilment of power. From the age of Ptolemy, all those lofty claims to comprehensiveness have usually succumbed to the promotion of political agendas. As the cartography scholar Jerry Brotton rightly remarks: &quot;A map always manages the reality it tries to show.&quot; Nowhere more so than with the British empire. For in Israel/Palestine, just as in Kashmir and Sudan, postcolonial nations are still wrestling with imperialism&apos;s mixed legacy and its arbitrary lines in the sand. As the colonial unravelling continues, and as rising powers seek to exert their own dominion, the historic confusions of British map-making are fostering all manner of geopolitical tensions. From the outset, cartography and colonialism went hand in hand. The assertion of political control over supposed terra incognita was most effectively realised by drawing up plans and plots. Maps allowed for the expropriation of existing land rights (since indigenous communities often lacked accurate measuring instruments) and an explanation of a colony&apos;s significance. Take Bryan Edwards&apos;s mid-18th century Map of the Island of Barbadoes, with its delineation of the Caribbean landscape into Anglican parishes and sugar plantations. What mattered was Barbados&apos;s role in the imperial project, rather than any realistic representation of its geography or population. Or perhaps the most famous propagation of British colonial power, John Colomb&apos;s 1886 map, Imperial Federation. It placed Britain centre stage, coloured our colonies a distinctive red, inflated the land mass of Canada, left swaths of unconquered terrain simply blank, and at its base posited a serene Britannia surrounded by icons of her Indian, Australian, and African colonies. Resistance to official mapping became part of the story of anti-colonialism. In his 1916 novel Ghare Baire, Tagore has revolutionary hero Sandip ask his hostess, Bimala: &quot;Have I not told you that, in you, I visualise the shakti [power] of our country? The geography of a country is not the whole truth. No one can give up his life for a map!&quot; Instead of British-made maps showing the Raj&apos;s ports and cantonments, Sandip visualises an altogether different map of Mother India, made up of her rivers, jungles, mountains and peoples. It was this anti-rationalist map of India as a maternal bodyscape that would make its way into the Tamil schoolbooks of an independent India. By then, of course, the awful truth was many millions had given up their lives for a map \u2013 thanks to the Mountbatten plan&apos;s partition of India and Pakistan, based on the utilitarian, census-driven mapping of the British civil servant Cyril Radcliffe. The boundaries of India still remain in contention. But today it is a rising China, rather than declining Britain, that is seeking to reshape the map of south-east Asia. New passports issued by Beijing in 2012 counted as Chinese most of Arunachal Pradesh, a north-eastern Indian state that sends parliamentarians to New Delhi. China&apos;s assertive cartography also infuriated the Vietnamese, by claiming ownership of disputed islands in the South China Sea. But it is always school textbooks \u2013 those &quot;weapons of mass instruction&quot; \u2013 that cause the greatest furore. In 2005 textbooks heading for a Japanese school in China were seized by customs officials who objected to the way Taiwan was coloured differently to the mainland and territories in the East China Sea were claimed for Japan. And there is now a real fear that, in Beijing and Tokyo classrooms, map-making is being marshalled for a revived era of tension. So, it is no surprise that officials in Ramallah and Jerusalem are showing once again that space is power by seeking to delegitimise each other. The late Edward Said, chronicler of western constructions of orientalism, understood this more than most. In the last years of his life he published map after map showing Israeli settlements eating into Palestinian land. Because the real problem for Palestinian and Israeli textbooks is that the map keeps changing. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2013/feb/08/cashing-in-effective-ad", "publicationDate": "2013-02-08T16:47:25Z", "tags": ["Advertising", "Media"], "sentences": ["     You are unlikely to have ever heard of Taiwan&apos;s Ta Chong Bank, but this three-minute Dream Rangers commercial, aimed at customers aged 70 and over, was selected for a special screening in London earlier this week by Marie Oldham, chair of the Institute of Practitioners Effectiveness Awards 2012, a contest open to agencies worldwide."], "title": "Cashing in on an effective ad | Media Monkey", "article": "     You are unlikely to have ever heard of Taiwan&apos;s Ta Chong Bank, but this three-minute Dream Rangers commercial, aimed at customers aged 70 and over, was selected for a special screening in London earlier this week by Marie Oldham, chair of the Institute of Practitioners Effectiveness Awards 2012, a contest open to agencies worldwide.

ActiveSync problems with iOS6 &gt;&gt; Tony Redmond&apos;s Exchange Unwashed Blog  Online forums have many reports about ActiveSync problems encountered by Exchange 2007 and Exchange 2010 users after upgrading their Apple devices to iOS6. One issue is when a user apparently &quot;hijacks&quot; a meeting by being made its organizer after they open a meeting request,sometimes associated with delegate access to the organizer&apos;s mailbox. A related issue might be when a user edits a meeting on their device only to send a cancellation message to all involved, even when the meeting request isn&apos;t sent by a delegate.  Some reports indicate a connection with devices that synchronize with the Apple iCloud, others say that this isn&apos;t a factor. What&apos;s confusing the issue is that, aside from working with meeting requests on an iOS6 device (and potentially only devices that have been upgraded to iOS6 rather than coming fresh from the factory with iOS6 preinstalled), there doesn&apos;t seem to be great commonality across the reported concerns.   iOS 6 is looking a bit buggy, generally.

But failed to mention 100s of artists who made not only the main character of the tiger, but replaced that pool, making it look like a real ocean for 80% of his movie.&quot;  Branit&apos;s post comes on the back of increasing restlessness in the VFX sector, which saw a 450-strong protest outside the Oscar ceremony and a plane buzz the red carpet towing the slogan &quot;Box Office + Bankrupt = Visual Effects vfxunion.com&quot;. Branit also pointed out that Lee in recent weeks had complained about the cost of VFX, without suggesting similar cutbacks in actor and director pay: &quot;Ang Lee has not discussed how actors&apos; salaries could be cheaper, or how director or producer&apos;s percentages could be limited. Yet it is valid to argue that visual effect played an equal if not greater role in making the movie Ang wanted to make.&quot; Of particular concern is the recent Chapter 11 bankrupcty of Life of Pi&apos;s effects house Rhythm &amp; Hues \u2013 but as evidenced in an open letter published two years ago by Eric Roth, executive director of the Visual Effects Society, resentment has been building for a considerable time in the VFX community, which unlike other areas of the film industry remains largely unregulated and non-unionised, over what it sees as unfair distribution of profits."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/01/ukip-other-policies-bike-taxes", "publicationDate": "2013-03-01T11:08:06Z", "tags": ["Eastleigh byelection", "UK Independence party (Ukip)", "Byelections", "Politics"], "sentences": ["The foreign affairs commitment to formally back independence for Taiwan has its arguments but would risk losing the UK very significant amounts of trade from an irate China."], "title": "Ukip's other policies, from bike tax discs to aircraft carriers", "article": "Much as the Good Friday peace agreement saw Northern Ireland&apos;s once single-focus sectarian parties scramble to pull together policies on the likes of bus services and waste disposal, so is Ukip&apos;s second place in the Eastleigh byelection likely to bring increased scrutiny of its views beyond the two key messages on Europe and immigration. Delve into the policy documents on Ukip&apos;s website and two things emerge most clearly. Firstly, while it is perhaps unfair to label them 1950s revivalists, there is a distinctly nostalgic tone to many ideas: grammar schools, respect for the police, a strong Royal Navy, regular references to ending &quot;political correctness&quot; and multiculturalism. Also, Ukip has the minor party&apos;s luxury of promising to lavish money on projects while being somewhat vague on where this cash will be found. For an officially free-market party, Ukip made a perhaps surprising number of significant state spending commitments in its last full policy document, the 2010 election manifesto: \u2022 Defence spending would rise by 40%, with the navy getting more than 70 new ships, including three aircraft carriers. \u2022 The number of prison places would be doubled, with \u00a330bn committed to flood defences and an unquantified further amount going to transport investment, including high-speed rail lines, more roads and improved ports and airports. \u2022 Almost \u00a390bn would be committed to a mass programme of building nuclear power stations. The spending seemingly relies upon presumed savings from leaving the EU, which \u2013 the manifesto estimates, without giving a source \u2013 could total \u00a3120bn a year. There are similarly woolly promises about economies from cutting red tape and &quot;non-jobs&quot;. Tax plans are more predictably new right, with a proposed flat combined income tax and national insurance rate of 31% for any annual income above \u00a311,500. One of the party&apos;s more controversial views is its position on energy and climate change. Ukip is avowedly sceptical about human-caused climate change, claiming that &quot;more and more scientists are challenging the conventional wisdom on global warming&quot;. Ukip&apos;s solution would be a radical rollback of renewable energy projects, such as wind farms, in favour of nuclear power and the likes of shale gas. While much of this combines into a relatively coherent message, some policy details can look contradictory or even a bit crankish, perhaps the result of one or a few activists imposing their personal opinions on a still relatively tiny party. Education is a case in point. While schools policy is a fairly straightforward mix of free market and nostalgia \u2013 parents would get vouchers to spend in the private or state sector, with the latter seeing the launch of new grammar schools and a focus on the three Rs \u2013 the position on universities seems a bit more anomalous. Ukip is scathing about the &quot;nonsensical target&quot; of having 50% of people attending university, arguing for example that nurses need vocational training rather than degrees. Yet the party also wants a return to state grants for students rather than loans. As some education websites note, how do you reduce university access while simultaneously making it a more attractive option? By a very non-free market cap on places, perhaps? Other details look fraught with unforeseen difficulties, or somewhat niche. The foreign affairs commitment to formally back independence for Taiwan has its arguments but would risk losing the UK very significant amounts of trade from an irate China. The separate policy document on animal welfare is perhaps laudable, but the public is maybe not at the stage where it needs a long list of specific Ukip promises about breeding pedigree dogs. Cyclists who voted Ukip in Eastleigh meanwhile, might be alarmed to learn the party believes bicycles should have tax discs, while riders should pay for parking and walk their bikes across busy roundabouts to prevent &quot;unacceptable delays to traffic&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/mar/01/world-baseball-classic-2013-preview", "publicationDate": "2013-03-01T12:00:00Z", "tags": ["World Baseball Classic", "MLB", "US sports", "Sport"], "sentences": ["Starting out east, in Pool A, Japan, Cuba, China and Brazil are in Fukuoka, Japan while Taichung, Taiwan hosts Pool B, where Chinese Taipei, South Korea, Australia and those pesky Dutch are setting up shop."], "title": "The World Baseball Classic is back", "article": "In the run up the World Baseball Classic all the talk has been about what player from which country isn&apos;t going to play for whatever reason. If the likes of Yu Darvish (Japan), Justin Verlander (USA), Travis Blackley (Australia) and several Cubans playing in MLB, effectively banned from their national team aren&apos;t in, then why should I be? Well, I hear ya, but I&apos;m here to tell you that you&apos;ll be making a mistake if you ignore the Classic, which will be played out for a third time starting Saturday.  Back in 2006, the WBC became the first tournament in baseball history to put professional players in national team colors after the International Baseball Federation, Major League Baseball and professional leagues from participating countries came together to produce an event that would crown a true world champion for the very first time - not to be confused with a World Series champion of course. It was also one of several reasons that baseball got canned from the Olympics a few years later, the WBC serving official notice that active Major League players would never play in the Games because Major League Baseball would never, ever pause its season to accommodate the IOC as the NHL has done in recent years.  Finally, those of us who were pining for such an event had reason to celebrate, others were about to be exposed to something as close to top flight international baseball as we are ever going to get, while Major League Baseball team officials began their new quadrennial past time of complaining about how many of their players were leaving Spring Training for over two weeks (the Twins and Brewers are among teams sending the most players, the Mets are only sending David Wright while the A&apos;s are sending no one).  Personally speaking, I was hooked (although I am an easy sell) from the very first WBC game I watched - Panama vs the mysterious Cubans in March &apos;06. I had just arrived in Costa Rica, finding the first round contest on the hotel television despite the protests from my future wife who, for some reason, wanted to leave the hotel room and get to the beach. I wasn&apos;t moving - locked into a chaotic ninth inning.  Panama gave up two runs in the top half of the frame before rallying to tie it up in the bottom of the inning. Cuban hurler Yuniesky Maya came within a hair of gifting the Panamanians an upset victory, just missing Ruben Rivera with a bases loaded pitch. &quot;It&apos;s March and it feels like October,&quot; I thought. &quot;This is incredible.&quot; Cuba, which needed special permission from the United States government to even compete at the event would win it in the 11th - I began our vacation in the doghouse.  At some point during this World Baseball Classic that Fall feeling will return, along with a postseason atmosphere that makes you wonder how and why it took so long to get this tournament together in the first place. (It&apos;s worth mentioning that according to Growing the Game by Alan M Klein, MLB officials began discussing a World Cup as early as 1993, with drug testing and dealings with the Japanese and Korean leagues amongst the reasons it took 13 years for the WBC to come to fruition).  There will be drama, as we saw when Japan beat South Korea in the 2009 final - Ichiro belting a two out run-scoring double in the 10th, helping to secure his country a second straight title in front of nearly 55,000 at Dodger Stadium.             There will be intrigue, like when the Dutch wiped the smiles off Jose Reyes&apos; and David Ortiz&apos; Dominican Republic team, not once, but twice four years ago, proving that a European team could indeed do damage against a baseball powerhouse.  Yes, these moments will come, and you will be into it, despite an imperfect tournament with its share of flaws. Loose citizenship requirements mean that players have an easier time representing countries they could never play for if it were, say, a FIFA World Cup. There are restrictions on pitch counts that remind us of the leash around the necks of the players, many of whom are out of form following the offseason. Then of course are the players that opt out, some due to pressure from their teams, who keep a watchful eye on their assets.  There is also room for debate as to what is the right timing for the WBC. I wouldn&apos;t mind seeing it played out in November after the World Series, with players not involved in MLB and other leagues&apos; post-seasons keeping warm in training camps. Yes, the powers-that-be would prefer to not take on the NFL, not to mention the start of the NBA and NHL seasons, and there are doubts that players, already exhausted from a full season, would want to stick around and wait for a tournament, but, a November tournament could potentially allow for fewer restrictions on players who could go all out and still have around three months to rest and recover from any injuries.  Still, despite the lack of a perfect time to play the event and the issues surrounding a tournament in its infancy, the WBC&apos;s glass is more than half full - there are some 45 all-stars set to play while it is set to feature two qualifying teams, baseball outsiders Brazil and Spain, for the first time. The WBC&apos;s creation of a qualifying round helps to legitimise it as a truly global event - it&apos;s now an open door affair that includes countries such as Thailand, Israel, Great Britain, Germany and New Zealand, after they battled for those two spots late last year. That&apos;s good news for countries where the sport is seeking to plant roots.  So, how does it all work? I&apos;m glad you asked.  The two opening rounds are split up geographically, with eight teams based in Asia and eight based in North America and the Caribbean. Starting out east, in Pool A, Japan, Cuba, China and Brazil are in Fukuoka, Japan while Taichung, Taiwan hosts Pool B, where Chinese Taipei, South Korea, Australia and those pesky Dutch are setting up shop. Those games are first up starting on Saturday.  On March 7th, Pool C and D get going - Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Spain and PR will play in San Juan while Phoenix plays host to the USA, Mexico, Canada and Italy.  The top two Asian based teams in each pool get together in Tokyo for the second round, which is a modified double elimination format - Miami hosts the games for the teams based in the Western Hemisphere. Two teams advance from each group to the Championship Round which will be in San Francisco from March 17th - 19th.  Who will take the colorfully named World Baseball Classic trophy? Well, it probably won&apos;t be Spain or Brazil, especially with the first Brazilian born player to reach MLB, Yan Gomes, disappointingly not participating. I&apos;d like to say it&apos;s wide open, but it&apos;s not, the Japanese will make it a trifecta as the US disappoints, again. Despite the fact that Japan will be without any MLB players, meaning Ichiro and Yu Darvish are out, they send the best men from their league and take this very, very seriously. That&apos;s not to say other teams don&apos;t care, because they do, and even though many players aren&apos;t in mid-season form, when the chips are down, I trust they&apos;ll be sliding head first into first base (even though we all know it isn&apos;t very smart when it comes to staying healthy).  Part of what makes the WBC so welcome is the change of pace - different uniforms, teammates facing off, Cubans hugging during pitching changes, a refreshing change from the norm, not to mention the monotony of Spring Training. It&apos;s early days, and the event still needs baseball outsiders such as Italy and Australia to become competitive to really boost baseball to another level globally. Still, coming into its third edition, the WBC has at the very least carved a substantial niche in the sporting calendar, something that seemed a distant possibility only a short time ago."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/02/this-weeks-new-film-events", "publicationDate": "2013-03-02T06:00:11Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "sentences": ["There are also new faces and places, such as Taiwan&apos;s Yang Ya-Che, whose decades-friendship saga Gf*Bf has been a local hit, while Poor Folk tracks smuggling across the Thai-Burmese border, and 111 Girls hinges on a collective suicide in Kurdistan."], "title": "This week's new film events", "article": "Psych-Out: The Surreal Side Of Euro-Cult, Newcastle upon Tyne If your definition of psychedelic cinema goes further than Peter Fonda saying &quot;Far out&quot;, prepare to have your mind exploded.

The DOD will receive a 7.9% reduction, amounting to about $42.7bn in cuts. Defense spending is the sacred cow of Washington and in the run-up to the implementation of the sequester, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers sought to find ways to spare the Pentagon. The sequester, however, may prove a useful way to break the national myth perpetuated by politicians that cuts to defense spending would be a national security disaster. For the past 60 years, a culture of militarization has taken hold in America ensuring that both parties continually overspend on defense while neglecting other important national priorities. The over-emphatic and myopic focus of American politicians on defense spending is extremely dangerous. As Duke University Professor Peter Feaver has argued (pdf), the &quot;ability of the military to destroy a state by draining it of resources in a quest for ever greater strength as a hedge against the enemies of the state&quot; is a serious risk to national security. In the United States, the military certainly lobbies for its interests, as it should. But American civilian leaders have become so enamored of the use of force and the military that they are no longer capable of putting the defense budget and America&apos;s national security priorities into a wider strategic framework informed by the overall national interest. Consider the following. The United States total defense and defense-related expenditures was between $1tn and $1.4tn last year. The DOD alone cost over $700bn. This is far more expenditure than the entire rest of the world combined. The next largest group of defense spenders is the European Union, all of which are American allies. The trillions Europe spends on defense, however, does not mean that the EU could militarily match the US \u2013 after all, Europe ran out of bombs in Nato&apos;s Libya campaign and had to be bailed out by the US. Meanwhile, China, considered one of the possible future challenges to the United States, will spend $114bn in 2013. Russia, the state former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney called the United States&apos; &quot;No 1 geopolitical foe&quot;, spends only $71.9bn. That is just barely double the amount of the US is cutting to its defense budget under the sequester. The US possesses by far the most advanced sea, land and air forces in the world. The American navy alone wields enormous destructive power. Take aircraft carriers \u2013 a typical indicator of traditional military power. The US navy currently operates 11 aircraft carrier strike groups. China has one carrier, which is really only a training platform. Russia has one old carrier dating from the cold war \u2013 and that was immobilized in the late 1990s because Moscow could not afford to maintain the ship.  The United States has the responsibility for ensuring the freedom of the seas and therefore does require a well-equipped navy. But the superiority of the US navy is so great today, that no other state even dreams of competing with it. Beijing, rather than creating a blue-water fleet to match US capabilities, is focusing on advanced technologies in the hope of cancelling out US naval forces&apos; strategic advantage.  When a Chinese submarine popped up inside the security perimeter of the USS Kitty Hawk carrier strike force in October 2006, it demonstrated the general direction the Chinese were taking towards American sea power. Why should Beijing send a Chinese aircraft carrier strike force to challenge a US force when it could spend less and be more effective with different systems? The 3,000 missiles that China has pointed at Taiwan also mean that using a US carrier battle group to defend Taiwan would simply result in a larger number of US ships at the bottom of the Taiwan Straits \u2013 a body of water too narrow for American naval power to be effective.  Supporters of American defense spending will say that the sheer size of the American military is what dissuades peer competitors from challenging the US directly. There is some merit to this argument, but there is such a large gap between the US and the rest of the world that it would behove American politicians to focus on more acute threats to the United States&apos; position in the world.  America&apos;s domestic infrastructure is woefully out of date. The World Economic Forum ranks the US No 16 in the developed world, indicating a serious deficit in US economic potential and competitiveness. The country&apos;s electrical network is fractured and unable to distribute power across the national network \u2013 a crucial feature of a system that might benefit from renewable energy produced in one area of the country but required in another. The performance of American schools drops year after year, with only 6% of US students scoring at the advanced level in international tests. Underfunded American public universities are increasingly becoming unaffordable. Former chairman of the joint chiefs, Admiral Mike Mullen, once said that the national debt was the biggest threat facing the US today. Focusing on domestic revitalization and a responsible budget would be a good way for American to preserve its standing in the world \u2013 instead of excessive defense spending.  Before he died, at the age of 101, the US diplomat George Kennan lamented that nearly no American alive today could recall the country before it was overly militarized during the cold war. Instead of viewing the military as a necessity in times of war and a luxury in times of peace, American politicians have mortgaged the future health of the nation for unnecessary defense spending. Most ironically, as the 9/11 attacks, the bombing of the London Underground and cyber-attacks against European banks illustrate, armed forces are not always relevant to the most pressing security risks of the 21st century. It is best that the sequester smashes the golden cow of American defense spending. The economic ramifications of such unplanned cuts will be painful for the country. But Americans will finally see that a reduction in defense spending does not herald the end of the world. Perhaps, then it will be possible for politicians in Washington to pursue a responsible national budget \u2013 one in which defense gets its due share, but is subject to necessary constraint."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/05/samsung-galaxy-s4-leak-phone", "publicationDate": "2013-03-06T15:40:00Z", "tags": ["Samsung", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Technology", "Android"], "sentences": ["It also has the second-largest profit in the smartphone business, behind Apple - with which it is one of only four companies making a profit in the smartphone business, along with Taiwan&apos;s HTC and Finland&apos;s Nokia."], "title": "Galaxy S4 leaks denied as details of Samsung's flagship handset emerge", "article": "Claims that specifications for Samsung&apos;s forthcoming flagship Galaxy GS 4 - to be launched in New York on 14 March - have been leaked online have been denied by Expansys, the British company which specialises in selling unlocked phones. A series of tweets on Tuesday morning from @evleaks, an account which focusses on the smartphone market, suggested that the phone will have a super AMOLED screen, a 13-megapixel rear camera, and LED flash.  Separate reports by the New York Times on Monday suggested that the S4, as it is expected to be called, will include an eye-tracking technology that will scroll pages on the screen according to where the user is looking, using a new system developed by Samsung and called Eye Scroll. But the @evleaks tweets were quickly discredited after Expansys said that the diagrams that had been tweeted actually came from its own site - and that they were its artists&apos; impressions of what a Galaxy S4 might look like, rather than actual pictures. With the launch due next week, the handset is expected to start shipping in Europe by the end of March or early April, and in the US by June.  Samsung&apos;s integrated supply chain - meaning that it makes its own parts - means that few details about the phone have leaked out ahead of the launch. But it is expected to have a slightly bigger screen, at 4.9in or 5in, than the Galaxy S3 released a year ago.  Some estimates suggest that Samsung expects to sell 10m of the handsets per month, and 100m during 2013. It is also expected to run Android 4.2.1, come with 2GB of RAM, between 16 and 64GB of storage - and possibly up to 128GB - Near Field Communications, LTE/4G capability. It is forecast to have an eight-core ARM processor, possibly from Qualcomm. Other rumours point to a gesture-controlled interface rather than a pen-based system. That would separate Samsung&apos;s phones even further from other Android rivals, and tie users more closely into its own ecosystem of apps and functions. Samsung is already the largest smartphone manufacturer in the world, and makes nearly half of all Android phones. It also has the second-largest profit in the smartphone business, behind Apple - with which it is one of only four companies making a profit in the smartphone business, along with Taiwan&apos;s HTC and Finland&apos;s Nokia. Samsung has been building up its portfolio of services to distinguish itself from rival Android smartphone handsets for the past years. It is also expected to unleash a huge marketing and advertising campaign to go with the new phone: Samsung Electronics&apos; marketing spending dwarfs that of any rival company, including Apple, Microsoft, and bigger names such as Coca-Cola. However expectations that the GS4 might have a flexible display have been played down by analysts.  Richard Windsor, formerly with Nomura Securities and now an independent technology analyst, commented: &quot;We have been waiting for these for over a year and still there is no sign of [bendable screens]. Some prototypes were shown at CES, but a quick ramble through YouTube will show you that those same prototypes have actually been on display for more than two years.&quot; Windsor explains: &quot;I think that the problem is encapsulation. The OLED substrate is very sensitive to degradation by oxygen meaning that the panel has to be perfectly sealed from the air. This has proved to be much more difficult to do in flexible plastic than rigid glass and I suspect that the yields are still so low that Samsung can not yet put it in a product.&quot; He added: &quot;This [flexible screen] is Samsung&apos;s silver bullet against the ravages on commoditisation in Android, but fortunately Samsung does not need it to work right away. This could be another story in another 12 months.&quot; Samsung&apos;s chief product officer Kevin Packingham told the New York Times that the Galaxy S4 is &quot;an amazing phone&quot; overall.

The more troubling is that the cancer burden in developing countries is high and growing, yet there is very little treatment, let alone prevention, even though basic interventions such as screening for cervical cancer and giving women with breast cancer cheap generic drugs such as tamoxifen would save thousands of lives. The other is that the vast amount of cancer research is failing to make the sort of progress we once expected and is costing a fortune. New so-called targeted drugs are not living up to their promise. Cancer treatment is becoming unaffordably expensive, even in rich countries. This is the how the statement neatly defines the problem:  The global burden of cancer includes 12.7m newly diagnosed cases per year, of which more than half occur in less developed regions of the world. Cancers now account for more than 15% of the world&apos;s annual deaths (&gt;7.5 million per year), and that number is rising, especially in less affluent countries. Moreover, cancers are among the most feared medical conditions, often causing prolonged periods of suffering, requiring substantial healthcare expenditures for advanced care, and being fought with medical tools that are relatively ineffective and themselves frequently disabling.  The authors want the cancer community to come out of its silos. Instead of each country tackling the particular cancers that afflict its citizens, there is a need to join together to make better progress, as well as to start things happening in countries where there is no help at all for men, women and children with the disease. And there are some things that can be done without advanced laboratories. First, there needs to be a big push against tobacco, which is a major cause of many different cancers. The report urges action from governments in the developing countries that tobacco companies now consider their best hope of more profits. It calls for big taxes on tobacco to try to prevent the habit taking off in sub-Saharan Africa, efforts to deglamourise it and stop health professionals setting a bad example by smoking. This is Hazel Nunn, head of health and evidence and information at CRUK:  While the focus of an organisation like Cancer Research UK must begin at home, we have a moral responsibility to work with others to ensure the scourge of tobacco-related cancers doesn&apos;t engulf the poorest countries of the world while we are looking the other way.  The scientists call for cheaper versions of the HPV vaccine, against the virus which triggers most cervical cancer, to be developed and used across poor countries. And they want more research into vaccines against other cancer-causing viruses, like hepatitis C. They want all countries to develop their own cancer plan and for new drugs to reach them faster. On research, the statement calls for scientists to share their results in more open databases, so that everyone can learn from what goes well and what goes wrong. And they are categorically opposed to the patenting of genetic data \u2013 as companies have tried to do with breast cancer genes. These, they say, are obstacles to cancer research. Cancer Research UK hopes this document will prove a turning point in the fight against cancer, enlisting governments as well as scientific establishments and research funders in a global cause \u2013 to defeat a disease that knows no borders."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/07/john-lewis-bonus-17-percent-2012", "publicationDate": "2013-03-07T18:45:00Z", "tags": ["John Lewis", "Retail industry", "Business", "Executive pay and bonuses", "UK news", "Waitrose", "Work & careers", "Money"], "sentences": ["The supermarket&apos;s exports rose 20% in 2012 as it expanded into South Korea, Taiwan, Gibraltar and Trinidad, making a total of 30 countries."], "title": "John Lewis staff celebrate bonus of nine weeks' pay", "article": "The John Lewis retail chain has handed its 84,700 staff an annual bonus worth 17% of their salary \u2013 the equivalent of nine weeks&apos; pay \u2013 as the employee-owned company continues to outperform its rivals. Staff at John Lewis&apos;s Oxford Street store whooped and clapped as the better-than-expected bonus \u2013 which is handed to all employees, from cashiers to chairman Charlie Mayfield \u2013 was revealed on Thursday against a gloomy backdrop for some other retailers. The bonus for an employee on average salary would be \u00a34,000. But the John Lewis Partnership warned it was reviewing its pension, one of the few non-contributory final-salary schemes left in the country. It said: &quot;During the next year the partnership will be undertaking a review of the pension scheme to ensure that it can remain fair to partners and sustainable from a business perspective.&quot; The \u00a3210.8m bonus payout, up from \u00a3165.2m last year, followed a 9.1% rise in sales to \u00a38.47bn. Profits for the group, which owns the Waitrose supermarket chain as well as 39 department stores, were up 15.8% on last year to \u00a3409.6m, before accounting for tax and the bonus. The latest burst of growth brings the partnership within a whisker of Marks &amp; Spencer&apos;s UK sales of \u00a38.9bn for the year to March 2012. A big part of that growth came online, with sales up 40.8% at Johnlewis.com. Waitrose&apos;s online business rose 49%, compared with 19% for the grocery market as a whole. Both the group&apos;s chains have gained market share over the year. Natalie Jempeji, section manager in lingerie at John Lewis Oxford Street, said: &quot;It&apos;s a bit more than I was expecting so I&apos;m happy with that. I&apos;m going to spend the money on a holiday to Turkey for my birthday later in the year.&quot; George Young, section manager of furnishing fabrics, who has been in the partnership for 45 years and helped open the outsized envelope containing the bonus figure, said: &quot;This is the last bonus before I retire. I&apos;m going to take my wife to Cornwall to enjoy a nice holiday that will set me up for retirement.&quot; The company said it had reaped the benefit from its investment in technology and lower prices, as well as shoppers&apos; trust in its brands during the horsemeat scandal and tough times on the high street that have seen the demise of rivals. Mayfield, whose most recently disclosed salary was \u00a3825,000, said: &quot;These results have been achieved against a market that remains subdued, but we believe the market is stabilising and there are some opportunities out there.&quot; The chairman added that the outlook for the economy was becoming clearer as fears about the collapse of the eurozone subsided. This year, John Lewis will be investing over \u00a3200m, more than ever before, in store refurbishments, a new warehouse and future stores, although no new outlets will open this year. Waitrose, meanwhile, is planning to open 20 stores this year and a new distribution centre in Lancashire to support growth in the north of England and Scotland. The two sides of the partnership will also be looking at more ways to work closer together after launching a service that allows shoppers to pick up goods ordered at Johnlewis.com at Waitrose stores. Andrew Murphy, director of retail operations, said the group would be opening another Waitrose inside a John Lewis, as it has done in Oxford Street and Bluewater, and was looking for at least two more sites where John Lewis and Waitrose could open neighbouring stores. In Ipswich, where such co-location is already operating, sales are running 30% above expectations four months after the stores opened. Neil Saunders, managing director of retail analyst Conlumino, said: &quot;One of the most impressive features of John Lewis over the past year has been its ability to keep many plates spinning simultaneously. The pace and quality of innovation and initiatives has been extremely strong and is one of the central reasons for its outperformance.&quot; A 29% surge in sales of electrical goods such as iPads and TVs boosted sales at John Lewis last year as major high street rival Comet collapsed. Waitrose saw its market share rise from 4.7% to 4.9% after it opened 19 new stores and promised to match Tesco&apos;s prices on branded goods and expanded its Essential range of low-price basic foods. Mark Price, managing director of Waitrose, said the chain&apos;s prices were now on average 1% cheaper than Sainsbury&apos;s. He said the Little Waitrose convenience store chain made a profit for the first time in 2012, its third year in existence, and he plans to open at least 10 more of the small shops this year. Both Waitrose and John Lewis experienced a gradual rise in the pace of growth over the year and that momentum has continued in 2013. Gross sales rose 10.5% in the first five weeks of the year, with like-for likes sales up 13.7% at the department stores and 6.4% at the supermarket compared with the same period in 2012. Overseas plans John Lewis is seeking partnerships with overseas department stores after a successful trial in South Korea. Andy Street, its managing director, said the company wanted relationships with &quot;other prestigious department stores around the world on a wholesale or licence model&quot;. He said John Lewis had no intention of opening its own stores abroad but is planning dedicated websites in France and Germany this year. It launched a version of its English site in 33 countries in 2011. The Waitrose chain is also expanding abroad. It now has seven licensed shops in the Middle East and plans four more this year. The supermarket&apos;s exports rose 20% in 2012 as it expanded into South Korea, Taiwan, Gibraltar and Trinidad, making a total of 30 countries. This year, Waitrose has started delivering to Ibiza and several Caribbean islands."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/08/activist-police-harassment-china-us", "publicationDate": "2013-03-08T12:26:06Z", "tags": ["China", "US news", "Chen Guangcheng", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["Lu arrived in the US via Taiwan on 3 December and is currently living with his wife in Washington DC, according to Hu Jia, a prominent dissident in Beijing who spoke with Lu via phone on Thursday."], "title": "Activist who faced police harassment in China is in US", "article": "A prominent Chinese activist is now living in the United States, US officials have confirmed, amid concerns that Chinese authorities have ratcheted up pressure on dissidents to maintain social stability during two weeks of important political meetings in Beijing. Lu Haitao, a 38-year-old writer and blogger, was repeatedly harassed, detained and interrogated by police last year for vocally supporting Chen Guangcheng, a blind activist-lawyer who escaped house arrest and sought refuge in the American embassy last spring. The state department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland confirmed that Lu was in the US but refused to give further details, including whether Lu had been granted political asylum. &quot;We don&apos;t confirm or deny asylum issues,&quot; she told Voice of America. Lu arrived in the US via Taiwan on 3 December and is currently living with his wife in Washington DC, according to Hu Jia, a prominent dissident in Beijing who spoke with Lu via phone on Thursday. &quot;The American state department has been giving them guidance, teaching them how to enrol in school and how to study English with other new immigrants,&quot; Hu said in a phone interview. According to Amnesty International, Lu was evicted from his residence last year after visiting two of Chen&apos;s family members in rural Shandong province; he faced &quot;incessant police interrogation&quot; after the lawyer escaped. &quot;Sustained police harassment&quot; may have caused his wife to have a miscarriage, according to the organisation. This week, hundreds of high-level party members converged on Beijing for China&apos;s annual &quot;Two Meetings&quot;, two weeks of rhetoric-laden work reports and political discussions. The Washington-DC-based NGO China Human Rights Defenders said that as part of a wideranging security crackdown during the meetings, Beijing&apos;s dissidents have been detained, beaten at police stations, and forcibly removed from the capital to &quot;travel&quot;. According to the organisation, police in Tiananmen Square seized thousands of petitioners \u2013 citizens attempting to air their grievances to the central government \u2013 on 5 March alone. &quot;Officials or hired thugs from various parts of China have intercepted and forcibly returned many of these individuals to their home towns,&quot; it said. Hu said that although he had been closely monitored by public security agents since 2012, they began entering his apartment late last month without giving him any reason or warning. &quot;I&apos;ve never had pressure like this before,&quot; he said. Tsering Woeser, a Tibetan writer, was placed under 20 days of house arrest beginning on 1 March, she said in a phone interview on Thursday. Two public security officers escort her every time she leaves her apartment, even on simple errands. &quot;I can still go out, but I need to tell them where and what I am going to, and I have to take their cars,&quot; she said. Woeser was awarded the US state department&apos;s international women of courage award on 4 March as &quot;the most prominent mainland activist speaking out publicly about human rights conditions for China&apos;s Tibetan citizens&quot;. Last May, Chinese authorities confined her to her home to prevent her from receiving a Prince Claus award at the Dutch embassy. &quot;The government always uses big words, like strength or rejuvenation, but actually, it is weak and autocratic,&quot; said Woeser. &quot;I don&apos;t think what I&apos;ve said about Tibet is excessive, and I am telling the truth. But the government doesn&apos;t want the truth, and they dread to hear \u2013 and do not allow \u2013 different voices.&quot; On Tuesday, Chinese authorities announced plans to spend \u00a382bn on domestic security this year, about \u00a33bn higher than the projected defence budget."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/11/usa-cuba-world-baseball-classic", "publicationDate": "2013-03-11T18:22:01Z", "tags": ["World Baseball Classic", "MLB", "US sports", "Sport", "Baseball"], "sentences": ["Rising Sun Taiwan had the two-time WBC defending champions Japan on the ropes in the first game of second round play.", "At the Tokyo Dome, Taiwan were a strike away from putting away the home team (actually, Taiwan were the home team, even though they weren&apos;t home), when Hirokazu Ibata (1.500 WBC OPS) came through with a clutch RBI base hit that tied the score at 2-2.", "Taiwan, a team that had looked like one of the best while playing at home in the first round, ran out of gas after the dramatic, crushing loss, getting pummeled by Cuba 14-0 in their next game.", "Still, Taiwan showed progress, with Chien-Ming Wang in particular standing out - the free agent tossed 12 scoreless WBC innings while seeking a new professional contract."], "title": "USA survive but Cuba depart World Baseball Classic | David Lengel", "article": "Phew! If you heard an unusual noise on Sunday night there&apos;s a decent chance it was a giant sigh of relief from the organisers of the World Baseball Classic. Team USA were six outs away from a last place finish in Pool D before rallying past Canada and booking an appearance in the second round. A loss not only would that have meant that the United States, a major WBC draw, would not be joining Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and, wait for it...Italy in Miami, but a last place finish in the group meant they would have had to go through the humiliating task of qualifying for the 2017 tournament. It was a crazy enough scenario to begin daydreaming about the details - those games are played in September and November before a WBC, putting the presence of MLB players in doubt. &quot;Hey David Wright, I know you just played an entire season, but can you come back from Tahiti to make a November game against Thailand? We could really use you man.&quot;  In the end, Team USA, flat as a pancake in their loss against Mexico, bailed out by a Wright grand slam against the red hot Italians, came through with a late inning rally against the punch drunk Canadians (more on that below), who with a one run eighth inning lead and second round games in their sights may have been daydreaming a bit themselves.  And so much to the delight of tournament officials, one of the pillars of WBC attendance advanced, securing decent crowds in Miami as Joe Torre took that familiar walk to the mound to congratulate his men on a victory. With seven runs in two innings, and overcoming the appearance of Heath Bell in a big spot late vs eliminated Canada (Scott Schoeneweis wasn&apos;t available), perhaps Team USA, which will face Puerto Rico on Tuesday, are gaining the kind of momentum they&apos;ll need to secure their first WBC title.   &quot;It would have been embarrassing if we had lost,&quot; said Brandon Phillips. &quot;USA, this is where baseball started. We have to represent our country. And I feel like if we had lost, we didn&apos;t do our job. &quot;This is a blessing in disguise, man. We shouldn&apos;t have been here. But we picked ourselves up. It&apos;s a beautiful thing. It&apos;s a dream come true.&quot;  Base-brawl The World Baseball Classic entered new territory when Mexico&apos;s and Canada&apos;s benches cleared on Saturday night (it&apos;s alright for fighting) during its very first brawl. Mexico were disappointed with Canada&apos;s lack of adherence to the &quot;unwritten rules&quot; of baseball when catcher Chris Robinson bunted for a hit looking to get a run-scoring inning going in the top of the ninth. This upset Mexico because the bunt came with the Canadians ahead by six runs, and so it was seen as something of a baseball crime. Arnold Leon threw at the next batter, Ron Tasoni, and all hell broke loose. There were multiple haymakers, police involvement with even some of the crowd getting involved - seven ejections in all. It was an entertaining scrap if I am allowed to say that, even if it was asinine, if I am allowed to say that. Ties between teams in pool and second round play can be broken on run difference, and with Pool D airtight, Canada were well within their right to try and tack on runs despite their lead. It should also be noted that six runs is not what I would call an insurmountable lead, so while the bunt was a bit unusual for a team in a commanding position, it wasn&apos;t like they were throwing into the endzone up by 40 points with five seconds left.  Anyway, both managers used the occasion to complain about runs figuring into the tie breaking procedure because it can interfere with rules that aren&apos;t written - a new one for me. None suggested alternatives as far as I know. The WBC schedule is already tight and so extra games are out of the question. How else are they supposed to break ties? A coin flip? Corner kicks?  The good news for the teams is that there were no suspensions.   &quot;Because at least one club -- and potentially both -- will not advance to the second round, WBCI has determined that disciplinary measures would not have a meaningful corrective impact. Thus, discipline will not be imposed beyond today&apos;s seven game ejections.&quot;  That&apos;s another way of saying that we are not prepared to trash our tournament because of these idiots. Tournament officials almost got it right - Leon should have been sent home for taking three pitches to hit Tosoni. Honk if you love honkball! The Netherlands advanced to the Championship Round for the first time after defeating Cuba 7-6 at the Tokyo Dome in a game that had all the benchmarks of a high stakes playoff encounter.  The Netherlands came into Monday&apos;s game down two regulars, including the Washington Nationals Roger Bernedina, losing a third after Yurendell de Caster was carted off the field after running to first base. No matter, Kalian Sams&apos; walk-off sac fly scored Andruw Jones, sending the Cubans home in a loss that will be taken hard in Habana. They had their chances. With the two on and no out in the 7th, Cuban manager Victor Mesa, who is a baseball reality show waiting to happen, had one of their best offensive players, Yulieski Gurriel, bunt. He popped it up for the first out, and then Jose Fernandez bounced into a double play - inning over, inexplicable managing. Cuba would take a 6-4 lead later, but in the bottom of the eighth, with the Netherlands four outs away from elimination, Andrelton Simmons shocked the favorites with a two-run blast that tied the game for the third time. Mesa was up to his Tony La Russa-ish tricks in the bottom of the ninth, changing pitchers three times before the Netherlands completed their fifth consecutive victory over the IBAF&apos;s top ranked team and booked their ticket to AT&amp;T Park, where a European(ish) club will compete for the title for the first time. It was more than enough to make front page headlines in the Algemeen Dagblad.  Rising Sun Taiwan had the two-time WBC defending champions Japan on the ropes in the first game of second round play. At the Tokyo Dome, Taiwan were a strike away from putting away the home team (actually, Taiwan were the home team, even though they weren&apos;t home), when Hirokazu Ibata (1.500 WBC OPS) came through with a clutch RBI base hit that tied the score at 2-2. Moments earlier, Takashi Toritani had stolen second to get into scoring position, which reminded me of Dave Roberts&apos; steal for Boston at Fenway against the Yankees in Game Four of the 2004 ALCS. Perhaps that&apos;s a bit of a stretch, but when I ran it by a friend of mine who is a Red Sox fan he informed me that Roberts was actually born in Okinawa and that his mom is Japanese. Go figure.  Japan took their first lead of the game in the 10th, and survived a two on, one out jam in the bottom of the inning, Toshiya Sugiuchi inducing a game ending double play to end, what was until Monday&apos;s Netherlands/Cuba contest, the game of the tournament, sending the crowd at the Big Egg into even greater hysterics (if that&apos;s possible).  Taiwan, a team that had looked like one of the best while playing at home in the first round, ran out of gas after the dramatic, crushing loss, getting pummeled by Cuba 14-0 in their next game. Still, Taiwan showed progress, with Chien-Ming Wang in particular standing out - the free agent tossed 12 scoreless WBC innings while seeking a new professional contract.  Japan are now rounding into form behind Kenta Maeda (2-0 0.00 ERA 15K 10IP), Ibata and Yoshio Itoi (1.066 OPS). They cracked a record-tying six home runs against the Netherlands in a statement 16-4 victory, crushing a team that helped oust South Korea and had beaten Cuba to boot. There&apos;s no reason to believe that Japan, despite having no MLB players on their roster, won&apos;t continue their WBC success at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco when they begin Championship Round play on March 17. Spaghetti Western In 2009 it was the Netherlands that shocked the WBC by getting out of the first round before ushering out the Dominican Republic. In 2013, the upset special are the Italians, who made themselves at home out in the Arizona desert. Their victory over Mexico set the stage for a second round appearance. Anthony Rizzo hit a two-run ninth inning double off Giants closer Sergio Romo to put them ahead. Then Jason Grilli, dealing at 96 MPH, in one of the tournaments many &quot;this ain&apos;t Spring Training moments&quot;, got out of a bases loaded jam to secure the upset win.  Italy followed the landmark victory by jumping all over Canada in a 14-4 rout, then taking a lead over the US into the fifth inning in their final Pool D game. Italy have been on the international baseball scene for sometime but have always played second fiddle to the Netherlands in Europe. Their second round berth marks a significant advance for the program, as does producing the likes of Alex Liddi, the first Italian raised player to reach the Majors. How much news their WBC efforts are making back home isn&apos;t clear, but La Gazzetta dello Sport did include WBC coverage, at least online. It featured the google translate quote of the tournament, which came from Canadian manager Ernie Whitt after their pummeling at the hands of the Azzurri. &quot;Italy has taken us a hot ass.&quot;  Venezuelans mourn Chavez and baseball Pool C made hardly a peep with the Dominican Republic cruising to a second round berth, with Puerto Rico also advanceding with a pair of wins while playing home at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan. Some in Venezuela still in mourning following the death of Hugo Chavez, who was a better baseball fan than pitcher, would have hoped for a bit of a pick me up from their national baseball team. Instead, they were eliminated quietly, sending home a talented squad that included Miguel Cabrera, Marco Scutaro, Pablo Sandoval, Elvis Andrus, Carlos Zambrano and Anibal Sanchez.  Honorable mention goes to Barry Larkin&apos;s Brazilian team that played well in their first WBC and actually had a 3-2 lead against Japan heading into the eighth inning of their game in Fukuoka.

While North Korea has abrogated the armistice at least seven times before, and much of drama in north-east Asia is ritually dismissed as rhetorical, there are genuine fears of an outbreak of hostilities. First, it has happened before. The events now could merely be a rerun of tensions four years ago when sanctions over missile and nuclear tests ended in a sea skirmish which Seoul claimed it won. Four months later, North Korea torpedoed and sank a South Korean warship, with the loss of 46 lives, and later that year shelled an island, after South Korea ignored a warning to cancel a live-fire artillery drill. The then South Korean president Lee Myung-bak got hammered for what was seen domestically as a slow and weak response. No such option is available to his successor Park Geun-hye. If the same happens again in disputed Yellow Sea waters, South Korea has vowed to hit back hard. Second, successful nuclear and missile tests may actually have empowered North Korean generals to think that the South would not dare to respond to another provocation. One analyst has compared this to the seatbelt effect. After seatbelts were introduced in cars, a Chicago University economist, Sam Peltzman, noted that many drivers used the additional safety provided by the belts to drive more recklessly. He called it risk substitution. The same might be about to happen now. When the North Korean army supreme command said on 5 March that it will &quot;make a strike of justice at any target any time as it pleases without limit&quot;, it might just mean it. Before we wander down the road of apocalyptic possibilities, it is worth noting what has not happened. For a country technically in a state of war with its neighbour, it is odd, to say the least, that it continues to allow 123 &quot;enemy&quot; companies to operate in a cross-border industrial zone employing over 50,000 of its workers. The hotline may have stopped working on Monday, but the flow of South Koreans trooping across the border to Kaesong was unimpeded on that day. The North has threatened to close the cross-border experiment, but so far it has not. More importantly, China has stopped backing its errant buffer state. It was one of the sponsors of the UN security council resolution that upgraded the sanctions from a request to an obligation. It is both frustrated and angry at North Korea&apos;s defiance, and \u2013 although China continually tells Japan it lacks leverage over North Korea \u2013 there is still much more it could do to make its displeasure felt. If any nuclear power succeeds in turning Kim Jong-un from his current course, it will be China. Which is why even media debates in South Korea and Japan about arming themselves with nuclear weapons are counterproductive. The key to solving the North Korean nuclear crisis remains Beijing. It will not be encouraged to do so by a nuclear arms race on its doorstep. That is also why the real cost of increasingly acerbic island disputes between the key regional powers China, Japan and South Korea is going up all the time. Other than endlessly repeating the historical arguments over sovereignty, which is a zero-sum game, a new UN-backed approach needs to be found which sidesteps the issue of ownership and concentrates instead on sharing and policing conservation of the sea around them. In the midst of this regional turmoil, Taiwan \u2013 to which the disputed island chain known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyutai in Taipei is closest and to which it is geologically linked \u2013 has the best solution. President Ma Ying-jeou has proposed a two-stage approach to solving the dispute between the three claimants, to which China has yet to respond. It should.

But let Ben Bajarin explain:   The problem when we talk about Android market share in both smartphones and tablets, is that we are not talking about market share in which a universal app store medium exists. This is because Android can be taken and forked, to the chagrin of Google, and used for the sole agenda of others thus not benefiting Google or the Play Store developers. This is the problem we have when we look at the Android growth in tablets. The greatest percentage of it is coming from Amazon with their Kindle fire, and the Chinese market. The Kindle Fire runs a forked version of Android and developers must use Amazon&apos;s SDK and proprietary app store. 90% of Chinese Android devices sold do not come with the Google Play store installed but rather have ties to dozens of local app store from local service providers. Therefore to get an accurate picture of the Android market, it is more helpful to break out market share by devices which have the Play store and the ones that do not. If we did, then IDC&apos;s, chart would look more like this.   It&apos;s a telling diagram. AOSP (forked non-Google Android) is huge - and lumping AOSP and Google Android together gives a false picture of what&apos;s going on. Trouble is, the AOSP numbers are very hard to acquire, despite being significant. Acer President: more comfortable about Windows 8 uptake due to Microsoft&apos;s support &gt;&gt; Fox Business  Acer President Jim Wong told the Wall Street Journal on the sidelines of a media event in Taipei that he expects sales of Windows 8 touch-based devices to pick up in the second half of the year. He declined to specify what support Microsoft has given Acer and PC makers. Several sources in Taiwan said Microsoft has recently offered steep discounts on Windows 8 to PC makers to boost development of touch-controlled devices.  Mr. Wong said the company&apos;s operating margin had already bottomed at 0.3% in the third quarter and is expected to rise this year. The company expects its tablet shipments to exceed 5m units this year, with a 50% chance of reaching 10m, boosted by strong demand for Acer&apos;s new low-cost tablet, the Iconia B1, he said.   What are the factors in that 50% each-way bet of hitting 10m? And of course those aren&apos;t PCs - they&apos;re tablets running Windows 8. Windows 8 device choices baffle buyers &gt;&gt; Information Week Kevin Casey:   [Forrester senior analyst David] Johnson added that the differences - both significant and subtle - between various Windows 8 models aren&apos;t always apparent to buyers until they&apos;ve had a chance to use the devices. A road warrior might be better suited for a device with a built-in keyboard instead of a true tablet, for example, but they might not figure that out until it&apos;s too late. &quot;This is something that we think many buyers will not fully grasp until after they&apos;ve made their purchase and have to live with their choice for the long term,&quot; Johnson said.  That lack of practical information is, in business-speak, a barrier to entry. I spoke recently with Terena Bell, CEO of the translation firm In Every Language, who explained why she&apos;d been impressed by Microsoft&apos;s extensive ad campaign behind the Windows 8 launch. Yet when she decided to plunk down her company&apos;s cash on a Windows 8 machine that would run upwards of $1,000, she was stumped by her hardware choices and had trouble finding reliable information and reviews. Microsoft&apos;s slick ads were both friend and enemy - they first got Bell interested in, and later confused by, Windows 8.  Eye-tracking tech will be open to iPhones and other devices &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com Brian Chen:   Samsung Electronics won&apos;t be the only company that gets a fancy eye-tracking feature. A start-up company called uMoove, which has been developing this type of technology for three years, says it will offer eye- and head-tracking to anyone, including device makers like Apple and software developers who make mobile apps.  Based in Israel, has been working on a technology for smartphones and tablets to track eye and head movements using a device&apos;s front-facing camera. It said on Tuesday that very soon it would offer a software tool kit to apply its technology to applications.  TripAdvisor reminds everyone why travel agencies are screwed &gt;&gt; Skift  A recent study conducted on behalf of TripAdvisor by independent research firm StrategyOne found that only 7% of Brits visited a high street travel agent to book their latest trip. Travelers in the UK and abroad now turn to web services as their primary booking tool. Brits were most likely to book via web-based travel agencies (27%) or directly on hotels&apos; own websites (23%).  The study also found the Internet to be the most useful to travelers when researching a trip. Travel review sites were regarded the most helpful with 38% of respondents choosing them as their top choice, but the data could be skewed given that it was administered by TripAdvisor.

Nonetheless, the ritual ballot by the country&apos;s legislature in the Great Hall of the People formally completes the succession. Since acceding to power, Mr Xi has produced one good speech, levered a liberal, Li Yuanchao (who had been passed over by Jiang Zemin for a place of the seven man standing committee), into the position of vice-president and launched a noisy campaign against corruption. There are conflicting assessments of how far and fast Mr Xi can go in turning around that great supertanker of state. It is debatable whether he has to. Since the start of the banking crisis, China&apos;s GDP has grown by 52.5%, as opposed to America&apos;s paltry 2.4 % or Britain&apos;s, which has slipped back four percentage points. Mr Xi&apos;s intentions will remain a political mystery, but more has emerged about Mr Xi the political package. He sets out with a number of advantages over his predecessors. The first is his knowledge of the outside world. Compared to Deng Xiaoping, or Hu Jintao, Mr Xi has travelled widely and often \u2013 he has made more than 50 trips abroad. Mr Xi is also more keenly aware than most Chinese leaders of those other 23 million people in Taiwan. The future leader spent 17 long years in Fujian province, from which many families on the island hail and which lies across the strait. There is nervousness in Taiwan that after the second term of President Ma Yingjeou ends, Beijing may be tempted to strongarm it to the political negotiating table, upsetting a status quo which has seen direct flights, tourism and trade blossom but has side-stepped the historic conflict over statehood. Mr Xi knows better than to push for measures that will backfire. Mr Xi is also in a better position than his predecessors with China&apos;s military and the party. His father, Xi Zhongxun, was a political commissar and revolutionary in the civil war. (Xi Jinping himself was secretary to a former minister of defence and served in the military.) A man of integrity, Mr Xi senior suffered three times for speaking out: imprisoned and tortured during the cultural revolution; forced from office after he spoke up for Hu Yaobang in 1987; and pushed into semi-retirement after opposing the military crackdown in Tiananmen Square two years later. None of this family baggage now hurts the son, who also did his time in a village in the cultural revolution. On the contrary, it is a plus. He counts some generals of the People&apos;s Liberation Army as longstanding friends. It is also been a long time since China has had a presentable first lady. But marriage to the folk singer Peng Liyuan has imbued China&apos;s leading couple with star quality \u2013 at least as much as the Obamas. But there is a more intriguing quality to the new leader&apos;s wife and his late father \u2013 their attraction to Buddhism. Mr Xi does not like to talk about this now. In August, Reuters news agency carried an interview with the Dalai Lama, in which he recalled his close relationship with the elder Xi, how the two of them swapped watches and sported them long after the Dalai Lama&apos;s flight to India. Tibetans still remember with relative fondness Mr Xi&apos;s father, who was attached to the North West Military region in Lanzhou . There are other intriguing hints from Mr Xi&apos;s not too distant biography. In April 2006, the World Buddhist Forum in Hangzhou and Zhoushan in Zhejiang province was heralded as the first major international religious conference to be organised since the founding of the People&apos;s Republic. Which official in Zhejiang pushed Beijing for it? Apparently, one Xi Jinping. None of this means that the militantly atheist party has a leader who is religious, that a historic meeting with the Dalai Lama is imminent, still less that a settlement is possible in Tibet. But the potential at the very least is there for a term of leadership that may yet surprise. Mr Xi is just starting out, but the omens are by no means all bad."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/18/argentina-president-falklands-pope", "publicationDate": "2013-03-18T19:08:38Z", "tags": ["Pope Francis", "Religion", "Catholicism", "Christianity", "The papacy", "World news", "Falkland Islands", "Americas", "UK news", "Argentina", "Robert Mugabe", "Zimbabwe", "Africa", "Vatican", "Kenneth Clarke", "Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s president, Ma Ying-Jeou, also made a rare European excursion to the only state on the continent with which it still has full diplomatic relations."], "title": "Argentina's president discusses Falkands with Pope Francis", "article": "The Argentinian president wasted no time in bringing up the divisive issue of the Falkland Islands when she met with her compatriot Pope Francis as he prepared for his inaugural papal mass. After they lunched together, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner told a press conference in Rome: &quot;I asked for his intervention to avoid problems that could emerge from the militarisation of Great Britain in the South Atlantic. We want a dialogue and that is why we asked the pope to intervene: so that the dialogue is successful.&quot; Britain reacted strongly to this attempt to involve the new pope in mediating in the increasingly tense dispute. The UK ambassador to the Vatican, Nigel Baker, said: &quot;The Holy See&apos;s position on the Falkland Islands has for some time been that it is a matter between two sovereign states and that the Holy See does not have a role to play. We expect that position to continue.&quot; Fern\u00e1ndez was one of many heads of state flying into Rome for Francis&apos;s inaugural papal mass on Tuesday. They included Zimbabwe&apos;s president, Robert Mugabe, who has repeatedly dodged a European travel ban by visiting the Vatican and the UN&apos;s Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation. Taiwan&apos;s president, Ma Ying-Jeou, also made a rare European excursion to the only state on the continent with which it still has full diplomatic relations. The most historically significant attendance will be that of Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader of the world&apos;s Orthodox Christians. His presence at the installation of Pope Francis will be the first by an ecumenical patriarch since before the Great Schism in 1054. In the week of the enthronement of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Britain sent a modest delegation. The Duke of Gloucester will represent his cousin, the Queen. Ken Clarke, minister without portfolio, and Lady Warsi, the minister for Faith and Communities, will be there on behalf of the government. Both Fern\u00e1ndez and the new pope did their best to bring some warmth to a relationship that was notably frosty when he was still archbishop of Buenos Aires. She gave Francis a gourd and straw with which to prepare the traditional South American infusion, mate. He responded with a kiss. &quot;Never in my life has a pope kissed me,&quot; Fern\u00e1ndez said afterwards. It was a far cry from last year when the then Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio declared that Argentina under her leadership was suffering from demagoguery, totalitarianism and corruption. She, at the time, described his attitudes as reminiscent of the middle ages and the inquisition. Fern\u00e1ndez and her late husband, Nestor Kirchner, who preceded her in office, have ignored Catholic teaching to introduce a series of measures such as the legalisation of same-sex marriages in 2010. A source close to her administration said of Bergoglio&apos;s election as pope: &quot;The government has been split over how to react.&quot; Francis&apos;s status as the first Latin American pope has appealed to nationalists across the region, including left-wing leaders such as acting president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela, Rafael Correa of Ecuador and Leonardo Boff, a key figure in Brazil&apos;s Liberation Theology movement. &quot;Cristina is worried that we cannot swim against the tide of affection,&quot; said the source. In Rome, Fern\u00e1ndez cited the precedent of Pope John Paul II&apos;s mediation in a potentially explosive territorial dispute between Chile and Argentina in 1978. Pope Francis&apos;s views on the Falklands dispute are the same as those of almost all Argentinians. At a mass last year to mark the 30th anniversary of the war, he said Argentina&apos;s troops had gone to the islands &quot;to claim the country that is theirs&quot;. He described the Falklands as &quot;usurped&quot;. Britain has rejected Fern\u00e1ndez&apos;s call for negotiations on sovereignty. This month all but three of the 1,518 islanders who voted in a referendum endorsed the prospect of the islands keeping their status as a UK overseas territory. At least 132 delegations are expected at the pope&apos;s inaugural mass. Italian media reports said the civil protection authorities were making provision for more than a million attendees. In Buenos Aires, there are clear signs that the government wants to narrow its distance from the new pope. Posters have gone up around the city with portraits of Francis and the slogan &quot;The new pope is Latin American and Peronist.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/mar/19/toyo-ito-pritzker-prize-architecture", "publicationDate": "2013-03-19T12:03:00Z", "tags": ["Architecture", "Japan", "Art and design", "Culture", "Awards and prizes", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["Photograph: designboom    His most ambitious project yet, currently on site in Taiwan, will represent the ultimate outcome of his organic modifications of the grid."], "title": "Toyo Ito: the 'dropout robot' who never tires of reinventing himself", "article": "When it was announced this week that Toyo Ito is to receive the 2013 Pritzker prize, the reaction of many was: &quot;Hasn&apos;t he already got it?&quot; The 71-year-old Japanese architect is long overdue the venerated gong, having built a consistently revolutionary body of work over the last 40 years, and whose office has already spawned a whole new generation of established Japanese architects \u2013 including Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa, of Sanaa, who won the Pritzker back in 2010. &quot;After a Chinese architect won last year and Sanaa three years ago, I did not expect it would be me this time,&quot; Ito told the LA Times, sharing others&apos; surprise. As the sixth architect from Japan to receive the award \u2013 following Kenzo Tange in 1987, Fumihiko Maki in 1993, Tadao Ando in 1995, and Sejima and Nishizawa \u2013 Ito is perhaps the hardest to pigeonhole. He has no house style, and his projects have veered dramatically between different techniques in a process of constant experimentation. Treating his office as an open laboratory, his employees are encouraged to pursue their own directions, and each project takes a radically new approach to developing a different kind of structural system, specific to the building, programme and site at hand. One of his earliest buildings, now demolished and much mourned for by architects, was the White U house in Tokyo, which he built for his sister and her daughters in 1976 after the death of her husband. It was a monolithic, tyrannical house \u2013 a contemplative tube of white space wrapped around a solitary courtyard in a U-shape. It turned its back on the world with high windowless walls, the interior spaces lit only by chinks of daylight. One by one, the family left the house, describing living in it as being &quot;imprisoned in a coffin&quot; \u2013 an attitude seemingly shared by their pets, who all refused to be alone in the enclosed courtyard. It is a project that might appear to sit unhappily with the Pritzker jury&apos;s citation that Ito&apos;s architecture &quot;projects an air of optimism, lightness and joy, and is infused with both a sense of uniqueness and universality&quot;. But a house for a mourning sister is a very different creature to a public library, and Ito designed one of the most transparent, open and uplifting of recent years in the city of Sendai in 2001. The culmination of a decade-long preoccupation with the effects of emerging digital technologies on architecture \u2013 which he has called &quot;the body of electronic modernism&quot; \u2013 the Sendai Mediatheque was his first substantial exercise in &quot;fluid space&quot;. A reinvention of Le Corbusier&apos;s domino house, the seven-storey glass box replaced columns with cores of woven tubes, threaded though the floors in clusters of worm-like capillaries. Their integrity was dramatically put to the test when the city became the epicentre of the Tohoku earthquake two years ago \u2013 the library remained standing, only suffering minor damage.            While the structure for Sendai was brought inside the building to liberate the facade, in other projects Ito has employed precisely the opposite strategy. His 2002 Serpentine Gallery Pavilion was purely an exercise in developing a structural skin around an empty box of space, its irregular diagonal lattice forming a bold graphic envelope. He did the same two years later for the Tod&apos;s store on Tokyo&apos;s Omotesando shopping street, using only a slender skin of concrete in an abstract pattern of tree branches. A concern with the organic has run through much of Ito&apos;s work, which often uses geometries from nature in order to battle against the prevailing forces of modernism. &quot;I thought of myself as a dropout robot,&quot; he has said (after initially naming his practice Urban Robot), styling himself as the iconoclast of his generation, the maverick inventor in a sea of uniformity. At a lecture entitled Liquid Space, given at Princeton in 2009 and transcribed in the book Forces of Nature, Ito describes how he has spent the last decade working against the generic grid imposed on our buildings and cities by 20th-century modernism. &quot;By modifying the grid slightly, I have been attempting to find a way of creating relationships that bring buildings closer to their surroundings and environment,&quot; he said.     Barbapapa house? A model of the Taichung Metropolitan Opera House. Photograph: designboom    His most ambitious project yet, currently on site in Taiwan, will represent the ultimate outcome of his organic modifications of the grid. The Taichung Metropolitan Opera House will stand like a vast sponge of a building, a 3D warren of cave-like spaces, connected vertically and horizontally in a labyrinth of smooth white walls that melt into floors which in turn melt into ceilings. It will be the closest we have come to a real-life Barbapapa house, and will look as if some amorphous creature had wriggled free of its concrete skin, leaving a network of cavernous voids.  So what can we expect next? No doubt another radical reinvention: &quot;When one building is completed, I become painfully aware of my own inadequacy, and it turns into energy to challenge the next project,&quot; he said this week in response to the announcement. &quot;I will never fix my architectural style and never be satisfied with my works.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/31/peta-ingrid-newkirk-making-fur-fly", "publicationDate": "2013-03-31T00:05:00Z", "tags": ["Animal welfare", "Animals", "Activism", "Protest", "Peta"], "sentences": ["I&apos;ve been in horse slaughterhouses, chicken, cow slaughterhouses, a dog slaughterhouse in Taiwan and none them wants to go down the ramp."], "title": "Peta's Ingrid Newkirk: making the fury fly", "article": "My favourite story about Ingrid Newkirk, the founder and head of Peta, the animal-rights organisation, involves her storming the dining room of the Four Seasons hotel in New York, depositing a dead raccoon on Anna Wintour&apos;s dinner plate and calling the veteran editor of American Vogue a &quot;fur hag&quot;. Wintour, a long-time Peta hate figure for her support of the fur industry, calmly covered it with a napkin and then ordered coffee. There are no raccoons \u2013 living or dead \u2013 when I meet Newkirk in her office in Washington DC, though her evangelical zeal doesn&apos;t seem to have dimmed. At times it feels less like interviewing the CEO of a $30m-a-year-foundation, one which boasts 360 employees and thousands of volunteers, than arguing the toss in the sixth-form common room. It&apos;s all so personal to her. Newkirk has been interviewed dozens of times over a 40-year-plus career. She&apos;s the head of the largest animal rights organisation in the world. And yet there&apos;s a quaver in her voice that on several occasions threatens to bring tears. There are accusations. There&apos;s more than a touch of suspicion. And, at times, outright hostility. This in response to asking what we in the journalistic trade call &quot;questions&quot;. &quot;Ingrid,&quot; I\u00a0say at one point, &quot;can we just leave the emotion out of it for a\u00a0moment, and concentrate on the figures?&quot; &quot;We can,&quot; she says. &quot;But it&apos;s so hard! It&apos;s hard if you care about animals.&quot; She might be one of the most infuriating subjects I&apos;ve ever interviewed, but no one could ever say of Newkirk that she doesn&apos;t care. She&apos;s devoted almost her entire adult life to defending the rights of animals and even though she&apos;s now 63, when I ask her if she has any plans to retire it&apos;s as if I&apos;d asked if she fancied a nice veal cutlet. &quot;No! Never. Peta is my life. It&apos;s everything to me.&quot; She&apos;s up before dawn, answering many of the 800 to 1,000 emails she gets a day personally, and although the encounter with Wintour was 20 years ago, it seems emblematic: they&apos;re both formidable Englishwomen of a certain age. They&apos;ve both imprinted their personalities on the American institutions they&apos;ve led. And they both acutely understand the power of the visual image. Newkirk, however, is by far the less well known. Yet there&apos;s no denying the impact she&apos;s had on the world of animal rights, animal testing, factory farming and fur wearing, not to mention celebrity endorsements, and what can only be described as the use of shock and awe in advertisements. It&apos;s because of Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) that we&apos;re faced with an almost daily onslaught of celebrities taking their clothes off for some cause or another. Peta started the craze way back in 1994 when it photographed five supermodels, including Naomi Campbell, minus their clothes, with the caption: &quot;We&apos;d rather go naked than wear fur.&quot; Campbell, of course, being the principled idealist that she is, went on to wear fur about two seconds later. &quot;I\u00a0had to sack her,&quot; says Newkirk. &quot;We let it go the first two times because she said it was a\u00a0mistake, but the third time I got the call I said: &apos;Just sack her.&apos;&quot; Still, the campaign has run and run. &quot;And everyone has followed our example. That movie Calendar Girls would never have been made if we hadn&apos;t done what we&apos;d done. Everyone does it now, but at the time it was just a silly gimmick we came up with.&quot;     Skin deep: Emma Sjoberg, Tatjana Patitz, Heather Stewart Whyte, Fabienne Terwinghe and Naomi Campbell in an anti-fur campaign for Peta (1994). Photograph: Rex Features    A silly gimmick that propelled Peta on to the pages of every broadsheet, tabloid and celebrity magazine in the world, and which it has never left. It was one of the first non-profits to really &quot;get&quot; celebrity, and that is still a\u00a0major plank of its strategy. Its latest film shows Joaquin Phoenix drowning, an image designed to draw attention to the plight suffered by fish. Peta tried to buy airtime during the ad breaks in the Oscars to show the film, but the network banned it. The film represents Peta&apos;s signature cocktail of graphic imagery, celebrity firepower and sniff of controversy \u2013 though it is pretty mild stuff by its past standards, which include poster campaigns comparing people who eat chickens to Nazis, factory farming to the Holocaust, the Westminster Dog Show (the American version of Crufts) to the Ku Klux Klan, and dog breeders to slave traders. Subtle it is not. Is it Peta&apos;s strategy to upset everyone, I\u00a0ask Newkirk. &quot;No,&quot; she says. &quot;Our mission is to provoke thought. People have been taught to disregard what happens to pigs or chickens, to not think about the suffering they go through. Our job is to make them think. We&apos;re not out to be popular.&quot; Still, there&apos;s something impressive about the scope of the targets, ie pretty much everyone. I tell Newkirk I was amused by the game J-Lo Fur Bully on the Block in which players had to help animals escape from Jennifer Lopez before they&apos;re turned into a coat or a pair of shoes. &quot;Oh yes. We have lots of things like that. Have you seen Cooking Mama? That&apos;s bigger than all the others combined.&quot; Is that the one where Mommy is a murderer, I ask her. It&apos;s a parody of a\u00a0Nintendo game which shows a\u00a0mother beheading animals to give to her children for dinner. &quot;Yes.&quot; Do mommies not get a bit cross about that? &quot;Of course they do. So they should stop being murderers.&quot; And then there are rather gleeful ad campaigns, including one that claimed a link between autism and milk. But it&apos;s based on such a tiny number of studies, I suggest. &quot;Yes, there are only a\u00a0small number of studies,&quot; says Newkirk. &quot;But that doesn&apos;t discount it.&quot; It&apos;s hardly a scientific consensus. &quot;I&apos;m not looking for a\u00a0consensus. I&apos;m looking for thought provoking.&quot; Isn&apos;t that just bad science? &quot;It&apos;s not bad science. There&apos;s a link. Read the studies. Decide yourself. But every day people are told to drink milk, how it builds strong bones and so on. We don&apos;t have millions and millions of pounds to brainwash people so we have our gimmicky thing. Hello! Milk has been linked to autism.&quot; And then there&apos;s her claim that &quot;it&apos;s incontrovertible that not eating meat or dairy prolongs your life.&quot; Is it incontrovertible, I ask? You can be a\u00a0pretty unhealthy vegetarian. &quot;There&apos;s study after study!&quot; &quot;But are they comparing like with like? Is a heart-healthy, low-fat diet which also contains a small component of meat really going to kill you first?&quot; &quot;Fine. Then do it for ethical reasons. Do it for environmental reasons. We&apos;re not a health organisation.&quot; There&apos;s something maddening about arguing with Ingrid Newkirk, but then she&apos;s a\u00a0provocateur. It&apos;s what she does. And it&apos;s what Peta, built in her image, does. It&apos;s why battery chickens are depicted in concentration camps and why last year she launched a legal case that named five Orcas as plaintiffs and sued SeaWorld for enslavement. (It failed, but she&apos;s surprisingly upbeat about it. The judge, she says, didn&apos;t simply throw it out, as he could have done. He was very &quot;respectful&quot; and heard the lawyers out. &quot;It failed, but all the slavery cases fail when they&apos;re first brought.&quot;) Newkirk&apos;s argument is that if you&apos;re against slavery, it doesn&apos;t matter who is being enslaved. She is completely confident that one day we will look back on this as the dark ages. And, when she gets in full spate, describing the way that chickens are crushed en route to slaughter, their wings broken, the pain and inhumane conditions that they suffer, I find it hard to deny that she has a point. What have you made of the horsemeat scandal, I ask her, and her eyes light up. &quot;There&apos;s this sentimental view that we don&apos;t want to eat horse. I&apos;ve been in horse slaughterhouses, chicken, cow slaughterhouses, a dog slaughterhouse in Taiwan and none them wants to go down the ramp. They all kick. They all struggle. They&apos;re all petrified. It&apos;s purely sentimental.&quot; Would it have been better if we&apos;d found puppy dogs in our burgers? &quot;Oh God, yes. That would have been wonderful!&quot;     Force fed: Ingrid Newkirk with a funnel of feed in her mouth as she protests against the sale of foie gras. Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP    INGRID NEWKIRK was born in England but spent the early years of her life being shifted from one school to another: Hertfordshire, the Orkney Islands, France, and finally India and a\u00a0convent school in the Himalayas which was all cold showers and abusive nuns. In the holidays, however, she&apos;d help her mother in her work with the lepers, or the unmarried mothers, or the orphans. &quot;She would literally have given you the shirt off her back. And she&apos;s always said it&apos;s not who suffers, it&apos;s how they suffer. And I&apos;ve carried that with me my whole life.&quot; She has. Newkirk&apos;s most oft-quoted statement and the encapsulation of her world view is that &quot;a rat is a pig is a dog is a boy&quot;. Although initially her plan, after moving with the family to the States, was to become a stockbroker. And then she had the encounter that would change her life. It&apos;s one of Peta&apos;s founding myths. She discovered a litter of abandoned kittens and took them to the animal pound where a worker told her that she&apos;d &quot;take care of them&quot;. &quot;I asked if I could see the kennels and they said, go on back. And I\u00a0got to the end and there were the kittens that I&apos;d brought in: all killed. It was all just so callous. &quot;The place was filthy. And the way they&apos;d been killed was so awful. So I went to England and said, if you have to destroy animals how do you do it? I decided that if it had to be done, it has to be done without pain and suffering.&quot; At first, Newkirk worked within the system. She became an animal-protection officer, then (after moving to America) Washington&apos;s first female poundmaster and finally the head of the animal-disease-control division of the District of Columbia Commission on Public Health. It&apos;s still a long step from there to stripping off naked in Times Square, as Newkirk once did, and writing a will which states her desire, after her death, that her flesh is barbecued and her skin turned into wallets. That step came when she met Alex Pacheco in 1980. She was 31. He was a student and it was he who introduced her to the work of the philosopher Peter Singer, considered by many to be the father of the animal rights movement. &quot;I&apos;d been voted one of the Washingtonians of the year and I\u00a0wrote a little speech and I\u00a0said it&apos;s not just dogs and cats and horses. It&apos;s all animals. They have communication, they have feelings, they can feel joy, love and pain and all the senses and experiences \u2013 and yet what we are taught as children is to be kind to the dog and eat the pig, and that makes no sense biologically or in any way. It&apos;s not a rational concept. &quot;People aren&apos;t doing it out of malice. I had my first fur coat at 19. My favourite meat was liver!&quot; says Newkirk. Nobody&apos;s favourite meal is liver, I say. &quot;I love liver! Liver and onions!&quot; We don&apos;t have liver and onions for our lunch, funnily enough. Instead a fresh-faced young minion \u2013 there seems to be an endless supply of them in the Peta offices \u2013 brings us a healthy vegan lunch, though we&apos;re too busy spatting back and forth to get round to eating it.     Ingrid Newkirk and rescue rabbit Electra Photograph: Stephen Voss for the Observer    Ingrid Newkirk and Pacheco&apos;s first coup was to infiltrate and secretly film an animal-testing lab. The footage showed monkeys being horribly abused, and it went around the world. Peta was born. It now has more than two million members and a string of major successes including a ban on animals being used in crash tests worldwide, persuading major US cosmetics firms not to test beauty products on animals, and persuading McDonald&apos;s and, later, Burger King to introduce animal-welfare regulations. It&apos;s been highly successful but, like its founder, it has certain idiosyncrasies, one of which is that it operates an animal shelter in Virginia and last year put down 87% of the animals that came into its care. Look on the internet and you&apos;ll find outraged animal rights activists accusing Peta of being murderers. Why? &quot;Because they are unwanted. Because they are sick. The question ought to be why does anyone think an animal rights group would put animals down?&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I say. &quot;I think it befuddles people. They don&apos;t understand it.&quot; &quot;Look at the website! Look at the photos of these creatures! Read the case studies! They&apos;re poor, suffering animals. It&apos;s the only humane thing to do.&quot; But that&apos;s only a small sample. What about the others? &quot;Well, of course there&apos;s just a sample \u2013 there&apos;s not space for them all.&quot; So of the 1,800 which came in last year. They were all sick and poorly? &quot;Yes, if they&apos;re adoptable we don&apos;t take them in by and large. We send them to another shelter. We work in lower Virginia and upper North Carolina in total poverty pockets in what look like shanty towns in South Africa. We do the dregs work; we do the work no one else wants to do. It takes some gall to criticise us for that!&quot; Yet the number you put down, in one small area of the United States, is one third of the number that animal organisations put down in the entire UK last year. &quot;You can&apos;t compare it! No one should dare to take a shot at us for what we do! They should come down and see our clinics and see what we have to deal with! The heartbreak of it. These are websites set up by the meat and dairy industry.&quot; Not all of them. &quot;Not all of them. But what should we do? Turn our backs? In our own backyard? I won&apos;t do it. I can&apos;t.&quot; She is glaring at me from the other side of her desk. &quot;Ingrid,&quot; I say. &quot;Can you not understand that there is a difficulty for people conceptually with what you are doing. You are out to save the animals. And here you are killing them?&quot; &quot;There are no homes!&quot; she replies. &quot;There aren&apos;t enough homes for the adoptable dogs let alone these ones. God you&apos;re so naive \u2013 it&apos;s disturbing.&quot; Oh well, maybe. And she&apos;s genuinely outraged at the idea that anyone would think they weren&apos;t doing their best for the animals. When things have calmed down a bit she admits that even within the organisation not everyone agrees with her. But there&apos;s no doubting her sincerity. She reminds me of the character at the end of JM Coetzee&apos;s novel, Disgrace, who finds a sort of redemption in giving unwanted animals a peaceful death. It&apos;s so key to who she is and what she does. She&apos;s not religious, but it almost seems to be a sort of grace that she finds in alleviating suffering \u2013 by whatever means. When it&apos;s time to go, she insists I take my vegan bacon sandwich with me. It&apos;s my first encounter with a fake meat substitute, but what can I say? It&apos;s actually quite delicious.

Gerard Ryle, ICIJ&apos;s director, obtained the small black box as a result of his three-year investigation of Australia&apos;s Firepower scandal, a case involving offshore havens and corporate fraud. The hard drive contained more than 260 gigabytes, the equivalent of half a million books. Its files included 2m emails, four large databases. There were details of more than 122,000 offshore companies or trusts, and nearly 12,000 intermediaries (agents or &quot;introducers&quot;). Unlike the smaller cache of US cables and war logs passed in 2010 to WikiLeaks, the offshore data was not structured or clean, but an unsorted collation of internal memos and instructions, official documents, emails, large and small databases and spreadsheets, scanned passports and accounting ledgers. Analysing the immense quantity of information required &quot;free text retrieval&quot; software, which can work with huge volumes of unsorted data. Such high-end systems have been sold for more than a decade to intelligence agencies, law firms and commercial corporations. Journalism is just catching up. The named people who administered offshore companies included shareholders, directors, secretaries, lawyers, accountants, nominees and trustees. But many of such structures were simply legal devices designed to conceal. The real beneficial owners proved often to be the so-called &quot;settlors&quot; or &quot;protectors&quot; of offshore trusts, and those holding legal powers of attorney which enable them to exert secret control over the bank accounts. China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Russian Federation and former Soviet republics appeared to provide the majority of secret offshore owners. The British Virgin Islands are the second-largest source of capital investment in China \u2013 on paper at least. Cyprus, an offshore island currently in financial crisis as a result, is also identified in the data as a huge source of Russian investment. ICIJ&apos;s collaborating journalists from 46 countries constituted one of the largest groups ever to have worked together on a data project. Interestingly, the team&apos;s attempts to use encrypted email systems such as PGP (&quot;Pretty Good Privacy&quot;) were abandoned because of complexity and unreliability that slowed them down. Meanwhile, computer programmers in Germany, the UK and Costa Rica also designed sophisticated data mining and cleaning software for ICIJ. Manual analysis in New Zealand proved crucial in early decisions on what countries ICIJ needed reporters. ICIJ&apos;s own search system \u2013 named Interdata \u2013 was developed by a British programmer as dozens of new journalists joined the expanding project. Interdata allowed them to download copies of those of the 2.5m offshore documents relevant to their countries. ICIJ rebuilt some of the databases in an effort to run them in their original format. There were surprises. The databases were formatted to record who really lay behind each entity, as required by international regulations on money laundering and &quot;due diligence&quot;. Journalists hoped the truth was just a click away. In fact, entries for &quot;beneficial owners&quot; were often empty. The offshore agencies had frequently passed off their supposed legal responsibility to intermediaries in other countries. The lesson was that the empty fields were not an accident; it was the design. Only occasionally would an alert screen pop up, giving contact details for the persons who really owned the assets. ICIJ&apos;s fundamental lesson therefore had to be patience and perseverance. But persistently following leads through incomplete data yielded some great rewards: not just occasional and unexpected top names, but also the inside details of many nuanced and complex schemes for hiding wealth. \u2022 Duncan Campbell was the data journalism manager for the ICIJ project."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/04/lululemon-chief-product-officer-yoga", "publicationDate": "2013-04-04T19:08:00Z", "tags": ["Retail industry", "Yoga", "US news", "Business", "Fashion", "World news", "Amanda Holden"], "sentences": ["Lululemon has been working with the fabric company Eclat since 2004 to manufacture the luon fabric, which is made in Vietnam and Taiwan."], "title": "Lululemon chief product officer steps down over see-through yoga pants", "article": "The notorious see-through yoga pants which rocked apparel retailer Lululemon last month and cost it up to $17m in revenue seems to have claimed another victim as the company announced on Wednesday that its chief product officer will step down. Nearly 20% of the company&apos;s stock of high end-pants, which can cost up to $100, were pulled from stores in March after the fabric used was deemed too transparent. Sheree Waterson, who has worked for the company since 2008 and in retail for more than 25 years, will leave the company on April 15, the company said in a statement. Separately Lululemon announced that the &quot;unacceptable level of sheerness&quot; displayed by the black luon pants was caused by incomplete testing protocols. Multiple store managers had raised concerns over the fabric quality of the pants in early March, and the company decided to pull 17% of its stock from shelves because they did not meet their standards. Lululemon has been working with the fabric company Eclat since 2004 to manufacture the luon fabric, which is made in Vietnam and Taiwan. Improvements are underway with a new process including &quot;rigorous testing&quot; and revised standards for fabric tolerances, stretch and weight. Early reports from the company warned of flagging sales because of the pants shortage. In a March 21 earnings call the company predicted lost revenue between $12m and $17m in the first quarter because of the fabric issues. The company expects the losses to continue into the first half of 2013, estimating lost revenue between $57m and $67m.  After learning about the problem, pants were pulled from shelves, showrooms and websites. Customers who purchased the pants after 1 March could return the pants for a full refund or an exchange.  &quot;Our stand for differentiation is the quality of our product.

Their clear, easy-to-use website includes a wide range of blogs; a dedicated Tate Channel of artist video interviews and short films; and no fewer than 16 apps. These are mostly free, and range from the educational, such as the Tate Guide to Modern Art Terms, to the just-for-fun: the Muybridgizer allows you to create an Eadweard Muybridge-style animation using your iPhone camera. Most apps are only available for iPad and iPhone, but Tate is slowly developing availability for Android: I downloaded their guide to the current Roy Lichtenstein show at Tate Modern to my Samsung smartphone, and flicked through a selection of his paintings and scrapbooks from my desk. Brilliant. 10/10 Museum of Modern Art, New York MoMA&apos;s well-designed website has a multimedia channel hosting &quot;walkthroughs&quot; of exhibitions, blogs and a strong social media presence. The gallery also has free apps for iPhone, iPad and Android. I tested the latter, and enjoyed the audio tours of each floor: many of the gallery&apos;s masterpieces, such as Van Gogh&apos;s Starry Night and Edvard Munch&apos;s The Scream, are presented with a curator&apos;s audio guide. There&apos;s a dedicated kids&apos; section, too; the Art Lab iPad app lets you design your own artworks in the style of those in the MoMA collection. 9/10 Best for audio guides Louvre, Paris The world&apos;s biggest museum has an audio guide available as an app for both iPhone and Android. The latter costs \u00a32.17, but it&apos;s worth it: an authoritative English voice steers you around the gallery, pausing to admire such treasures as the Venus de Milo and the Mona Lisa. It&apos;s designed to be used while visiting the museum, but is just as good from a distance. A free iPad app, Louvre HD, meanwhile features hundreds of artworks, arranged by century. The pictures are stunning, though there&apos;s no video or audio commentary, and the background music is on the tacky side (there&apos;s a limit to the number of times you can hear Pachelbel&apos;s Canon). 8/10 Prado, Madrid There are several apps associated with the Prado, though none seem to be officially endorsed by the museum. I tried an audio guide app for Android, made by the art publishers Stendhal \u2013 who also make apps for several other Spanish galleries, including Madrid&apos;s Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza. It costs \u00a31.58, and features audio commentary on about 25 works from the Prado&apos;s collection, including Bosch&apos;s The Garden of Earthly Delights and Venus and Adonis by Paolo Veronese. Bizarrely, there are no photographs, so only worth downloading if you are visiting the gallery. 5/10 Best for sheer beauty     Truly innovative ... Robert Rauschenberg in his studio. Photograph: Burton Berinsky/Time & Life Pictures/Getty Image    Gagosian galleries, worldwide The gorgeous Gagosian app for iPad is free, and updated four times a year with multimedia packages about the exhibitions in the 12 Gagosian galleries. In the current issue, a video introduction to the Robert Rauschenberg show at the Madison Avenue gallery in New York has director Ealan Wingate describing a 1962 photograph of Rauschenberg in his Broadway studio. Artworks leap off the wall, complete with captions, as Wingate speaks. Truly innovative. 10/10 National Palace Museum, Taipei This museum in Taiwan has a nifty English-language website: themed microsites, on subjects such as Chinese flower painting, offer a window onto the museum&apos;s huge collection of ancient Chinese artefacts \u2013 several of which you can view in 3D. The free iPad app offers tours of selected gallery floors, timelines, and hundreds of beautiful photographs. 8/10 Most deceptive &quot;free&quot; app The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg The grand Russian museum&apos;s multiplatform app is free \u2013 but all you get is a floorplan and some basic information about the gallery&apos;s history. To see any actual art, you have to download &quot;additions&quot; priced between 64p and \u00a32.60. Still, \u00a32.60 does get you a full &quot;virtual visit&quot;, with 100 amazing 3D panoramas, and descriptions of individual artworks. 6/10 Least digitally savvy The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York America&apos;s largest art gallery has a serviceable website: its &quot;MetMedia&quot; channel features a jazz band performing inside the Temple of Dendur, and a fascinating film about the preservation of an ancient Persian carpet. But the museum has created surprisingly few apps \u2013 the only one I could find was Murder at the Met, a murder-mystery adventure for smartphones, set in the museum&apos;s American Wing in 1899. 5/10 Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin To be fair, the website for this stunning &quot;temple of light and glass&quot;, designed by Mies van der Rohe, does say it is &quot;being given a facelift&quot;. But still, it&apos;s bizarre that the gallery has taken this long to overhaul its dull, multimedia-free site. You can view images of the gallery&apos;s collection, alongside Berlin&apos;s other major museums, in a centralised digital section. But there are no apps, no blogs, and no social media engagement. 3/10 Most lost in translation Uffizi Gallery, Florence The official website is reasonably useful when it comes to booking tickets \u2013 and there&apos;s a virtual tour of the gallery, made with the Google Art Project. But the English commentary on its Android app is barely comprehensible (sample: &quot;The Gallery of the Uffizi is an extraordinary container of paintings ... from the 1200s until the days ours&quot;), and neither the virtual tour, nor most of the links, seem to work. 2/10 Best for accessibility Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest It&apos;s surprising how few galleries have cottoned on to the potential of apps for deaf and disabled visitors. Budapest&apos;s Museum of Fine Arts is getting ahead of the game: last week, the gallery unveiled an app called Sz\u00e9pMu SL (Sign-Language), aimed at deaf visitors. Available for Android, iPhone and iPad, it features videos in several international sign languages about 150 paintings from the museum&apos;s collections, with an interactive map. 9/10 Best interactive sites     Thanks to the V&A, you can now make your own Kylie Minogue paper doll. Photograph: Chrisse Goodwin/Darenote LTD    Victoria and Albert Museum, London The V&amp;A is fast catching up on Tate. The V&amp;A Channel on its website features films about items in its collection, and celebrity interviews from private views. There&apos;s also a &quot;things to do at home&quot; section, for those who fancy making a Kylie Minogue paper doll. Among the V&amp;A&apos;s great range of multi-platform apps, I liked Hollywood Camera for iPad: upload a photo of yourself, dress in outfits from last year&apos;s Hollywood costume show, and share them on Facebook and Twitter. 10/10 Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh This museum in Warhol&apos;s home city has several free apps available, including DIY: Pop for iPhone and iPad, which allows you to create your own Warhol-style silkscreen print and share it online. The app guides you carefully through each step, giving a real insight into the artist&apos;s process. 8/10 \u2022 This article was amended on 9 April 2013 to remove the assertion that the Uffizi is the home of Michelangelo&apos;s David.

Until then, shipbuilding had been primarily about steelworking skills. Offshore exploration required complex electrical systems and the yard had won a major contract. Peter asked what his new role entailed and was told: &quot;If it has got a wire in it, it&apos;s yours.&quot; The contract was for the Stena Seawell, the first in a series of vessels with electrical propulsion, computerised monitoring of machinery and high-voltage supply systems. Peter worked the huge crane ship ITM Challenger and the &quot;red fleet&quot; of 14 Superflex ferries, the last big order before the government&apos;s closure, announced in 1988, of NESL, which had been regarded as the most advanced shipbuilding outfit in the world. Born in Whitburn, near Sunderland, Peter started work as a technical apprentice or &quot;can boy&quot; at Sunderland Forge and Engineering. As the company diversified from supplying local shipyards, he worked as a contract engineer on the Thames Barrier and on projects for the burgeoning shipbuilding industries in Taiwan and Korea. He joined Terasaki UK on Clydeside in 1993 as engineering manager. For the next 20 years, he developed and patented new products, relishing the contact his work brought with the marine industry all over the world. His work often took him to Terasaki&apos;s headquarters in Osaka, Japan. Peter became well known for his presentations and had been due to give a keynote lecture for Lloyd&apos;s Register in Amsterdam. He believed a return to manufacturing and engineering skills was vital to Britain&apos;s future.

Watching brief on this one. How a trickle of BYOD costs can turn into a deluge &gt;&gt; CITEworld  Invariably, the carriers give bigger discounts to these larger companies than what they grant to a single customer. They also offer different types of plans that allow the business users to roam internationally at greatly reduced rates -- sometimes even at a fixed rate. This compares to the $1-per-minute voice costs and $10 per 10MB that many individual users pay for when abroad. These numbers vary based on the size of the company, but it represents significant savings over what many companies are paying for today for personally liable devices. As each person who participates in BYOD does his or her own expenses, the cost difference doesn&apos;t seem like a lot. It&apos;s a slow leak, $10 or $20 a month. If an employee travels overseas only occasionally, you never really notice the $100 bill for roaming that he or she submits. It didn&apos;t seem like an issue; after all, the employee had to get business accomplished.  Wouldn&apos;t businesses set up its own numbers (using virtual numbers) for the phones, and control the costs there?

The weird thing is, Xbox doesn&apos;t seem interested in fighting it.

He says Apple could release a new iPhone with multiple screen sizes this year. &quot;After our meeting with a tech-supply chain company, we walked away with the view that Apple will release the iPhone 5S in at least two screen sizes this summer and possibly three,&quot; says White. He&apos;s on the seventh day of a tour of technology suppliers in China and Taiwan. Apple has been criticized for not making the iPhone&apos;s screen bigger. It made it taller last year, expanding the screen to 4in, up from 3.5in, but it&apos;s not enough. Compared to Samsung and HTC which make phones with 5in, and 4.7in screens, the iPhone feels pretty tiny. For some people, that&apos;s great. For other people, it would be nice to have a big iPhone.  Apple already makes the iPhone in two screen sizes. Or does he mean three sizes?

Six months ago Taiwanese and Japanese coastguard cutters were drenching each other in spray from water cannon, in footage now forgotten. The present pantomime, with hisses greeting North Korea as the villain, is not a replacement of the fountain show but its encore. The Senkaku islands, if you&apos;re Japanese \u2013 Diaoyu if you&apos;re Chinese \u2013 halfway between the two countries, and the fossil resources that underlie them, are the issue of contention, not the integrity of the Korean border. In the twilight of oil, long-term energy security is at the top of all great powers&apos; agendas, but it has a highly personal dimension for those in power in China today. Two hundred dollars for a barrel of oil and 15% unemployment will lose a presidential election in America. In China, it could lose you your life, or at least, for sure, all its luxurious trappings. Continued growth and rising standards of living \u2013 with the oil to guarantee it \u2013 are vital to protect the family positions of the unpopular hereditary elite who run the country today. In order to have their subjects acquiesce to their rule, the princelings need to keep the economy booming and the good times rolling, not just for China&apos;s nouveau riche but for the emergent middle-classes and the migrant factory workers from the sticks who are bottom of the heap. It was possible to shoot university students and the residents of the capital in 1989. Unrest in the provinces to which laid-off factory workers would have to return would be a more serious matter altogether. The notion of North Korea having any autonomy in its external dealings and, as a prodigal son, somehow going further than China would want is more than ridiculous. The reprimands and tut-tuttings from China go further than that \u2013 they are a preposterous farce. North Korea is China&apos;s attack dog. The leash is the weapons, the food and the fuel that go over the border. China has had absolute control over the North since the day its troops turned the tide of war by launching infantry attacks against UN forces in November 1950. China has the capacity to install whoever it wishes in Pyongyang. The savage attack dog of the North has very large fangs in the shape of its million-plus land army. It can bark, show its teeth, even snap at the heels of its owner, but in the end both know who is master. North Korea is not even a client regime of Beijing, but a special autonomous region, with nuclear weapons and concentration camps rather than skyscrapers and the rule of law. Nevertheless, if the mobilisations and sabre-rattling are taking place within a tea cup, the storm is brewing not in a dainty Chinese thimble cup but a hefty mug. North Korea has done some terrible things, now largely forgotten. Young Kim Jong-un is going to have a hard time living down to them. The bombing of Korean Air Flight 858 in 1987 palled next to the earlier bomb attack in 1983 on the South Korean cabinet in Rangoon, Burma. Three South Korean cabinet ministers died, including the much-loved foreign minister, who rejoiced in the name Lee Bum Suk (He used to introduce himself, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I am the South Korean foreign minister and my name is Lee Bum Suk. Now please laugh.&quot;) He knew humour was anathema to the pretensions of dictators. The problem is not with the leadership in the North \u2013 ultimately rational, prioritising self-preservation and aggrandisement \u2013 but with the minions in a military that is now factionalised as never before. Brainwashing is a word that dates from the Korean war. The population of the North is not just docile but stupefied with terror. The crew of a North Korean submarine that ran aground in Southern waters in 1996 executed 11 of its own members for incompetence (read, fear for themselves and their own families) before making a run for the demilitarised zone, but only two survived. It is perfectly possible for someone so lobotomised by the cult of personality to push a button that was never meant to be pushed. North Korea naturally has some kind of agenda independent of China. Ratcheting up a situation such as today&apos;s consolidates the hold over the army of the young leader, Kim Jong-un. Like the frog that puffed itself up, it also makes him look larger on the world stage. The desire for a personal telephone call from Barack Obama would be puerile if the potential fallout \u2013 literal and figurative \u2013 were not so deadly. This grandson of Kim Il-sung also finds himself facing, in the new South Korean leader, the daughter of Park Chung-hee, the cold warrior and assassinated military dictator of the South between 1961 and 1979. (The head of his own secret service did him in.) Family business is being settled, with Kim Jong-un desiring to show himself as intransigent as his father and grandfather. Finally, Kim believes that a certain amount of obstreperousness will, as in the past, ease sanctions and bring a resumption of aid. The majority of South Koreans are still relatively blase. Not so in Japan, where the public is genuinely edgy. They have had three nuclear disasters already: two in war, one in peacetime. They did not fight in the Korean war, but Japanese civilians were abducted from their streets and homes by North Korean kidnappers and held in Korea for decades. Kim is a real bogeyman in Japan. Yet he needs to be careful he does not get a chopstick straight through the heart. To perceive Japan as something of a diplomatic and military soft touch would be a catastrophic error. The Japanese self-defence force and, in particular, the navy and coastguard \u2013 whose ratings, in full anti-flash gear, did not hesitate to sink a North Korean spyship with gunfire in 2001 \u2013 constitute a formidable obstacle. Japan has amassed enough plutonium to make as many bombs as China. The Japanese public genuinely abhors nuclear weapons, and, under the constitution, these are explicitly banned from Japanese shores. Nevertheless, if Japan does not already possess an arsenal of hydrogen bombs, they can be put together very rapidly. Barring misadventure \u2013 always possible when delinquent children play with firecrackers \u2013 a real shooting war is out of the question. Basically, what we have now is very heated bargaining in an Asian mall selling pirated goods. Japan wants as large a share of the Diaoyu oil as possible; China wants to concede as little as possible. In the end, Japan will be prepared to play second fiddle to China, as it has done to the United States for half a century, while the Americans will be bought off with lucrative contracts for service companies such as Halliburton. As for the deposits in the South China Sea, America has a very poor record of loyalty to its defeated allies. The Philippines, Taiwan and Malaysia can expect to be sold out if China takes the fields by brute force. The so-called pivot to the Pacific cannot work: this is China&apos;s backyard. It&apos;s as forlorn as it would be for a Chinese armada to steam to the Gulf of Mexico to secure its oil wells or to land in the Cayman islands. The real drama is going to be an Israeli attack on Iran \u2013 100 times more likely than the curtain rising in Korea. The implication is that the more conciliatory and moderate the west is over the shadow puppet-show and dress rehearsal playing out in the Orient, the more it can justify extreme measures against Iran. This is what we should be concerned about."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/11/htc-profit-slump-samsung-apple-smartphone", "publicationDate": "2013-04-11T18:23:04Z", "tags": ["HTC", "Smartphones", "Business", "Technology", "Samsung", "Mobile phones", "Telecoms", "iPhone", "Apple"], "sentences": ["The divergent fortunes within the $200bn (\u00a3130bn) global smartphone market were laid bare this week when Taiwan&apos;s HTC reported a 98% slump in profits, confirming Samsung and Apple&apos;s seemingly unassailable lead over their rivals."], "title": "HTC profit slump confirms Samsung and Apple as smartphone leaders", "article": "The divergent fortunes within the $200bn (\u00a3130bn) global smartphone market were laid bare this week when Taiwan&apos;s HTC reported a 98% slump in profits, confirming Samsung and Apple&apos;s seemingly unassailable lead over their rivals. In 2010, HTC was the world&apos;s biggest maker of smartphones that used Google&apos;s Android operating system. Now it has joined two other former titans, Nokia and BlackBerry, in a desperate search for profit and growth. As HTC reported a slump in first-quarter profits to \u00a30.9m, Samsung Electronics, the world&apos;s largest maker of mobile phones and smartphones, was basking in a forecast that its quarterly operating profit would be around 8.7trn (\u00a35bn). The market is splitting into three tiers that allow only for high-end products in developed markets, a bevy of barely profitable products in the middle, and a hugely competitive low-cost segment in developing markets such as China. In the last quarter of 2012, the last period for which figures are available, Apple and Samsung together shipped 111.5m smartphones, according to researcher IDC. That&apos;s more than 50% of a market that has tripled in volume over that time \u2013 and compares to a combined share of less than 20% back in the second quarter of 2010, when the once mighty Nokia had 37%.     Credit: Guardian graphics    The plight of HTC is even more stark when its market position is viewed through the prism of Google&apos;s Android software. Android is the leading operating system thanks to Samsung, beating Apple&apos;s iOS system and Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone, which is used by Nokia. If consumers are flocking to Android phones, they are choosing Samsung and not HTC. Benedict Evans, technology and telecoms analyst at Enders Analysis, calls the Android smartphone market &quot;Samsung and the seven dwarves&quot; \u2013 a reference to the 1960s when IBM dominated the mainframe market, and its seven rivals fought for scraps. The modern equivalents are China&apos;s Huawei, Lenovo and ZTE, Korea&apos;s LG, Japan&apos;s Sony, the now Google-owned Motorola, and HTC. But Steve Brazier, chief executive of the research company Canalys, thinks that the HTC One phone, launched in February, offers a way back. &quot;The HTC One is hot,&quot; he said. &quot;The problem is it&apos;s not really shipping yet, which is why their first-quarter figures were bad. The product was delayed.&quot; Nonetheless, it faces a significant challenge from the Samsung Galaxy S4 phones, which also hits retailers&apos; shelves this month. Brazier adds that there is hope too for the other also-rans. For BlackBerry, he thinks it first needs to calm its US government clients, who have been eyeing the iPhone as an alternative. For Nokia, the solution is easier said than done: &quot;It needs something radically different from what&apos;s out there.&quot; HTC, BlackBerry and Nokia are fighting against a rapid decline. Since 2010, they have been squashed down from an aggregate market share of 61% to barely 10%. Now, none has more than 4% of the market. Samsung is at the top with 29%, ahead of Apple with nearly 22%. HTC&apos;s problems sum up the difficulties that competitors face when they are trying to overcome two players that dominate half the market. The One was delayed because, reports say, it couldn&apos;t get enough cameras at the required specification to satisfy its needs. Brazier said: &quot;The big issue in the smartphone business is that Samsung and Apple are cornering the supply chain, so HTC can&apos;t get &apos;tier-one&apos; components.&quot; To be tier one you have to order in large enough volumes to demand quality and timeliness along with price discounts. Once you slip from that position, it&apos;s hard to recover it. A decade ago, Apple cornered the markets in small hard drives and then solid-state storage to build its iPod, and then iPod nano, and dominate the music player market. Now it uses its growing cash pile to hire factories and production well ahead of time \u2013 locking rivals out. &quot;HTC has a real scale problem,&quot; says Evans, the Enders analyst. &quot;It&apos;s a problem that Nokia is starting to face as well. It&apos;s a problem of the reach and power that Apple and Samsung can bring to the market.&quot; Samsung, meanwhile, is completely vertically integrated, owning the factories that make everything from the memory chips to the screens, and writing its own apps and code to go on the only element of its smartphones that it doesn&apos;t make \u2013 Google&apos;s Android operating system. And even that is free. Buoyed by colossal advertising and marketing spend which dwarfs even the likes of Coca-Cola, and with worldwide distribution, it is determined to control the mobile phone market. It aims to ship 500m smartphones this year, more than the whole market in 2011. Analysts argue that Apple needs to do something radical too to catch the growth in emerging markets as the west becomes saturated. A low-cost iPhone is widely expected. That could consolidate the Apple-Samsung duopoly more firmly. Even, so Brazier thinks things can turn around. &quot;The smartphone business is very dynamic. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s played out. HTC could bounce back.&quot; Does he think that bounceback will happen by the end of the year? He paused. &quot;Well, no,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2013/apr/12/activate-london-speakers", "publicationDate": "2013-04-12T15:26:00Z", "tags": ["Activate London"], "sentences": ["@gogoDanae TH Schee, co-founder and CEO, Fertta Communications      Social entrepreneur, #OpenGov #OpenData #ICT in Taiwan, TH Schee has kicked off 3 startups, 2 NPOs in the besieged yet vibrant and democratic island, and survived a solo motorcycle ride across Australia at 15.He has pioneered several social/mobile web projects and his works directly inspired presidential and mayoral web campaigns in domestic elections since 2001."], "title": "Activate London: speakers", "article": "Sarah Akwisombe, managing director, We Are The Million     Sarah Akwisombe Photograph: Wearethemillion    Sarah joined Participle in March 2013 to develop and lead on new tech venture, We Are The Million, a micro crowdfunding site which supports small businesses to raise funds and create jobs.

Unlike most shrines, where deities are worshipped during the day, worshipping ghosts is best done after midnight, when they are more likely to respond positively. At midnight, tough guys who had rolled up in their Mercedes and BMWs, sauntered to the altar to pray on their knees. Young women in miniskirts and low-cut blouses, accompanied by bodyguards in leather jackets, placed incense in sacrificial urns and mumbled prayers, perhaps against the risks of their profession. The old prayed for the return of lovers long gone over the seas. It was 1988, and I&apos;d learned that a federal grand jury indictment had been issued against me, and the US was seeking my extradition on the grounds of my being the ringleader of the biggest cannabis smuggling organisation in the world. I&apos;d never been to Taiwan, but I headed straight there. No one had ever been extradited from there to anywhere. I&apos;d be safe. My first few days confirmed my optimism. I loved the place \u2013 there was no evidence of any law or regulation. Scooters and motorbikes carrying several passengers with no crash helmets careered through streets with no traffic signals and parked wherever they wished. Forgery was a respected profession. But I missed my kids desperately and kept thinking I should go home and wriggle out of the problem. I heard tell of a Buddhist shrine \u2013 the Temple of the 18 Kings \u2013 patronised by lawbreakers seeking advice on criminal matters. I took a taxi there to resolve my quandary, and the driver explained that during the late 1800s, a boat carrying 17 fishermen and their communal dog capsized in the Taiwan Strait. The fishermen drowned, but the dog survived. In accordance with tradition, the locals prepared a collective grave and ghost temple on a cliff overlooking the shore. The dog jumped into the grave with the bodies, refused to leave, was buried alive, and became the 18th of the kings of the temple. Eighteen is the number of hells in Chinese folk religion. The temple was shrouded in safety, mystery, and danger.     Feeling hounded \u2026 Howard Marks and his daughter Amber visit the Dog Temple    Thick clouds of eye-stinging incense swirled around the temple&apos;s red columns. Altar candles burned in honour of a dog that signified luck and good fortune as well as loyalty and friendship. Worshippers lit cigarettes instead of incense sticks, symbolising the friendship between dog-spirit and man. They stroked and rubbed images of the dog. I made an offering of cash, cigars, and a Cartier lighter, bought a charm necklace, and asked the dog should I stay or should I go. The monk in charge gave me one of 64 possible answer slips. The taxi driver translated: I had to go home. A few days later, I was in Madrid&apos;s terrorist prison trying to avoid extradition. I failed and spent the first few years of my possible 40-year incarceration vowing that should I ever get released, I would go back to Taiwan and kick that dog up its arse. Now, more than 24 years later, my daughter, Amber, was accompanying me there. During the journey, I had scoured travel guides and brochures offering bungee jumping, trekking, shopping, fishing, cookery lessons, health spas and monasteries. But I know, through my decades of travelling, that the benefits of any action vacation become distant memories once you&apos;re back at work. Even worse are anti-vacations, with lean vegetarian diets, meditation, chanting and 5am alarm calls, where drinking alcohol is discouraged. I find such holidays vexing, mind-draining, and expensive. I would settle my score with the dog, eat and drink. We checked-in to Hotel Quote in the centre of the capital, Taipei, an extremely efficiently run boutique hotel that was a finalist last year in the coveted Taipei&apos;s Best Hotel Bar after Dark award. Dawn broke after what seemed like a few minutes, and I caught a fleeting glance of Amber tip-toeing out of the room. She was off to Sun Moon Lake, about 250km away in the centre of the country, for some peace and tranquillity. I fell back asleep and missed breakfast by at least eight hours. Amber had left a note asking me not to go to the Dog Temple until she returned. As night fell, I took a taxi to the nearby Combat Zone, the only night-life area I remembered from my first visit. Almost identical to Bangkok&apos;s Patpong, the zone was a neon-lit concentration camp of more than 50 girlie bars and strip joints in a grid of small streets behind the Imperial Hotel. The zone got its start during the Vietnam war, when American soldiers partied there on their way to and from the killing fields.     Nightlife in Taipei's Yongkang Street. Photograph: Justin Guariglia/Corbis    Its boozy legacy survived, but it had aged considerably, and the tired no\u2011smoking bars and clientele lacked their previous libidinous lustre. I had a few interesting chats with some veterans who had never had any reason to go back home, while the wind picked up, howling like a flock of owls, and the pitch-black sky emptied. It was typhoon season, and one was hovering off the coast, threatening to visit. I, too, was feeling my age, and went back to the hotel to carry on sleeping off my jetlag. At breakfast the next morning, I met an American, David Frazier, who wrote for the Taipei Times. He was an endless source of information on all Taiwanese matters, knew of the Dog Temple, but had never visited it. He offered to drive us there. Daytime is never the most appropriate period to communicate with ghosts anywhere, so Amber and I were not surprised to find the Dog Temple, which I instantly recognised, almost deserted. But I was astonished to see that the temple lay next to Taiwan&apos;s first nuclear power station. David explained that the power station enclosure had been designed originally to encompass the area of the sacred tomb, but the heavy machinery broke down whenever it neared the shrine. The engineers had to abandon their original plan and the nuclear station&apos;s outer wall simply borders the tomb. This helped transform the hitherto local cult into an island-wide craze. The shrine became a focal point for successful anti-nuclear demonstrations, eventually becoming one of Taiwan&apos;s most popular temples. The cult of the dog in the 18\u00a0Kings temple is paradigmatic of the coexistence of tradition and modernity in Taiwan. The power generated by a nuclear reactor could not diminish that of a dog worshipped in a nearby temple. On the contrary, the reactor itself was incorporated into the legends\u00a0celebrating the dog-spirit, and\u00a0the modern media spread the legends throughout the island. There were simply too many visitors to cast them all as underworld types: many were simply ordinary people unconcerned about issues of morality. Bus and taxi drivers suspend temple amulets from their rear-view mirrors and place small statues of the robed dog-spirit on their dashboards. But the carnival atmosphere for which this seaside temple was so famous had inexplicably faded. It looked a bit shabby, with just two food vendors in front selling unappetising bamboo-leaf-wrapped rice and meat dumplings, braised stuffed snails, and some worryingly unrecognisable roasted animal parts. However, a pack of stray dogs loitered knowingly. Shaking with the trepidation of uncertainty, we walked slowly into the shrine. The six-foot high grey stone dog that had haunted me during my years of solitary confinement was no longer there. It had been replaced by two smaller bronze dogs, each baring their teeth savagely. I had already more or less decided not to give the big dog a hefty kick and fool around with a humbling power I did not understand, and in any event, the smaller dogs&apos; arses were inaccessible. Their ferocious mouths turned into loving smiles. I put my right hand into one of their mouths. I was here, alive, healthy, and with my wonderful daughter. I could not imagine being happier. Behind the altar, David and I climbed a hidden stairwell to a small, dark room above the temple, where we discovered a cabinet with 64 small draws, each containing a pile of small pink paper slips bearing a fortune. David, fluent in Mandarin, searched through the 64 different possible answers the dog spirit could give. One stated: &quot;Travellers will find benefit in returning home. If burdened by legal affairs, settle them peaceably.&quot; Clearly, that was the one I had received in 1988. We looked at the pink slip again. Printed in smaller type next to the larger fortune was the following: &quot;This sacred word will bring luck to one of noble heart. But for a scoundrel it will bode ill fortune. Many contradictions are apparent. The return of good fortune cannot be determined.&quot; David burst out laughing: &quot;You obviously didn&apos;t read the fine print, Howard.&quot;Later, at the end of our trip, he phoned me minutes before we boarded the plane to London: &quot;I&apos;ve found out that a second temple has just been built the other side of the nuclear power station.&quot; &quot;Don&apos;t tell me that&apos;s where the six-foot grey dog statue is,&quot; I said. &quot;No. This one is two storeys high. I don&apos;t know how we missed it.&quot;     Taipei has developed a 24-hour a day snacking culture, fed by its numerous street vendors and cafes. Photograph: Justin Guariglia/Corbis    The hotel concierge had suggested I eat at a typically Taiwanese restaurant with the unlikely name of 21\u00a0Goose &amp; Seafood, on\u00a0Jinzou Street, a road that was full of bars and restaurants heaving with rowdy clients. Every table was occupied, but a table for two had a vacant chair to which I was directed. The lone diner stood up, shook my hand, and in stuttering English introduced himself as Li. No smoking signs blazed from every wall, but everyone without exception, including the chefs, was smoking. A betel-nut vendor passed from table to table offering his wares. The set menu was the same each night, first course: goose, second course: seafood. Li and I small-talked for a while as more people crowded into the restaurant and somehow found space. He suggested we go to the bar next door for a drink. The street activity had increased even further when we went outside. Wasn&apos;t Taiwan supposed to be suffering in recession like the rest of us? Over the past few years, I had read several uninviting headlines about unemployment being at an all-time high, economic growth at an all-time low, a severely battered stock market, Sars viruses replacing visiting businessmen, and more bad news. Yet here they were spending money all night, eating jovially, exchanging phone numbers, and drinking with ebullient enthusiasm in crammed bars and restaurants filled with an atmosphere of revelry, intoxication, and fun. &quot;Taipei busier than ever,&quot; said Li, noting my looks of astonishment at the dynamic chaos. &quot;When Taipei people worry, they drink. But rest of Taiwan, bars and restaurants struggling. Sales no good. Places closing, pushing each other out of business with bargain price and happy hour. Even here in Taipei, must sell entertainment, too. Not just booze.&quot; I looked at the four Chinese women dancing on the bar, caught his drift, and nodded over to them. &quot;Like paying that lot to do their thing?&quot; &quot;No. They just office girls having good time. Bar pay for music, lights, smoke vapour, and beautiful girls for customer. Technique simple. Girls surround customer. He buys them drink. They come closer. He buys more. Chinese have special name for feeling of being surrounded by seduction, to be lost in company of beautiful women \u2013 mi huen zhen. Room next door, karaoke. Upstairs different entertainment.&quot; Upstairs housed an open-air smoking area. Several satellite dishes fed enormous plasma screens, showing a\u00a0steady stream of football games, Formula One races, and tap dances to a crowd of foreigners playing table football, pool, and darts. There was no dartboard, just punctured pictures of Karl Marx, and Fidel Castro. The male foreigners were outnumbered by Chinese of both genders looking on in noisy amazement and occasionally throwing a dart and drinking a yard of beer. Peanut shells, dog ends, and sawdust covered the floor. &quot;This new in Taipei,&quot; said Li. &quot;Taiwanese like new.&quot; Another evening, pulling up alongside a heavily populated pavement, we were greeted by immaculately dressed waiters bringing us menu cards to fill in. They would find us when our table was ready. Din Tai Fung is the most famous restaurant in Taipei. There are dozens of cooks looking like surgeons, heaps of bamboo steamers, and great piles of pork and dough rolled and wrapped into its signature dish \u2013 the dumpling \u2013 thin and fresh, never soggy or doughy, and served immediately after it is steamed.     Food for thought \u2026 tucking into dishes at Modern Toilet    The most popular is also the most basic, made with green onion, ginger, pork, soy sauce and sesame oil. The floors and furniture were cleaner than any I have ever experienced, including those of top-end private hospitals and clinics. After taking our seats, we were politely but thoroughly instructed which dumpling went with which sauce and the order in which to eat them. The bright lights helped ensure a quick turnover. One comes here to eat, not for romance. Taipei has an advanced 24-hour snacking culture enabled by street vendors, who will show up wherever people gather, whether at temples or cinemas. Simplicity and freshness are the hallmarks of Taiwanese street food. It&apos;s fresh because the turnover is high, and simple because each stand concentrates on a single dish.Most of the stalls are basic set-ups with a few stools, a generator, a tank of cooking gas, and a grill, pot, or steamer. Although grilled sausages and squid, with their smoke and flame, are the most visible street food, a Taipei night market will also have stands selling fried rice, congee, grilled beef, oyster omelettes, wheat gluten, onion pancake, barbecued pork, roast chestnuts, fresh juice, and dumplings. Some of the street food comes from\u00a0extreme ends of the food chain and looks more like a biology field trip than dinner: entrails, innards, wings, knuckles, feet, tongues and congealed blood are common. Wafting down every alley and byway in Taipei is the\u00a0unmistakable and often appalling odour of stinky tofu, best eaten when smothered in soy, vinegar, garlic and chilli sauce. Most Taipei restaurants, however, no matter how good, are featureless, except for those that concentrate on one feature: Tai\u00a0G, in the Shipai night market, serves just medicinal chicken soup, tailored to the customer&apos;s particular ailment. Jail (37 Dunhua South Road) is decorated like a prison and the waiters dress like inmates. Visitors can put on manacles and have their photo taken in a cell. I gave both of those a miss, but did try Snake Alley \u2013 which is a narrow covered passageway where writhing snakes are skinned alive so that people\u00a0can drink their warm blood while scoffing snake stew \u2013 and Modern Toilet (Lane 50, Xining S Road), which has seats and serving dishes shaped like toilets. The food in each was disgusting. I found the Taiwanese very friendly and relaxed. One can occasionally think Taipei has been far too busy making things to offer anything at all to visitors. But what it does have is genuine, and everything you do see is for the daily lives of the Taiwanese. There is nothing fake for tourists, mainly because there are so few of them. \u2022 The trip was provided by Cox &amp; Kings (0845 154 8941, coxandkings.co.uk).

Few knew much about Taiwan, or had heard of either its former name, Formosa (&quot;beautiful&quot; in Portuguese), or its official post-war name, the Republic of China (RoC). Their vision was a far cry from my surroundings at Sun Moon Lake, an hour south of Taipei by rail. The train, complete with karaoke carriage, had travelled through dense forests and past towns that seemed to be made largely from shipping containers. But at the lakeside, the stillness was gobsmacking. I sat on the terrace of the lovely Lalu Hotel and sipped tea from a porcelain cup that was topped up endlessly. The scent of lemongrass filled the air, and the reflections of huge mountains shape-shifted in the still water. Just visible on a hill was the golden roof of a temple that houses the remains of Xuanzang, a seventh-century monk whose travels round India inspired the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West.     Lalu Hotel infinity pool    High above it stands the Tsen pagoda, built on the orders of Chiang-Kai-shek, the nationalist politician who became China&apos;s nominal leader in 1926. After losing the civil war to the communists, he set up what he and the US thought would be a temporary haven in Taiwan in 1949. He called his state the Republic of China, and it held a UN seat in that name until 1971. Now Taiwan can&apos;t change its official name from RoC without provoking China, 75 miles away, which claims to own it. But it has nevertheless established the first democratic state in the Chinese-speaking world and is regarded as one of Asia&apos;s freest countries. &quot;This,&quot; laughed an i-Pad-wielding monk sitting beside me on the terrace, &quot;is where Chiang dreamed of one day retaking mainland China.&quot; Surprised to see a monk in a five-star hotel, I asked him what he was doing. &quot;I find the view meditative,&quot; he said. He had a point. This place is so serene they don&apos;t even bother playing relaxing sounds in the spa. The gentle breeze carries the scent of osmanthus flowers. A huge open water swimming race is held here every September, but I had just missed it. I consoled myself with a few laps of the infinity pool, a water yoga session with teacher Rajesh Mishra, and having my third eye opened with an Ayurvedic massage. The next day I joined Japanese and Chinese tourists on a boat trip around tiny Lalu island, sacred to the Thao tribe, the smallest ethnic group in Taiwan. Tribal peoples arrived in Taiwan from all over the world for thousands of years, although the origin of many of these aboriginal groups remains a mystery.

He&apos;ll be the American equivalent of Jamie&apos;s history teacher David Starkey. Only, you&apos;d suspect, more radical. Stone&apos;s TV history class might well be named US Heresies 101. &quot;We&apos;re going to take these texts from regular history and compare them to what we think happened.&quot; He will teach that the bombing of Hiroshima was premised on a lie, that the CIA&apos;s secret war against leftist Central American governments was based on chimerical communist threat, that the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq were follies and, perhaps most intolerable of all to patriots, that the United States of America is just as self-serving, duplicitous, corrupt, oppressive, expansionist and racist as \u2013 there&apos;s no easy way to say this \u2013 the British empire. In the 1960s, Stone was awarded a bronze star and a purple heart with oak leaf cluster for heroism in Vietnam. If he survives lynching by adolescent reality-show neo-cons, he should get another medal. It will be the latest improbable chapter in the life story of a man raised as an Eisenhower Republican, who fought as a patriot in Vietnam and made his name in Hollywood writing such splashy, amoral screenplays as Scarface for Al Pacino, before becoming an Oscar-winning, Ch\u00e1vez-admiring Buddhist whom the Observer described as &quot;one of the few committed men of\u00a0the left working in mainstream American cinema&quot;. Today he tells me he is looking forward to attending the Subversive film festival in Croatia. Of\u00a0course he is. One reason Stone has mutated into concerned TV historian is because in 2011 the US federal government survey reported that only 12% of US high school students knew their country&apos;s history. Why is that? &quot;My theory is history is boring because the horror stories are left out. What&apos;s left in is the sanitised Disney version \u2013 a triumphalist narrative. We kind of always win. And we&apos;re always right.&quot; For the past five years, the 66-year-old director has been working with historian Peter Kuznick on the desanitised version, complete with horror stories. The result is a 10-hour TV series called The Untold History of the United States, and an allied 750-page book. Stone and Kuznick want to confound the idea that the US fulfilled the destiny expressed in 1630 by John Winthrop, English Puritan lawyer and one of New England&apos;s founders, namely that America&apos;s destiny was to become a divinely ordained &quot;city on the hill&quot; \u2013 a beacon for the rest of the world to follow. &quot;I was brought up with all that manifest destiny stuff when I was a kid,&quot; says Stone. &quot;I was sleepwalking until I was 40.&quot; What catalysed him to make this documentary history was finding that the sanitised version of US\u00a0history he had jettisoned was still being taught to his children. &quot;The reasons given for the atomic bomb are, in my opinion, nefarious and disingenuous. But we bought it. Now my 17-year-old daughter goes to a school \u2013 a very good school \u2013 where they&apos;re still told that in the textbooks: &apos;Japan would not have surrendered. The bomb ended the war to save American lives.&apos;&quot; Didn&apos;t President Harry S Truman argue that the bombing of Hiroshima spared the lives of thousands of GIs who would have otherwise died in an invasion of Japan in 1945? &quot;That&apos;s bullshit,&quot; snaps Stone. &quot;And there&apos;s a very practical reason it&apos;s bullshit \u2013 we couldn&apos;t have even mounted an invasion until November.&quot; His and Kuznick&apos;s theory, then, is that the atomic bombing of civilians was aimed, not at securing Japanese surrender, but at shocking and awing Stalin. They believe that, had Hiroshima and Nagasaki not been bombed in August 1945 by the US, something more intolerable to both Japanese and American sensibilities would have happened \u2013 namely that the Red Army, which by August had already swept through Japanese-occupied Manchuria, would have invaded Japan. Stone imagines the scenario from a Japanese perspective: &quot;The Japanese are terrified. These guys [ie Soviet troops] are beasts. They rape, they kill. They&apos;d kill an emperor without thinking about it. Look what they did in Germany.&quot; As for Truman&apos;s US, the threat of a rampant Soviet Union in the postwar Pacific rim was even more chilling. So nuking Japan was aimed at impressing the Soviets. The bombs, for Stone and Kuznick, didn&apos;t just kill thousands of innocents, but unleashed a nuclear arms race and the cold war.     The real reason for America dropping the atomic bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima (above) was to impress Stalin, claims Stone. Photograph: EPA    For Stone, the US has, ever since those two fateful days in August 1945, been in the malefic grip of the military and hegemonic delusions. It has postured as extending democratic ideals but rather has extended control across the globe by any means necessary, including covert CIA support for death\u00a0squads, drone attacks and calamitous invasions. &quot;We were showing we&apos;re as barbaric as we can be. As ruthless as the Russians could be in Germany, we could be more ruthless. We had no problems dropping the atomic bomb on civilians \u2013 a devastating war crime. If the Germans had dropped that bomb and lost the war, that bomb would have been stigmatised for all time. There would have been some international agreement to control it.&quot; But, Stone and Kuznick argue, because the US used atomic bombs first and was dishonest about why it did so, that international agreement didn&apos;t happen: instead, Stone grew up under that threat of nuclear Armageddon. This account, unsurprisingly, has enraged some US historians. Writing in\u00a0the New York Review of Books, Sean Wilentz argued that Stone and Kuznick ignore scholarship that contradicts their assumptions. &quot;It is hardly clear, for example, that the Japanese government was close to surrendering on the Allies&apos; terms in the summer of 1945,&quot; writes Wilentz. &quot;American analysts believed that, short of a bloody invasion of its shores, Japanese leaders would fight hard, holding out for a much milder negotiated settlement, which negates Stone and Kuznick&apos;s contention that Truman was misleading about his motive for using atomic bombs.&quot; Arguably, though, Stone and Kuznick&apos;s contention is less readily confuted. In his recent biography of so-called father of the bomb, Robert Oppenheimer, for instance, Ray Monk http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/nov/09/ray-monk-life-in-writing reports that the only nuclear scientist to have resigned on principle from the Manhattan Project, Joseph Rotblat http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2005/sep/02/obituaries.obituaries, did so when he realised that the atomic bomb was not to be used to defeat the Nazis but to cow their ostensible allies. Rotblat overheard the military director of the Manhattan Project, Lieutenant General Richard Groves, say at a wartime dinner party: &quot;You realise of course that the main purpose of this project is to subdue the Russkies.&quot; In any event, Stone and Kuznick&apos;s more intriguing task is to do counterfactual history. Their American history isn&apos;t untold, but rather a meditation on what could have \u2013 and, in their view, should \u2013 have, happened. What if, they wonder, Truman had not succeeded Franklin D Roosevelt as president in April 1945? What if, instead of choosing Truman \u2013 whom the pair psychopathologise as having unresolved &quot;gender issues&quot; and portray as weak, biddable and blustering (&quot;To err is Truman,&quot; 1940s Republicans sneered) \u2013 as Roosevelt&apos;s vice-presidential candidate in the 1944 presidential election, the Democratic convention had once more chosen the now little-known Henry Wallace to be FDR&apos;s running mate? Their contention is that if, after FDR\u00a0died in April 1945, vice-president Wallace had succeeded, postwar world history would have been very different. &quot;The bomb would not have been dropped with Wallace or Roosevelt as president, in my opinion,&quot; says Stone. &quot;Not at all. Not a chance. They [the military] would have opposed Wallace, given him a hard time, but you can&apos;t force a president to drop a bomb. You just can&apos;t.&quot; Given that Stone and Kuznick&apos;s revisionist American history starts from the idea that Truman lowered the US&apos;s moral threshold and many of his successors continued that descent, this\u00a0is no small issue. The drama of that\u00a01944 Democratic convention is one that Stone and Kuznick wrote as a Hitchcockian thriller in the late 1990s before deciding to make it, a decade later, the linchpin of their documentary. &quot;Bush wasn&apos;t an aberration,&quot; says Stone of the two-term Republican president whom he savaged in his 2008 biopic W, &quot;Bush is the climax to an American mindset that had started with Truman and accelerated after world war two.&quot;     Stone won military awards for his time as a soldier in Vietnam. He thinks Kennedy would not have committed US troops in south-east Asia. Photograph: Alfred Batungbacal/Time Life Pictures/Getty Images    He portrays Wallace as the man who could have spared the US its postwar debacles \u2013 the cold war, Vietnam, the &quot;war on terror&quot; \u2013 had he managed to get that vice-presidential nomination in 1944. Wallace was, in short, the good father snatched away when America needed him most. It&apos;s hard not to think that Stone has told this story before. In his 1991 film JFK, he depicted President Kennedy as\u00a0a peace-loving liberal taken from America by a murderous conservative conspiracy covered up by the Warren Commission. He and Kuznick write: &quot;We do know that Kennedy had many enemies who deplored progressive change just as fervently as those who had blocked Henry Wallace in 1944 when he was trying to lead the United States and the world down a similar path to peace and prosperity.&quot; For them, Kennedy died resisting the forces that wanted to push him into war with the Soviet Union. If you wanted to psychoanalyse Stone as he and Kuznick do Truman, you might well focus on his close relationship with his father and the traumatising impact of his parents&apos; abrupt divorce when their only child was away at school in 1962. His father Louis, a stockbroker and non-practising Jew, had been married to Jacqueline, a\u00a0Frenchwoman and non-practising Catholic. They divorced in the year that Kennedy faced down the Soviet threat over the Cuban missile crisis. The following year, JFK was killed in Dealey Plaza, becoming the lost father to a grieving nation. For Stone, Kennedy was the guy who could have spared the US the debacle of Vietnam and ended the cold war. &quot;It was just inconceivable that Kennedy would have said yes to ground troops in Vietnam. He&apos;d said no to the military on Laos. He&apos;d said no at the Bay of Pigs on air support. And no at the Cuban missile crisis \u2013 that&apos;s the greatest single act of human courage this world has ever witnessed with that\u00a0much at stake.&quot;     John F Kennedy campaigning in 1960: 'Saying no at the Cuban missile crisis was the single greatest act of human courage this world has witnessed.' Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis    You could fit most of Stone&apos;s cinema into this Oedipal frame. His 1986 Vietnam movie Platoon explored his Vietnam war experiences, with Charlie Sheen&apos;s rookie grunt confronting two war-seasoned father figures, the good sergeant (Willem Dafoe) and the bad sergeant (Tom Berenger). In Wall Street, Charlie Sheen&apos;s ingenue trader is mentored by Michael Douglas&apos;s venal Gordon Gekko. Stone&apos;s 1995 Nixon biopic, starring Anthony Hopkins, could be taken as manichean flipside to JFK \u2013 the bad father undone at Watergate as the good father was slain in Dallas. The Untold History of the US is, perhaps, also worth an Oedipal reading \u2013 it&apos;s the latest rebellion against the conservative politics his dad installed in him. &quot;I was born a conservative,&quot; he says. &quot;My father raised me Eisenhower Republican. I was very much fearful of the communist conspiracy to take over the world.&quot; That fear led him to fight in\u00a0Vietnam. &quot;I was a patriot. I really believed it.&quot; Didn&apos;t Vietnam radicalise you? &quot;No. I came out of Vietnam bloodied but not really understanding the geopolitical realities. &quot;I wrote the screenplay for Born on\u00a0the Fourth of July [his adaptation of\u00a0the autobiography of disillusioned Vietnam vet Ron Kovic, which Stone eventually filmed in 1989 starring Tom Cruise] in 1976. Ron was shot, castrated, in a wheelchair. He was radicalised by Vietnam, but I wasn&apos;t.&quot; It was witnessing what the US did covertly in Central America during the 80s that did the job. &quot;The scales dropped from my eyes when I saw the American presence throughout Guatemala. We trained and funded the death squads of\u00a0Guatemala, the elite troops who did a lot of the massacring. I saw what we did in El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua too. The ultimate goal was to\u00a0stop the communists taking control of the region \u2013 breaching the Rio Grande, as Reagan said. &quot;I thought at the time, looking around: &apos;This is Vietnam redux.&apos; I may be stupid, but it took me about 15 years to get it. I saw that America was this bully and I hated it. From then on, I\u00a0made progressive films.&quot; The first of those was Salvador (1986) about a cynical hack (James Woods) politically awakened by witnessing the military coup in El Salvador propelled by US-backed death squads. His subsequent career, right up to The Untold History of the United States, amounts to a retrospective critique of\u00a0what he believed about the US until he was 40.

She was against the Contras. She voted for the Iraq war. She urged Obama to send in more troops to\u00a0Afghanistan. She&apos;s always taken the &apos;America is indispensable&apos; routine and, most recently, she wrote an article for Foreign Affairs. She spoke of the 21st century as America&apos;s Pacific century, arguing that China can and should be contained. She&apos;s like those idiots on Fox News who make an enemy of China by presenting them as a threat. Who&apos;s the threat? We have 800 to 1,000 foreign bases; they have one.&quot; Not that Stone lets the current US president off the hook. &quot;Meanwhile, we have Obama spending $12bn over two years selling arms to Taiwan. We&apos;re\u00a0putting arms into Vietnam and Australia. Ach,&quot; he says exasperatedly, &quot;here we go again.&quot; Stone is certainly more compelling as Cassandra than Pollyanna. He suggests the Pentagon is obsessed with &quot;full-spectrum dominance&quot;. &quot;It means we control air, land, sea, space and cyberspace. That&apos;s the plan. We&apos;ve already attacked Iran with Israel with cybertools. Now we&apos;re truly seeking control of space. They&apos;re talking about drones 250 miles in space that can fire off laser blasts.&quot; For Stone, these are delusions akin to Reagan&apos;s thwarted Star Wars dreams of the 1980s. He and Kuznick approvingly quote ex-Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev: &quot;Everyone is used to America as the shepherd that tells everyone what to do. But this period has already ended.&quot; Not so much city on the hill, as city over the hill. Nobody seems to have told the US, yet. Stone is upbeat: &quot;In 15, 20 years, some young person is going to see The Untold History of the United States and it will maybe inspire the person who&apos;s going to lead the next generation.

The changing web platform landscape: more fragmentation? &gt;&gt; Adobe Digital Media Blog  In this new web platform landscape, what about Adobe&apos;s contributions to open source browsers? What impact does additional browser fragmentation has on Adobe&apos;s efforts? Adobe contributes to standards in open browser implementations for many reasons. One of them is that our new generation Edge tools use a &apos;web design surface&apos;. For well over a year now, we have chosen to use the Chromium Embeded Framework (CEF) to provide this &apos;web design surface&apos;. So naturally, we will contribute to Blink since it is now the core engine that powers CEF. Another reason for contributing to open browsers is to accelerate the availability of new features on the web. This is why we collaborate with Mozilla on a number of standards and contribute code to Gecko (like this patch on masking for canvas). And this is why we will also contribute to WebKit, in addition to Blink, now that the two are separate projects.

Taiwan probes Samsung &apos;dirty tricks&apos; vs HTC&apos; &gt;&gt; AFP  Taiwanese authorities said Monday they had launched an investigation into allegations that South Korean tech giant Samsung hired students to post malicious comments about local rival HTC online. &quot;The case was set up last week after we received complaints,&quot; Fair Trade Commission spokesman Sun Lih-chyun told AFP. He said the probe would look into allegations that Samsung engaged in false advertising and that if the allegations were upheld, Samsung and its local advertising agent could face a fine of up to Tw$25 million ($835,000). Complaints emerged this month, with internet users alleging that Samsung, through its local agent, had hired students to write online articles attacking HTC and recommending Samsung cellphones, the United Evening News said\u2026 in a statement on its Facebook page, www.facebook.com/SamsungTaiwan, Samsung Taiwan said it regretted &quot;any inconvenience and confusion from the Internet event&quot;. &quot;Samsung Taiwan has halted all internet marketing such as posting articles on websites,&quot; it said.

Now, Apple pessimism is even stronger. No matter what they release and no matter how well it sells, they won&apos;t win over the press, the pundits, the stock market, or the rhetoric. Not this year.

You built what?!: A tractor for the apocalypse &gt;&gt; Popular Science  Seeking a fresh start, [Marcin] Jakubowski bought 30 acres of Missouri farmland and a tractor. Life in relative seclusion proved uneventful until, one day in 2008, his tractor broke down for the second and last time, spurring him to start an open-source industrial revolution. To Jakubowski, the tractor seemed designed to fail. Why should he sink more money into fixing it or buy a replacement? He wanted a simple and useful machine, and one he could repair and upgrade on the fly. &quot;It boiled down to lower cost in the long run,&quot; he says. Jakubowski built the first LifeTrac, as he calls his DIY tractor, in three months for $6,000\u2014about $30,000 less than a comparable mass-produced model. Seeing room for improvement, he built a second prototype in just six days. He posted his progress on the tractor and other machines to an online wiki, which attracted followers, who suggested their own design tweaks.

To succeed with an Android fork, a company has to drive development in the same way that Apple did when it spawned WebKit from KHTML, just as Google is doing as it forks Blink from WebKit.

Animoca: Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Tab 2 line and the Kindle Fire family are still the most popular Android tablets worldwide &gt;&gt; Android Police  According to the firm \u2014 which distributes games and entertainment apps \u2014 the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is the top Android tablet with 11.8% of its network, followed closely by the 10.1 model of the same line. Following that is the Kindle Fire and the Kindle Fire HD which collectively make up another 12.4% of Animoca&apos;s users. All told, before we get to the fan-favorite Nexus 7, a whopping 37.3% of the market has already gone to Samsung and Amazon (the former of which has plenty more share with other, less popular devices). So, what&apos;s the deal? Those of us who live in the Nexus bubble would assume the Nexus 7 [with 3.8% of the Android market] would be the most popular, right? Well, funny story. As of right now, Google&apos;s seven inch slate is available in just ten countries.

But it&apos;s not the sole player around. At the end of March Thai audiences flocked to see horror comedy Pee Mak Phrakanong \u2013 based on the Mae Nak folktale about a man who returns from war and unwittingly settles back in with the ghost of his wife, who has died in childbirth. It had the second biggest opening (21.2m baht/\u00a3478,000) ever for a Thai film, and with over 300m baht to date, it is closing on the all-time box-office record (550m baht) held by 2001&apos;s war epic The Legend of Suriyothai. Thai audiences seem to love their history: their domestic all-time top 10 is dominated by it, including Suriyothai, the King Naresuan series \u2013 about to get its fifth instalment \u2013 and the 1999 version of the Mae Nak legend (set in the late 18th/early 19th centuries). But it&apos;s an irreverent take on tradition that has pulled people in for this one. Pee Mak Phrakanong, directed by Banjong Pisanthanakun (also responsible for 2004 global horror hit Shutter), has been transformed from a lovelorn, nostalgic fable to a slick comedy that affectionately teases source material deeply embedded in the Thai collective consciousness. There have been about 30 film adaptations of the story \u2013 including animation, porn and, last year, a 3D version. As well as making the most of photogenic soap stars Mario Maurer and Davika Horne, Pisanthanakun&apos;s version adds copious pop-culture references \u2013 to the likes of The Last Samurai and David Blaine \u2013 and 21st-century snark, making fun of ineffectual monks. It&apos;s that injection of attitude that sets Pee Mak Phrakanong on a nimble contemporary tangent to the country&apos;s history-obsessed box office: it&apos;s easily outpaced second world war love story Khu Kam, another national favourite that has seen multiple adaptations, which was released at the same time. &quot;The reason Pee Mak makes crazy money is because it&apos;s loose and funny,&quot; writes the Bangkok Post&apos;s Kong Rithdee, &quot;and perhaps because it triggers this cool, shallow belief in the star-crossed lovers overcoming the odds set by ideology and death.&quot; The film also seems to be a leap in quality for an industry that has struggled commercially over the last few years and only has a global presence thanks to its arthouse branch, led by Apitchatpong Weerasethakul and Pen-Ek Ratanaruang. &quot;The real good news is that Pee Mak is actually pretty good,&quot; writes Wise Kwai, for Thai newspaper the Nation, &quot;Distinguishing itself from most other Thai horror comedies, this one follows an actual script, which is smartly co-written by the director.&quot; Thailand could make horror comedy \u2013 compared to the more baleful Japanese spookers, or the bloodier Korean variants \u2013 its speciality: Kao Krian, about ghosts scuppering a property developer, and Countdown, by Pee Mak&apos;s youth-focused studio GTH, are just two of the recent films. And it&apos;s a good time to export horror comedy, with a steady flow of it \u2013 especially from the zombie contingent \u2013 having carved out a significant market for it in the last decade. Pee Mak could be too geared to Thai palates to travel all the way around the globe, but judging by a tight south-east Asian release schedule (Indonesia, 5 April; Hong Kong, 16 May; Cambodia, 23 May; Malaysia, 6 June; Singapore, 13 June; Taiwan, 6 August), it fancies its chance in the neighbourhood. So it should: it draws on the vein of wronged-woman folklore that recurs throughout Asia (Ringu drew similarly on Japan&apos;s Yotsuya Kaidan story), and there seems to be a strong appetite for horror in that part of the world. Indonesia is a prolific producer of films with the same fetid perfume of tropical morbidity that underlines the Pee Mak legend; Malaysia has been banging horror films out since a three-decade ban on the genre, for being contrary to Islam, was lifted in 2003. If Pee Mak can secure a release in the massive Chinese market, and stake a claim for the Thai industry, that would be fine news for film diversity in the eastern hemisphere. \u2022 Next week&apos;s After Hollywood will ask whether it&apos;s crunch-time at the Chinese box office for Hollywood.

The support is limited, the pay is bad, the hours are insufficient, and the opportunities for career advancement are minimal. Cooperative Home Care Associates (CHCA), a home care agency in the Bronx, bucks that trend. The retention rate for its worker base of 2,300 Latina and African-American women runs at more than 80%; the average for New York staggers along at between 40% and 60%. The co-operative&apos;s success dates back to its origins. Its founding charter mentions nothing about shareholder returns or profit maximisation. Instead, it focuses on strengthening opportunities for unemployed individuals (primarily women), and improving the quality of care for low-income elders and people with disabilities. Oh, and agency staff have an opportunity for an ownership stake, too. Nearly three decades later and that formula has made CHCA into the largest worker-owned co-operative in the US. &quot;Our work runs counter to an industry paradigm that regards direct-care staff as temporary and easily replaceable [whereas] we guarantee quality jobs that recognise the dignity of their work and its value to the community,&quot; says spokesperson Ben Freeman, noting that the co-operative not only offers training to low-income women but promises a permanent job at the end of it. Best for the world CHCA&apos;s people-centric business model has earned it a new moniker, as a &quot;Best for the World&quot; company. The US home care agency is one of 67 firms that find their way on to a list of private-sector change-makers. Other notable examples include an Afghan telecoms company, a US community development bank and experiential travel company from Tanzania. Released today, the B Corp Best for the World List is the creation of B Lab, a US non-profit whose stated goal is to serve &quot;a global movement of entrepreneurs using the power of business to solve social and environmental problems&quot;. The result is a network of so-called B Corp companies. Launched seven years ago, the B Corporation movement of companies wishing to benefit society as well as their shareholders now counts 728 certified firms in 26 countries across 60 industries. Each is obliged to submit an impact assessment, with the top 10% making it on to the Best for the World List. &quot;This feels to us to be the most important list in the world because business is the most powerful man-made force on the planet, and we ought to be recognising those companies that are using business as the greatest force for good&quot;, says Jay Coen Gilbert, co-founder of B Lab. Coen Gilbert doesn&apos;t do understatement. To his mind, businesses in the 21st century will have to readjust to a &quot;different definition of success&quot;, one based on social and environmental factors, as well as financial. B Corp entrepreneurs believe that, too. According to Coen Gilbert, the prize for those setting the pace will be the ability to attract the best talent, the &quot;most evangelical customers&quot; and the most patient capital: &quot;So you [companies] are going to want to compete to be the best in the world at being the best for the world.&quot; B Corps: a growing movement This year&apos;s list differs in a few subtle, but significant ways from the inaugural list in 2012. First is the number of companies under consideration. The B Corp movement is growing fast, with 200 or so more certified companies now than this time last year. A second factor is the size of the certified firms. Micro-enterprises of less than ten employees still comprise a sizeable proportion of B Lab&apos;s top 10%, but some bigger names are creeping in, too. Greyston Bakery, for example, the long-standing brownie supplier to Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s ice-cream, makes the list. So, too, does Give Something Back Office Supplies, California&apos;s largest independent office supply company. The last 12 months have seen large national brands like New Belgian Brewing, in Colorado, US dairy co-operative Cabot Creamery, and Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s itself become B Corp members as well \u2013 a status already claimed by global clothing retailer Patagonia. The list reveals a shift in the movement&apos;s geographical scope as well. Until recently, North American firms dominated. Last year that began to change, with B Lab launching a South American hub called Sistema B. Now, a small bevy of B Corp-certified companies are beginning to crop up in corners of western Europe, south-east Asia and east Africa too. This year&apos;s Best For the World list, for example, includes entrants from Kenya, Colombia, Nicaragua, South Korea and Turkey, among other emerging markets. &quot;The most exciting thing that&apos;s happening in the B Corp community is that it&apos;s becoming a global movement ... This next generation of entrepreneurial activity is going to change the rules of the game, by measuring not only their financial success but also by measuring their social and environmental impact,&quot; Coen Gilbert enthuses. Arguably the most important difference is unfolding away from the cut and thrust of business altogether. Company law, no less, is shifting. There&apos;s always been a legal element to the B Corp movement. To obtain certification, companies must give legal protection to directors to consider the interests of all stakeholders, not just shareholders. That gives long-term assurance of the mission of the firm, says Jentri Provenzano, spokesperson for WS Badger, a US manufacturer of organic body care products and member of B Lab&apos;s elite club: &quot;So even if Donald Trump were to sweep in next week and make us an offer we couldn&apos;t refuse \u2026 he&apos;d have to follow the things that we&apos;ve set up.&quot; Companies can write the rules for their own businesses, but it ultimately falls to politicians to draw up norms for the business community at large. And the evidence suggests that lawmakers are at last beginning to act. In the US, around a dozen states have now passed laws recognising benefit corporations \u2013 legal entities much like B Corps, but without the obligatory certification. Similar laws are up for debate in 20 or so other states. Significantly, that number includes Delaware, the symbolic home of US corporate law and historically the chief cheerleader for profit maximisation. Further afield, benefit corp laws are under consideration in Chile, Taiwan and South Korea. Clearly the B Corp movement is gaining momentum and growing in influence, but are its members really about to usher in an era of sustainable, stakeholder-friendly capitalism? Just maybe, says Charmian Love, chief executive of sustainability consultancy Volans (also a B Corp firm). &quot;If the companies that are becoming B Corp-certified continue to grow and scale, proving that the B Corp model works \u2026 then I think it will become more mainstream, and I think that will pressure some of the big corporations to think and challenge what their business models currently look like.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Microsoft multiyear license growth softens pain of PC decline &gt;&gt; Reuters  &quot;Microsoft has successfully transitioned into an enterprise software company and these results show that, because the strength of server and tools and the actual way they sell licenses to business is making up for the missing PC sales,&quot; said Kim Caughey Forrest, an analyst at Fort Pitt Capital. Effectively, Microsoft no longer relies on a new PC to make money from software. Only 20 percent of the company&apos;s product revenue comes from computer makers paying license fees to put Windows on their machines. About 45% comes from multiyear licensing agreements with customers - generally big companies paying millions of dollars for three-year access to Microsoft&apos;s Windows and Office software. The strength of that model is reflected in Microsoft&apos;s total unearned revenue balance - a measure of the strength of its long-term business - which rose 13% from a year earlier and now stands at $17.1 billion.  jQuery 2.0 released &gt;&gt; Official jQuery blog  You asked for it, you got it: jQuery 2.0 has arrived!

It would be deadly were it not for the extraordinary dexterity of the bus and lorry drivers who negotiate its bends, working some sort of permanent miracle. The view is breathtaking, if you dare take your eyes off the road. But in Khadichaur no one complains about the highway traffic thundering past. A few years ago this small town, on the banks of the Sun Koshi river, became known as Chinatown. Here you can find all the goods its powerful neighbour manufactures so cheaply: phones, clothes, shoes, televisions, soft toys and such. Bhairav Chhetri runs a shop selling blankets, all &quot;Made in China&quot;. &quot;Business is OK but the competition is increasingly stiff,&quot; he says. &quot;Five years ago there were only about 20 shops here. Now there are nearly 100.&quot; Other shopping towns are appearing along the highway. Chhetri makes regular trips across the border to stock up. He travels the 35km as far as Kodari, on the border, by coach or lorry, then walks several kilometres through no man&apos;s land, and crosses the narrow Friendship bridge to enter Zhangmu in Tibet. He buys from wholesalers, all of them Han Chinese. &quot;All the dealing is done in Nepalese,&quot; the shopkeeper explains. &quot;They&apos;ve learned the language. They&apos;re smart.&quot; He hires Nepalese porters to carry his goods back to Kodari, where he pays about 15% of the purchase value in duty. Chhetri has never been any further along Highway 318, which leads to Lhassa and ultimately to Shanghai, more than 5,000km further east. This road has become the main route for the spread of Chinese influence into Tibet and beyond. Chinese goods are on sale in Kathmandu and other places in Nepal. But not all the lorries are destined for Nepal: some carry their wares on into India. The Araniko highway, regularly blocked by monsoon landslides, has thus become an improbable vector for globalisation, bearing almost $200m worth of goods a year. The highway is also testimony to Beijing&apos;s methodical conquest of new territory. The road was built in the 1960s, thanks to Chinese funds, replacing a track barely wide enough for two yaks to pass. Now China is planning to widen the road. At the end of 2012 the former Chinese ambassador in Nepal, Yang Houlan, officially opened a huge container depot outside Kodari. A larger bridge will be built alongside the existing one, to allow lorries to cross. Kodari is still the only legal point of entry between China and Nepal, two countries with a common border stretching for 1,400km. But other routes will be cut through the Himalayas. A 17km stretch of mule track between Gyirong in Tibet and Syapru Besi, across the border, is being turned into a proper road, at a cost of $20m. China also plans to extend the railway line from Lhassa to Shigatse, Tibet&apos;s second-largest city, as far as Kathmandu, and to build a new airport at Pokhara, Nepal, opening the way for visitors and goods. China is investing billions in Nepal, one of the world&apos;s poorest countries and traditionally part of India&apos;s sphere of influence. It is building infrastructure for transport, telecommunications and hydroelectric power. Yang set out Beijing&apos;s intentions in an interview published by the Nepalese daily Republica last December, explaining that in economic terms Nepal was a corridor connecting China to south Asia. Or in other words a way into India and its huge market. The two giants are on chilly terms and their long common border, a subject of constant dispute, is closed and militarised. Yet the volume of trade is soaring, reaching $60bn in 2010, with the balance largely in China&apos;s favour. Beijing has invested in the port at Kolkata, and now it is buying overland access through the Himalayas. &quot;Nepal will be a friendship bridge between China and India,&quot; said the Maoist prime minister of Nepal, Baburam Bhattarai, who was ousted in March. Delhi is afraid it will be more of a Trojan horse, concerned at the prospect of a massive influx of Chinese goods, served by the free-trade agreement linking the two countries. In exchange for its largesse, Beijing has demanded that Nepal recognise the annexation of Tibet and repression of political opposition there. The joint statement issued during a brief visit to Kathmandu in January 2012 by the then prime minister Wen Jiabao, the first in 10 years, was perfectly clear on this point: &quot;Both Taiwan and Tibet are integral parts of the Chinese territory. The Nepalese side firmly supports the efforts made by the Chinese side to uphold state sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity, and does not allow any forces to use Nepalese territory for any anti-China or separatist activities.&quot; Restrictions have since been placed on campaigning by the 20,000 Tibetans exiled in Nepal. On 10 March a demonstration to mark the anniversary of the 1959 uprising was banned. Any &quot;anti-Chinese activity&quot; is punished, despite the lack of any firm legal basis. Unfortunately Tibetan monks burning themselves to death will make little difference to the balance of power. \u2022 This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/26/ang-lee-family-values-life-pi", "publicationDate": "2013-04-26T11:59:01Z", "tags": ["Family", "Life and style", "Ang Lee", "Film"], "sentences": ["He\u00a0and my mother moved to Taiwan following the Chinese civil war.", "I left Taiwan to come to America to study drama and then returned home to make the biggest movie I&apos;ve made.", "It was very emotional for me filming Life of Pi in Taiwan.", "Taiwan is like my floating island."], "title": "Ang Lee: My family values", "article": "My late father, Sheng Lee, was a traditional Chinese authority figure. He\u00a0and my mother moved to Taiwan following the Chinese civil war. My father represented the traditional Chinese patriarchal society. I was always living in his shadow; that was my big thing. I was shy and docile and never rebellious. But he taught me how to survive and how to be useful. He was a stately man who was very pragmatic, the headmaster of a high school \u2013 I don&apos;t know if that was a good\u00a0or a bad thing. When I was growing up [as one of four children] he made me study all the time; studying was all that was important to him. He was not much fun and he was kind of disillusioned in me in some ways. Artistically, I was very repressed. I never really got to express myself and wasn&apos;t exposed to much art other than watching movies once a week. My father wanted me to have a respectable profession. Teaching was respectable to him. He said: &quot;Get a degree and teach in university.&quot; When I wasn&apos;t working he would say: &quot;What are you going to do? Are you going to set an example for your kids?&quot; But I just wanted to make movies, so I never fulfilled the hopes he had for me. Even when I was successful, he would say: &quot;Now it&apos;s time to do something real.&quot; My mother, Se-Tsung, was very submissive with my father and obedient. I don&apos;t have many issues with her: she was a very good mother to me and my siblings. When I was growing up, women didn&apos;t matter as much. It was patriarchal, all about the father. Everyone tried to please my father. As a kid I could not really concentrate on books or homework. I did OK to poorly at school because I would fantasise all the time, having a lot of fun in my head because I didn&apos;t have a lot of fun. It took 35 years to release all that energy. I was repressed and then that repression was released when I became a filmmaker. When I had my own family I was different because I didn&apos;t want to do that to my own kids, so I am fun. My wife [Jane Lin, a microbiologist] is the tiger mom in the home, the wise one in the family. I am like the third kid at home. She makes all the rules. We [our two sons, Mason, an actor, and Haan, an artist] obey. Before I got work as a director, my wife worked. I was lucky, my wife provided for the family herself, and never asked me to find a job. I was picking up the kids from school and doing the cooking and writing. Most of the time I didn&apos;t do anything \u2013 there was a lot of anxiety because I couldn&apos;t invest in anything apart from filmmaking. My kids are interested in what I do. Haan is very good at drawing. He wants to be a graphic artist or a graphic novelist. But he went through a period, which I went through myself, that on the surface looked like he was being inert and lazy. I couldn&apos;t figure out what he was up to, so I said, &quot;Do some drawing for me.&quot; On Life of Pi, one of our concept artists dropped out of the production so my son stepped in and did some wonderful artwork for us \u2013 he designed Pi&apos;s life raft. He&apos;s 23, but he still has a kid kind of head, which was great because he just put some chopsticks and a ring together and made a triangular raft. I left Taiwan to come to America to study drama and then returned home to make the biggest movie I&apos;ve made. It was very emotional for me filming Life of Pi in Taiwan. Everybody wanted to help and make it happen. There was a lot of spiritual encouragement and financial help, and they invested a lot of love in me. It was like coming full circle, going back there. It was a visit and a homecoming. Taiwan is like my floating island. It is an island that&apos;s not recognised as a country; it doesn&apos;t have a definite identity. It&apos;s a very special political situation there: everything&apos;s undecided. Floating. It&apos;s an island, it&apos;s oceanic and I&apos;ve been adrift, floating like Pi, all my life. I think we all have to grow up and detach from our parents and become independent, whether we like it or not. We all have that moment of lost innocence and in other ways we refuse to grow up. We want to remain kids and I don&apos;t think anybody ever really grows up. They always have the kiddie\u00a0part inside them even though they have to face the facts of life and\u00a0mature. People ask me why I make different types of film: Jane Austen, Brokeback Mountain, and The Hulk. If we had a choice, we&apos;d have many lovers instead of sticking to one marriage. I don&apos;t get to do that in life [he laughs]. I have been married to the same woman. I love doing different types of film. My work is all consuming. Over the years we&apos;ve become used to it. When I am working, my family have to see it not as selfish but that we are doing something together for the audience or for humankind, whatever \u2013 they have things in their lives too. But I think there are two types of family relationships. One is the physical time you&apos;re together. The other I think of as spiritual. We all believe in something that can bind us together. My family is interested in what I do. A work of art can be uplifting, and I think my family sees the value of that. \u2022 Life of Pi is out on Blu-ray and DVD\u00a0from 29 April"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/29/iron-man-3-storms-box-office", "publicationDate": "2013-04-29T12:38:09Z", "tags": ["Iron Man 3", "Action and adventure", "Science fiction and fantasy", "Robert Downey Jr", "Ben Kingsley", "Gwyneth Paltrow", "Culture", "Film", "Superhero movies", "The Avengers"], "sentences": ["It broke all-time opening weekend records in Argentina, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore."], "title": "Iron Man 3 storms box office with US yet to come", "article": "     The superhero sequel Iron Man 3 opened with $195.3m (\u00a3125.6m) at the global box office this weekend, placing the film on course to surpass the $1.5m haul secured by last year&apos;s highest-grossing movie, The Avengers. The total is all the more impressive because the $200m Marvel Studios film, which stars Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Kingsley, has not yet opened in the US. It is by far the largest opening of any film of 2013 so far, ahead of Oz the Great and Powerful&apos;s $149m in March.

The previous Iron Man film, Iron Man 2, managed only $623.9m in 2010, so the spectacular success of Joss Whedon&apos;s ensemble superhero film has clearly boosted output dramatically for Marvel&apos;s other fare. Iron Man 3 opened in the UK on Thursday, where it immediately flew to No 1 at the box office with a $21.5m opening. It broke all-time opening weekend records in Argentina, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. Iron Man 3 has also yet to open in China, where it is expected to do well thanks to the presence of a special Chinese cut featuring local actors and scenes, and Russia.

Thomas, founder and director of Sian Elin, switched from a career as a children&apos;s book designer to start the online boutique in September 2012 \u2013 offering home interior products such as cushions, tea towels and wallpaper in her own bold, vibrant and contemporary patterns \u2013 as well as birthday and other greetings cards. Helped by grants from the Arts Council of Wales and free business courses from the Welsh government she took the leap straight into business, rather than taking the master&apos;s degree course in pattern design she had been considering. The first grant helped with the costs of exhibiting at the Tent show in London in October 2012, where she launched her business and showcased her designs \u2013 inspired by her travels to the east (she has lived in Israel and made regular trips to India) filtered through a western eye to give them a &quot;clean, modern, Scandinavian&quot; look. Thomas used to get all her textiles digitally printed and sewn up in a factory near Manchester. But while the digital printing is still done in the north of England, she gets all her textiles sewn up by skilled independent local craftspeople near her Cardiff base \u2013 a move which she says has improved the efficiency of her business in three main areas. For starters it has improved stock control. Once the fabric has been printed, Thomas can get her products sewn up locally as and when needed. This means faster delivery times for customers, lower capital risk as products are not made up if they are not going to be sold, and lower storage costs. Secondly, the move has given Thomas greater control over the quality of the finished product. Having face-to-face relationships with the same few local craftspeople means that any problems can be addressed and rectified much more quickly and easily. Finally, the shift has reduced Thomas&apos;s unit costs. It costs less to have the products made up locally and bulk postage costs have been significantly reduced. In addition to the efficiency benefits to her own business, Thomas says the move also helps her support the local economy and community. &quot;South Wales valleys used to be home to thriving textile manufacturing, but in recent times the skills have been outsourced further afield,&quot; said Thomas. &quot;Employing local skills means we support our local economy and workforce. We don&apos;t want to see those skills die, we want them to live on in Wales and in Britain.&quot; Thomas sells through her own website but also does a significant proportion of her trade through Not on the High Street. Her products are also stocked in a number of small shops in the area and in a couple of outlets in France and Taiwan. She plans to expand her range of kitchen textiles to include tea cosies and oven gloves and has her sights set on seeing Sian Elin products stocked in major department stores. &quot;John Lewis is my dream,&quot; she says.

But the combination of Mangum&apos;s songwriting and the band&apos;s crashing psychedelic folk turned In the Aeroplane Over the Sea into a cult hit, ranked fourth in a Pitchfork poll of the best albums of all time. Mangum all but disappeared after Neutral Milk Hotel dissolved. A decade went by before he played another concert, in Brooklyn in December 2010. He has since performed on a handful of solo tours, including gigs at the Coachella festival and Occupy New York, and curated one of last year&apos;s All Tomorrow&apos;s Parties festivals in Minehead.

So far, the virus, known as H7N9, is being transmitted only to humans from chickens, but there are worries that it could mutate into a form that could be passed from one person to another. Five mutations are known to be necessary for that to happen \u2013 H7N9 already has two of them. If that occurred, it could spread worldwide with lethal effect. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there have been 126 cases of H7N9 bird flu, all but one of which were diagnosed in China, with the other in Taiwan in a man who had travelled from China. So far, 24 people have died from the disease. &quot;The cases are going up daily \u2013 about 20% have died, 20% have recovered and the rest are still sick,&quot; said Prof John McCauley, director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza at the MRC National Institute for Medical Research in London. &quot;The WHO considers this a serious threat. We&apos;re on an alert and we&apos;re developing diagnostics and vaccines specifically against the virus.&quot; The first comprehensive genetic analysis of the virus was published in the Lancet medical journal on Wednesday. It suggests that the virus might have originated from the mixing of viruses from as many as four different origins, including ducks. &quot;Extensive global surveillance is needed,&quot; say the authors. One of the biggest problems is that the virus does not cause illness in chickens, so it is impossible to know which are infected and which are not. In the past, China has slaughtered flocks to eradicate bird flu viruses. Surveillance for H7N9 is taking place in all 31 provinces of China. The first human cases were notified over the Easter weekend. &quot;Whenever an influenza virus jumps across from its animal host to human, it is cause for concern,&quot; said Prof Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust major overseas programme in Vietnam. &quot;This particular one has to be taken calmly, but seriously.&quot; There is concern about the swift rise in cases \u2013 and there\u00a0may\u00a0be more undetected cases if some people suffer less severe illness that\u00a0does\u00a0not get reported, he said, speaking by telephone from Vietnam to a scientific\u00a0briefing on H7N9 in London. The virus has not been in the human population before. Unlike swine flu, it is affecting small children and the elderly alike, so the oldest generation does not have any inherited immunity to it. Public health experts are most concerned about the possibility of human-to-human spread. &quot;The longer the virus is unchecked in circulation, the higher the probability that this virus will start transmitting from person to person,&quot; said Prof Colin Butte of the Avian Viral Immunology Group at the Pirbright Institute. Preparations are being made to design and manufacture a vaccine, but that could take many months. Scientists are aware that a proportion of the public is now sceptical about the risk of a flu pandemic, following the 2009 swine flu outbreak, which turned out to be less serious than was feared. As it receded, there were questions over the stockpiling of vaccines and flu drugs. There had been many discussions about avoiding the mistakes that had been made in 2009, said Farrar. This time, he said, &quot;I think there was a risk of cynicism and inertia [on the part of policy-makers]. I think, thankfully, we are not seeing that.&quot; Letters have gone out to all doctors in the UK to alert them to the flu outbreak in China because of the possibility that they might see a patient who was infected there. Dr John Watson, head of respiratory diseases at Public Health England said that the UK still has plenty of drugs against flu from the swine flu pandemic. &quot;We do have a stockpile of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) which was built up prior to the 2009 pandemic. It is my understanding that the way that stockpile was established enabled it to be refreshed in a way that it remains in date,&quot; he said. The 2009 swine flu pandemic was caused by the virus H1N1, which was a combination \u2013 or reassortment \u2013 of bird, swine and human flu viruses. Over the winter there were high numbers of cases, but fewer deaths in the UK than anticipated and there were accusations that the WHO and the UK government had unnecessarily frightened people. An earlier form of bird flu caused by the virus H5N1 has been circulating since 2003 and has caused the deaths of poultry across Asia, Africa and Europe. But it has not been easily transmissible to humans. In January, the WHO said there had been 583 confirmed cases of H5N1 in humans and 344 deaths. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 May 2013. The original said H7N9 was known to be present in chickens in all 31 provinces of China. Prof Farrar has since clarified that surveillance work for H7N9 is going on in all 31 provinces, rather than cases having been confirmed in all of them."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/01/sony-senior-management-give-up-bonuses", "publicationDate": "2013-05-01T18:39:35Z", "tags": ["Sony", "Technology", "World news"], "sentences": ["Faced with increasing competition from rivals in South Korea and Taiwan, Sony&apos;s TV sales failed to turn a profit last year for a ninth consecutive year."], "title": "Sony senior management give up bonuses worth \u00a36.6m", "article": "Dozens of executives at Sony have agreed to forgo bonuses worth an estimated \u00a51bn (\u00a36.6m) after failing to return the firm&apos;s ailing consumer electronics division to profit.

Each time I try to explain what I research, my mind skims through the intricacies of a definition that is neither precise nor finite in scope. In interviews in Singapore and throughout Taiwan and over the last four months, I have asked social entrepreneurs their definition of social enterprise, and social innovation. Here&apos;s my latest conclusion: it doesn&apos;t really matter. Each foundation, social enterprise, or funding agency I have interviewed has defined social innovation in the positive; no one has decidedly excluded an organisation or group from their view of social innovation. The definition of social entrepreneurship has been more precise, favouring a focus on financial sustainability (&quot;a capitalist mind and a socialist heart&quot; in the words of entrepreneur Priya Chen from Aurora Social Enterprise Co), but most people still give open and growing definitions of a field, sector and way of thinking that is expansive in its ambition to tackle pressing social problems. Amid this lack of clarity on definitional issues, examining whom social innovations serve is perhaps a more important way of analysing social innovation capacity: it shows you who is empowered to solve social problems within a local economy. Does social innovation happen with government, non-profit organisations, or members of the marginalised communities themselves? Here in Taiwan, social innovation and social enterprise seem to concentrate on specific thematic issues, predominantly employment, disability inclusion and matters related to aboriginal communities, rather than taking place in one specific sector. However, it&apos;s hard to tell whether the prevalence of social innovations in these areas is because of truly innovative solutions stemming from those sectors, or is the result of prevalent subsidies. Indeed, the availability of subsidies in those areas could also be considered a kind of social innovation, because they empower those with a vested interest in crafting and delivering a solution. The role of government policy and funding in dictating where social innovation takes place can be significant in the absence of a strong pool of social entrepreneurs. In Singapore, many of the most prominent social enterprises do not focus on issues facing exclusively Singapore. Many organisations, like the World Toilet Organisation, are global in their reach. However, Jack Sim, the dynamic founder of WTO, began his work focused on what he noticed as an issue in Singapore before extending his mandate and forming the WTO. Perhaps, then, what is unique about Singapore is not the nature of its social challenges or marginalised communities, but that its ecosystem and economy are structured to be outward-facing and conducive to growth. It is easier to imagine this sort of structure functioning in a city-state of five million people than a country with greater size and population. The differences in whom social innovations serve in different environments makes the lack of standard definition meaningful: with one definition, it might be easier to unify people working within or across similar subject matter, but more difficult to unify those working under different constraints and in different environments. In South Korea, the Leveraging Social Enterprise Act quantitatively evaluates social enterprises, and businesses cannot use the moniker without being registered. There may be some value in such an approach to limit the novelty of &quot;social enterprise&quot; as a buzzword (if not as a technical understanding of the sector); five years ago, &quot;international&quot; was the buzzword among organisations and government ministries. Now &quot;innovation&quot; has taken the helm \u2013 a desirable word to describe oneself, yet a difficult one to measure against. By repeatedly asking what social innovation is, I&apos;ve seen that the best social innovations and the social entrepreneurs behind them all have laser-sharp focus on their end users and solving their pains, and that they prize financial sustainability so they can keep doing it. Precise definitions and tailored taxation models might be helpful, but they&apos;re not critical to identify effectively and leverage social enterprise opportunities, and are not what will inspire the next generation of change makers. So how do we harness the ambiguity of social innovation? Governments could begin by making it easier for innovation entities \u2013 social enterprises, social purpose businesses, revenue-generating non-profits and innovation entities within larger organizations \u2013 to have the flexibility they need to succeed. Social innovators need to continue drawing outside the lines without being placed in government-approved buckets that do not accurately capture the type of work they do. Practitioners can begin to talk about social innovation in terms of metrics, such as community engagement and sustainability, and the media and academics can spend less time glorifying organisations for merely associating with &quot;innovation&quot; and praise real efforts toward testing new financial model and learning sharing between organisations. So, after all the questioning, it turns out that I don&apos;t care about the definition. Please, join the &quot;social innovation&quot; bandwagon. But there should be standardised metrics, there should be reporting, and we should begin to see social innovation in terms of the communities they serve and not just how its defined.

According to Zhang Haipeng and Li Guoqiang from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, &quot;the time has come to reconsider unresolved issues concerning the Ryukyu islands&quot;. The two academics went on to examine the 1895 treaty of Shimonoseki, which ended the first Sino-Japanese war of 1894-1895, lost by the Manchu Qing dynasty at a time when it was very weak. This &quot;unequal&quot; treaty obliged China to cede a great deal of territory to the &quot;imperialist power&quot;, including the island of Formosa, now Taiwan, and was a source of deep and lasting humiliation for the Chinese. The disputed subtropical archipelago lies between Japan and Taiwan, and in the course of its history was a vassal state of China, paying tribute for years before coming under Japanese sovereignty. The tiny, but independent and prosperous, kingdom became the Okinawa prefecture in 1879. The Ryukyuans had shared a long history with China and many suffered after the island&apos;s annexation, being treated as second-class citizens. The islands were the theatre of intense combat during the second world war, when large numbers of the Ryukyu population were killed and many others were allegedly forced to take their own lives by the Japanese. The United States then occupied the islands until 1972, and the Okinawans have had to accept the presence of American military bases to this day. The calls over Okinawa may well revive tensions between Beijing and Tokyo, already embroiled in a territorial dispute over the Senkaku islands, an archipelago in the South China Sea that China refers to as the Diaoyu islands.   \u2022 This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/may/16/google-io-samsung-profits-heins", "publicationDate": "2013-05-16T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "sentences": ["Taiwan tries to regain its lead in consumer electronics &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com  As notebooks and other Windows-based PCs have lost ground, first to Apple tablets and now to Android-based designs, even Microsoft has been indicating dissatisfaction with the pace of PC innovation in Taiwan.", "&quot;The Surface tablet is a pretty strong signal to the whole Taiwan PC ecosystem that they&apos;re not innovating enough,&quot; said Bill Whyman, a senior managing director at the ISI research firm.", "One exception to Taiwan&apos;s difficulties is Asus.", "The self-criticism within Taiwan seems to be that &quot;we do not pursue a perfect solution; we pursue a good enough solution.&quot; PC market in western Europe declined 20.5% in first quarter of 2013 &gt;&gt; Gartner  PC shipments in Western Europe totaled 12.3m units in the first quarter of 2013, a decline of 20.5% from the corresponding period of 2012, according to Gartner."], "title": "Boot up: Google I/O, Android profit share, Thorsten Heins v PCs, and more", "article": "A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Google I/O: the liveblog &gt;&gt; Guardian Technology Amanda Holpuch at the keyboard, with Dominic Rushe checking the audience for Jon Hamm sightings.

Google to Samsung: Thanks for the cool phone, now we&apos;ve fixed it &gt;&gt; CITEworld Matt Rosoff:   Beginning on June 26, Google will start selling through the Google Play store a version of the Samsung Galaxy S4 that basically strips all the Samsung-specific features out of it. Instead, it ships with the latest version of Android - 4.2.2., a recent update to Android &quot;Jelly Bean&quot; - and the &quot;Nexus experience&quot; that shipped on the Nexus 4, which was manufactured by HTC, last fall. The phone is unlocked, so users can switch carriers, and &quot;bootloader unlocked,&quot; which means users can easily install their own software on it. And Google promises that it will push the latest updates of Android to it as they come out. Sounds great, right? But you&apos;ll pay for the privilege - because it&apos;s unlocked, there&apos;s no carrier subsidy, which means users have to pay the full smartphone price of $649. In other words, this is a phone for Android fans and developers who want cutting-edge hardware combined with the latest, most Google-friendly version of Android. Not a consumer product.  Thorsten Heins: the only exec in the mobile biz that gets post-PC &gt;&gt; ZDNet Matthew Baxter-Reynolds:   On the one hand, you have a CEO who seems to understand ideas around the death of the PC, relationship-centric computing, post-PC, etc., but seems keen to actively avoid pushing his vision into the tablet space. If tablets are going to be replaced by some modular computing doodad or doodads, surely [BlackBerry CEO Thorsten] Heins would like to be the one to tell everyone how it would be done? But there isn&apos;t any leadership from Heins in this direction. I get that marketing is complex and it&apos;s not a good thing to confuse, but if Heins is talking with authority about the tablet going away, surely it would be a good idea for him and his team to set the tone of that discussion with more clarity.  Heins seems to simultaneously understand post-PC (that the desktop stops being the dominant way to do computing) and to not get it (you need more and discrete devices). Taiwan tries to regain its lead in consumer electronics &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com  As notebooks and other Windows-based PCs have lost ground, first to Apple tablets and now to Android-based designs, even Microsoft has been indicating dissatisfaction with the pace of PC innovation in Taiwan. Despite a longtime aversion to hardware, Microsoft recently introduced its own Surface tablet. &quot;The Surface tablet is a pretty strong signal to the whole Taiwan PC ecosystem that they&apos;re not innovating enough,&quot; said Bill Whyman, a senior managing director at the ISI research firm. One exception to Taiwan&apos;s difficulties is Asus. Its many new Android-based tablets, including one that it has branded with Google, allowed it to surpass Amazon in the first quarter of this year to become the third-largest player in the global tablet computer market, behind Apple and Samsung, according to IDC.  The self-criticism within Taiwan seems to be that &quot;we do not pursue a perfect solution; we pursue a good enough solution.&quot; PC market in western Europe declined 20.5% in first quarter of 2013 &gt;&gt; Gartner  PC shipments in Western Europe totaled 12.3m units in the first quarter of 2013, a decline of 20.5% from the corresponding period of 2012, according to Gartner. &quot;The first quarter of 2013 brought the worst quarterly decline in Western Europe since Gartner started tracking PC shipments in this region,&quot; said Meike Escherich, principal research analyst at Gartner. &quot;Wide availability of Windows 8-based PCs could not boost consumer PC purchases during the quarter. Although the new Metro-style user interface suits new form factors, users wonder about its suitability for traditional PCs \u2014 non-touchscreen desktops and notebooks.&quot; All PC segments in Western Europe exhibited year-on-year declines in the first quarter of 2013. Mobile and desktop PC shipments fell by 24.6% and 13.8%, respectively. Shipments to the professional PC market declined by 17.2%, while those to the consumer PC market decreased by 23.7%.  So the consumer market declined more than the professional, and the mobile sector by more than the desktop. Only Lenovo and Apple grew sales in absolute terms - and barely at all even then. As of today, every major mobile competitor... also makes apps for iOS &gt;&gt; iMore.com Rene Ritchie:   every single one of Apple&apos;s major mobile competitors now makes apps for iOS. Google, who also has Android, makes many very popular apps including Gmail, Maps, Google+, etc. Microsoft, who also has Windows Phone, makes a bunch of apps and games for iOS, including OneNote and Kinnectimals. Nokia, Microsoft&apos;s primary Windows Phone partner, also makes Here Maps. Now, BlackBerry makes BBM. Apple, by contrast, makes precisely nothing for Android, Windows Phone, or BlackBerry. Not even iTunes.  It would be fascinating to see this as a grid. (Also perhaps &quot;platform competitors&quot; would be better.)

Ten days ago, a Philippine coast guard ship went too far in chasing off a Taiwanese fishing vessel in disputed waters. Such actions involve water cannons and the damage is nothing worse than a few broken portholes. This time the coast guard ship loosed off 54 rounds into the side of the Taiwanese boat and killed a fisherman. The Philippines&apos; National Bureau of Investigation launched an inquiry. A\u00a0spokesmen for President Benigno S Aquino III said that a representative would convey &quot;deep\u00a0regret and apology&quot; to the family of the dead fisherman. But all of this fell short of an official apology. Taiwan was having none of it. It gave Manila 72 hours to apologise, failing which it would withdraw its representative and end the visa regime for Filipino workers. All of which it has now done, throwing in a two-day military drill in the channel which divides the two countries, for good measure. On Friday, the Philippine envoy to Taiwan advised Filipino workers there to avoid the streets, as emotions are running high. Then came the second surprise: China applauded. The dispute has been running high on the evening news. Commentators have denounced the Philippines and applauded Taiwan&apos;s resolute response. To receive Beijing&apos;s approbation is something of a novelty for Taiwan. Cross-strait relations may be at their warmest for 60 years, (there are now more scheduled flights from Taipei to cities on the mainland than there are from Hong Kong), but even so. Any time Taiwan acts independently in the international arena, Beijing reverts to the orthodoxy of its One China policy. When Taiwan&apos;s president, Ma Ying-jeou, reached a pragmatic fishing deal with Japan, which might defuse the tension around the disputed islands which Japan calls the Senkakus and Taiwan knows as the Diaoyutai, China expressed its wrath \u2013 but all of it was pointed at Japan, rather than Taipei. The fishing deal could be used as a template for other disputes. It side-steps the sovereignty debate by establishing a large area around the islands \u2013 74,300 sq km, or twice the size of Taiwan itself \u2013 as a jointly managed fishing ground. Japan maintains its territorial waters around the islands, which Taiwanese fishermen cannot enter. But they get in return an area far beyond the 200 miles they once claimed as their exclusive economic zone. These talks have been brewing a long time. There have been 16 rounds of negotiation since 1996. The 17th may have finally been clinched by China&apos;s recent naval assertiveness, about which both Japan and Taiwan are wary. By hook or by crook, Taiwan is winning for itself greater regional influence under a leader criticised at home as being too pro-Chinese."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/23/microsoft-surface-pro-review", "publicationDate": "2013-05-23T06:55:00Z", "tags": ["Microsoft Surface", "Microsoft", "Tablet computers", "Windows 8", "Software", "Internet", "Cloud computing", "Technology", "UK news", "US news"], "sentences": ["Intel will start with high-end Core i7 chips, perhaps at the Computex trade show in Taiwan in early June, but the low-power versions may not arrive much before Christmas."], "title": "Microsoft Surface Pro review: a device of many talents", "article": "Microsoft created a stir when it unveiled its first two tablets \u2013 Surface RT and Surface Pro \u2013 at a mystery press conference in Los Angeles on 19 June last year. Indeed, it was something of a shock, because for the first time, Microsoft was competing against its biggest customers: Windows PC suppliers such as Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung and Toshiba.            The good news is that the Surface Pro is finally being released in the UK \u2013 it went on sale at midnight on Thursday. The bad news is that 11 months on, it&apos;s the same Surface Pro. My guess is that Microsoft is following Apple in trying to sell products on their capabilities and style, rather than the usual tech specs and discounted prices. This could be tough at a time when the free Windows 8.1 &quot;Blue&quot; update and Intel&apos;s next generation of Core processors, codenamed Haswell, are just coming into view. The Surface Pro is a 2lb (903g) hybrid PC (the Surface RT is 676g) that appeals in four different ways: \u2022 Surface Pro is a tablet designed to work with Windows 8&apos;s touch-first user interface and new-style apps, which are downloaded from the Windows Store. In this respect, its responsiveness is a big improvement over the Samsung slate that software developers and many journalists used during the Windows 8 beta test. \u2022 Surface Pro is a full-scale Windows PC with an Intel Core i5 processor, 4GB of memory, and 64GB or 128GB solid-state drive (SSD). Add a Touch or Type keyboard cover, flip out the kickstand and you have the equivalent of an Ultrabook, though it&apos;s a bit tricky to balance on your knees. \u2022 Surface Pro is a slate that comes with a digitising pen that you can use for on-screen drawing, handwriting recognition, filling in forms and so on. There has been a small but steady market for slates for commercial, industrial and health industry applications since the GRiDPad arrived, running Microsoft MS-DOS for Pen Computing, way back in 1989. \u2022 Surface Pro is tough, thanks to its unique VaporMg construction. Microsoft dropped a Surface onto the floor during its launch and Steve Sinofsky, former head of Windows, added wheels and used one as a skateboard. It&apos;s an obvious choice for field workers, police and even military applications. Some companies are already buying. For example, if you&apos;ve had OpenReach broadband technicians visiting your home or office with Panasonic ToughBooks running Windows XP, you can expect to see them using Microsoft Surfaces instead. There are some benefits to the four-in-one design, and some drawbacks, so you will have to decide whether a Surface Pro matches your needs as well as your pocket.  The benefits: if you are mostly mobile, if you can do much of your work using commercial or in-house Windows 8 apps, and if you need a tablet that works with \u2013 in Microsoft&apos;s phrase \u2013 &quot;your existing enterprise management infrastructure&quot; (including Active Directory), then the Surface Pro is a very attractive product. If you need a robust machine, albeit one that&apos;s not fully sealed, it&apos;s cheap compared to the phones and PDAs sold for industrial use. Also, if you want to switch between full PC power and tablet convenience without moving files between devices, the Surface Pro does that well. It&apos;s great for running Adobe Lightroom as a desktop program before viewing photos using tablet apps. The drawbacks: if you want a PC to run traditional Windows XP/7 programs, and if you do most of your work with a keyboard, then it&apos;s not a good choice. A Surface Pro will do the job, but an Ultrabook or traditional laptop would be better value. Also, if your tablet requirements can be satisfied by a small, cheap Google Android or similar device, then the Surface Pro is a bigger, heavier, and much more expensive option. If you want a 15.6in laptop and a 7in tablet, the Surface Pro falls awkwardly between the two.     Microsoft Surface Pro: comes with a digitising pen. Photograph: Microsoft    Hardware features At first glance, the Surface Pro looks exactly like the ARM-based Surface RT, which is already on sale in the UK, and it takes the same Touch and Type keyboard covers. Up close, however, you notice it&apos;s thicker (13.5mm v 9.3mm) and heavier (903g v 676g). The giveaway is a thin vent that goes round the outside of the case to allow heat from the Core i5 to escape. The left edge of the Surface Pro has a single USB 3.0 port, a rocker switch for volume control, and an audio jack. The right edge has a microSD card slot, a Mini DisplayPort, and a magnetic socket that connects to a charger and doubles as a holder for the digitising pen. The top edge has a tiny on/off button, while the bottom edge has magnetic connectors to snap in the keyboard covers. The front of the Surface Pro has a 720p HD webcam above the 10-point multi-touch screen and a Windows Start button below it. The back has another webcam and a kickstand, which hides various bits of labelling. The 48-watt battery is sealed inside. Other features include an ambient light sensor, an accelerometer and a gyroscope. The small power supply has an extra 5W USB port so you can charge another device at the same time. For a tablet, the Surface Pro has an impressive range of connections. For a Windows laptop, it&apos;s minimalist, though it&apos;s similar to some Ultrabooks. It is missing an RJ45 Ethernet port for a wired internet connection, one or two USB 2.0 ports, an HDMI port, a full SD card slot, and a SIM slot for a 3G or 4G mobile connection. If you want to use it with a separate keyboard, mouse and monitor, you may want to buy a USB 3.0 dock as an extender, though you could also use the Mini DisplayPort for the screen and buy a Bluetooth keyboard. I transferred files from SD cards using a small USB converter (\u00a31 from a handy Poundland). If I owned a Surface Pro, I&apos;d probably buy a large microSD card to bump up the built-in storage. Although it&apos;s glossy and not very big, the 10.6in ClearType 16:9 widescreen is one of the best things about the Surface Pro. It&apos;s very sharp, has great blacks, and a Full HD resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. In tablet format, it&apos;s great for catch-up TV using the BBC&apos;s iPlayer in the IE10 browser.  Software and services As you&apos;d expect, the Surface Pro comes with Windows 8 pre-installed, and this works beautifully in tablet mode. The experience is better than smartphones (which use Windows Phone, of course) and other tablets I&apos;ve tried, including the Surface RT. Given that it&apos;s running on a Core i5 with 4GB of memory, of course, it should be. Unlike most tablets, you can run two apps snapped together on the same screen, so you can run Twitter alongside a streaming video, for example. Also unlike most tablets, you can give your spouse and or parents/children their own guest accounts, and they can have touch-based picture log-ins to avoid typing. With normal Windows XP/7 programs, the performance is smooth but not noticeably better than you&apos;d expect. The Surface Pro scores 5.6 on the open-ended Windows Experience Index, where the limitation is the Core i5&apos;s built-in Intel HD4000 graphics. Otherwise, the processor scores 6.9, the memory 5.9, and the solid-state drive (SSD) 8.1. The gaming graphics score of 6.4 suggests it will run some serious games, though not to the level of a typical PC gaming rig. It&apos;s more than good enough for Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja and similar game apps downloaded from the Windows Store.  Although there&apos;s no crapware, the Surface Pro does come with a number of preinstalled Microsoft apps. These include Skype, SkyDrive, Mail, Maps, Weather, Photos, and Bing apps for News, Sport, Travel and Finance. The Bing apps are excellent, and really show the value of devoting the full screen area to content. Microsoft also offers a free Fresh Paint app for download, though Microsoft Paint is still provided as a desktop program. The free Microsoft Office OneNote app is also worth having. The Photo app can consolidate photos from the picture library on the Surface Pro, and from SkyDrive, Facebook and Flickr.  The Live Tiles for Games, Music and Video are fronts for Xbox Live services, and should appeal to people who use the same services on an Xbox games console or Windows Phone smartphone. If you&apos;re doing something on one device, you can pick it up and continue on another.  Storage furore When the Surface tablets appeared, there was a minor furore over the amount of free storage, compounded by the fact that drive manufacturers use decimal instead of binary counting. Your 500GB (billion byte) hard drive, for example, only holds 465.65GB of actual files (counting 1KB = 1024 byte, 1MB = 1024KB, and so on). My loan Surface Pro machine had a 128GB Samsung SSD which provided 110.7GB of user storage space, of which 85GB (76%) was free. There were three hidden partitions: 200MB for the EUFI secure boot system, and two recovery partitions taking up 7.62GB and 600MB. These enable users to refresh or restore the operating system if they run into problems. Storage isn&apos;t a problem with the 128GB version, but anyone buying a 64GB Surface Pro should be aware that only about 25GB (or less) will be available for storing files, and they may need to use removable microSD cards. With the growing use of network-attached servers (NAS) and cloud storage, it shouldn&apos;t be a major problem. For IT departments, Windows 8 supports storage pools with thin provisioning, like Windows Server 2012. Some observations\u2026. The Surface Pro shows an impressive attention to detail, and works really well as a portable PC and an armchair tablet. It&apos;s not perfect, of course, and some things could be improved. Screen: combine high resolution with a small screen, and Windows features can look tiny. The Surface Pro ships with 150% scaling pre-set, which is mostly OK as long as Windows programs scale correctly; not all of them do. Incidentally, the screen has a pixel density of 208ppi, which is a &quot;retina screen&quot; at a viewing distance of 17 inches (43cm). Pen: the digitising pen turned out to be much more useful than I expected. You can capture your handwriting and annotate documents in OneNote (as you could in Windows XP Tablet Edition a decade ago), and this is a great feature for meetings and jotting things down in front of the TV set. The pen also comes in useful as a mouse substitute when dealing with tiny icons in Windows desktop programs. But it would be nice if the pen fitted inside the Surface Pro rather than attaching via the magnets provided for recharging. Battery life: I normally use a long-life laptop that nominally provides 12 hours of battery life. As this gives about eight hours of real usage, I was somewhat apprehensive about the Surface Pro&apos;s five-hour battery life. In fact, I always got at least five hours of word processing and web browsing with Wi-Fi on, a bright screen and a balanced (rather than battery-saving) power scheme. This was enough for most purposes, but you may need to pack the charger. Instant on: Windows PCs have usually been laggards at opening and closing down, but the Surface Pro&apos;s fast start system works well enough for tablet use. Waking it up first thing in the morning takes about six or eight seconds. After that, it appears to turn off instantly (the screen blanks), and it turns on in about two seconds. It takes longer than that to type in a password, which is why I set up picture passwords with quick taps. Apps: Being new, the Windows Store doesn&apos;t have as many apps as the Apple and Google Android stores. Still, the selection includes Netflix, 4oD, TuneIn Radio, Shazam, Dropbox, Evernote Touch, Adobe Reader Touch and almost 150,000 more. Of course, where apps are missing, you can load IE10 and go to the website using the full power of a PC.     Microsoft Surface Pro: the kickstand has its drawbacks. Photograph: Microsoft    Kickstand: this works if you have a table or other flat surface, though I stopped trying to use it on my knees: for quick access you just lay the screen flat and have the keyboard at an angle. The drawback with the kickstand is that, on a table, the screen angle is fixed. The advantage is that the front- and rear-facing cameras are then aligned correctly, but I often wanted the screen tilted further back. The workaround is to prop up the front with a book, or whatever. The kickstand wins for simplicity and portability, but it loses on adjustability. Keyboard covers: almost everyone will buy a flat Touch or keyboard-style Type cover to go with their Surface Pro, at considerable extra cost (\u00a399.99 or \u00a3109.99). I didn&apos;t like the Touch cover, but the Type cover is surprisingly good. When I tried some online typing tests, my score was an insignificant 1 character per second higher than on my desktop PC. Having grown up with typewriters, I prefer big clicky keys, but the Type cover does the job better than expected. Also, attaching and removing the keyboard is almost instant and you can do it with your eyes shut. Processors and prices The Surface Pro&apos;s estimated UK prices are \u00a3719 for the model with a 64GTB SSD and \u00a3799 for 128GB; that&apos;s without the \u00a3100 keyboard covers. This compares with \u00a3849 and \u00a3929 for the equivalent Apple MacBook Air models, which don&apos;t have touch screens, don&apos;t support digitising pens, and don&apos;t run iPad apps.  I&apos;d like to see a cheaper Surface Pro that uses a slower Intel chip such as a Core i3 or even an Intel Atom, but then it wouldn&apos;t be such a prestige product. I don&apos;t see a way round that conundrum. Either way, the Surface Pro should become faster and possibly cheaper later this year, when Intel launches the fourth-generation Haswell chips designed specifically for Ultrabooks. Haswell promises improved battery life and about twice the graphics performance of the current Ivy Bridge generation. Intel will start with high-end Core i7 chips, perhaps at the Computex trade show in Taiwan in early June, but the low-power versions may not arrive much before Christmas.  It&apos;s a good schedule for companies testing a few Surface Pros before ordering hundreds, but not so good for geeks who want the latest and greatest. Microsoft could sweeten the pot by throwing in a free copy of Microsoft Office, as it does with Surface RT. Otherwise, as mentioned above, value for money depends on what you want to do with your Surface Pro. If you want an Ultrabook, a tablet, and a slate where you can draw on the screen, it&apos;s good value. If you just want a Windows 7 laptop, it&apos;s not. The New Microsoft One thing that&apos;s noticeable with the Surface Pro is that it&apos;s just as much of a Microsoft device as a MacBook is an Apple device, or even more so. To really exploit the system, it&apos;s best to sign in with a Microsoft account on Outlook.com or Office365 and use Microsoft&apos;s powerful cloud-based ecosystem. This includes free Microsoft Office programs in SkyDrive. The cloud also stores your settings so you can have your own Windows 8 set-up by logging into any Windows 8 PC. With Xbox Live music, movies and games services, and apps such as SmartGlass, the ecosystem extends beyond the PC to Windows Phone 8 smartphones and the forthcoming Xbox One entertainment system, which has added some Windows 8 features. Microsoft is now close to delivering a complete ecosystem as envisaged by Ray Ozzie with the mantra of &quot;three screens and a cloud&quot;. (The three screens are the PC, TV and smartphone; the cloud is Azure, hosting a wide range of subscription services.)  Ozzie was Microsoft&apos;s Chief Software Architect from June 2006 to December 2010, which gives you some idea of how long ago the project started, and how long it will take to bring to fruition. Win or bust, it&apos;s a full-blown attempt to transform the company. Microsoft no longer thinks of itself as a software company: it&apos;s now a &quot;a devices and services company&quot;, like Apple. A Surface Pro running Windows 8 is not just another PC, it&apos;s concrete evidence that Microsoft has shifted to what CEO Steve Ballmer calls &quot;a new computing paradigm&quot;. Pros: A light, fast, laptop in a tablet format. Great multi-touch screen with pen input. Well made. Good value if you want a hybrid tablet PC. Cons: Compromises on size: it&apos;s small and light for a PC but big and heavy for a tablet. Sealed unit: it can&apos;t be expanded. Expensive if you don&apos;t need the features."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/23/bugaboo-designer-max-barenbrug-buggy", "publicationDate": "2013-05-23T09:58:15Z", "tags": ["Parents and parenting", "Family", "Life and style", "Design", "Art and design", "Retail industry", "Business"], "sentences": ["Really funny, people cannot think from paper.&quot; In 1999 the product hit the market \u2013 though only after, frustrated by poor-quality parts (and horrified by working conditions they saw elsewhere) Barenbrug and his partner Eduard Zanen had built their own factory in Taiwan."], "title": "Bugaboo designer Max Barenbrug: the master of reinvention", "article": "It may come as a surprise to the archetypical yummy mummy, clad in Brora and pushing her Bonton-clad tot to the yoga class, to learn that the Bugaboo \u2013 the pushchair of choice since Gwyneth Paltrow pushed baby Apple around Manhattan \u2013 was originally designed for men. And, more than that, it was actually a rugged, all-terrain vehicle that hooked up to your bike or cruised up and down mountains. The original idea for the Bugaboo was conceived in 1994, when its Dutch creator, Max Barenbrug \u2013 then a design student in Amsterdam looking for an idea for his graduation project \u2013 saw that parents were having problems getting their children from their bike-carriers into pushchairs. From his second-floor vantage point, with a designer&apos;s eye, he noticed two things. First, the functionality of existing pushchairs was poor. But also, that they were conservative \u2013 blue for boys, pink for girls \u2013 clunky and not very interesting. &quot;It was such a hassle for these parents, that I thought I had to come up to something that would solve that problem for them,&quot; he says. &quot;So I designed a product where you could transform a stroller from four to two wheels, you could pull the seat up above the bike rack and then connect the two together.&quot; &quot;My original design was for men,&quot; he explains. &quot;It was actually inspired by my teacher at the design academy, who was trying to make a more feminine car \u2013 remember the Twingo? \u2013 because at that time everything was extremely tough and meant for men. That trend was not that good for the car business. But for the stroller business, where everything was very feminine, the opposite was actually quite a good idea.&quot; Quite a good idea indeed: revenue in 2011 (the last year available) was \u20ac82m (\u00a370m). The company now has eight offices, employs more than 900 people and sells to 46 countries. Success, though, didn&apos;t happen overnight. When Barenbrug finished his degree and tried to sell his design, no one was interested. &quot;It was quite funny,&quot; he says. &quot;I graduated with honours, got a lot of publicity, but the industry was just not interested. At that time they were even more conservative than they are today. Now they have adopted our design \u2013 they were forced to, really, otherwise we&apos;d probably sell our product all over the place. But back then they didn&apos;t want this new revolutionary design.&quot; So Barenbrug tinkered and tweaked. Put in softer fabrics. Made it less a device to attach to a push-bike and more a straightforward baby stroller with swivel-wheels and a handle more appropriate for tall Dutch men. Straightforward in outline, that is \u2013 not in design. Barenbrug is clearly, even by designer standards, obsessed with details. It&apos;s no coincidence that Bugaboo, despite its success, has actually produced very few models by the standards of its competitors. It has also resisted the temptation to branch out into the many other arms of the baby-paraphernalia market. Not for it the travel cot, the high chair, the mobiles. This is because unless you can truly reinvent it, Barenbrug just isn&apos;t interested: he describes such products, design-wise, as &quot;boring&quot;. Back in 1997, though, he really did seem to have reinvented the all-terrain wheel. &quot;We had this fantastic success at the Cologne Fair,&quot; he recalls. &quot;Everyone who had rejected the previous design suddenly were standing in line to buy us out. That was what I&apos;ve learned as well. If you show a concept, people say, &apos;Uh huh?&apos;; but if you show them a real product then they start understanding. Really funny, people cannot think from paper.&quot; In 1999 the product hit the market \u2013 though only after, frustrated by poor-quality parts (and horrified by working conditions they saw elsewhere) Barenbrug and his partner Eduard Zanen had built their own factory in Taiwan. Barenbrug even designed the production line. The first stroller, the Frog, launched in the UK in 2003, but 2004 proved the tipping point. When Paltrow was photographed with the Bugaboo Frog on the streets of New York, sales exploded. Quickly, the Bugaboo became a fashion trend, a status symbol. For a brand that prizes its high-tech Dutch engineering and usability, does that not prove something of a mixed blessing? &quot;It frustrates me a bit,&quot; Barenbrug concedes. &quot;From the sales-figures perspective I don&apos;t mind at all, of course, but unfortunately it means people don&apos;t understand the product and its features completely.&quot; He elaborates. &quot;Today, many competitors do come close to us, design-wise \u2013 and I mean only the looks \u2013 so if the consumer judges the product only superficially, then it could be to your disadvantage. Because then they just look at the looks then buy your competitor instead of you.&quot; You suspect he&apos;s speaking mainly of iCandy \u2013 frequently referred to as &quot;the new Bugaboo&quot; \u2013 which launched in 2005; and another brand that now goes hand-in-handle with the designer changing bag and attendant lifestyle.     The Missoni design for Bugaboo.    It&apos;s an odd and slightly awkward position to inhabit \u2013 speaking to Barenbrug it&apos;s clear that he cares only about design and functionality \u2013 yet the company has collaborated with with Missoni and Marc Jacobs, which hardly underplay the celebrity angle. When it recently launched the Bugaboo Donkey, with its \u00a31,000 price tag, there was a considerable backlash \u2013 horror at the price, probably exacerbated by the perception that price reflected a sort of &quot;designer-label&quot; ethos. Yet the product really was a genuine innovation (a two-seater that converts to a one-seater, and vice versa), which is likely to spawn copies further down the road. Barenbrug is also irritated by people failing to see \u2013 or use \u2013 the stroller&apos;s true functionality: &quot;You can do a lot of things with this product,&quot; he insists. &quot;It is rugged and versatile enough to go into the mountains, to the beach and you can take the seat out, put it on your back, do something different.&quot; He thinks the backlash reflects this \u2013 if you don&apos;t use what your hefty outlay bought you, why wouldn&apos;t you be frustrated? Actual reviews, most importantly, remain very strong. The consumer company Which has the brand top of its &quot;best pushchair brands&quot; leaderboard, with an average score of 78% (iCandy gets 73%, Maclaren 63%) and rates all four models that it has tested as &quot;best buys&quot;. The Mumsnet community rates them highly too, with user-generated reviews averaging four out of five stars for all models bar the Chameleon3, which gets five. And now the Duchess of Cambridge has bought one \u2013 that&apos;s not merely a celebrity seal of approval but a royal one. So what next for the man who made pushchairs into a status symbol, even if he did it inadvertently? It turns out that Bugaboo may have a surprise up its sleeve. &quot;We have a new innovation that&apos;s got nothing to do with a stroller,&quot; says Barenbrug. &quot;It&apos;s a totally new business where the term mobility is written with a capital. Mobility really is the issue. It will really make the difference, like we did for strollers. Unfortunately I can&apos;t really talk about it.&quot; An intriguing prospect, then, and one that may see another highly coveted, highly fashionable Bugaboo product on our streets."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/may/25/art-hongkong-asia", "publicationDate": "2013-05-25T14:18:29Z", "tags": ["Art", "The art market", "Asia Pacific", "Hong Kong", "World news", "China", "Singapore", "Jake and Dinos Chapman"], "sentences": ["Several British dealers said that Singapore, Taiwan and the Philippines, which are more familiar with western culture, were their most important markets in Asia."], "title": "Art Basel fair woos wealthy Chinese with champagne, logos and singers", "article": "The branding hits as soon as you leave Hong Kong International airport and spot two huge billboards heralding the Asian debut of the world&apos;s most prominent art fair, Art Basel. Amid a PR frenzy that drew the likes of supermodel Kate Moss and Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, it seemed that even the torrential rain and 18,000 lightning strikes across the territory hours before the VIP preview on Wednesday were just part of the city-wide spectacle. There is much familiar about Art Basel in Hong Kong, which runs alongside the original fair in its namesake home city in Switzerland and a sister event in Miami Beach \u2013 not least the sponsors. Trolleys of Ruinart champagne stalk the aisles at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. A BMW &quot;art car&quot; brightly painted by Spanish artist C\u00e9sar Manrique is displayed outside one entrance. Absolut ArtBureau, an offshoot of the vodka drink company, has commissioned an &quot;art bar&quot; by Adrian Wong, in which a Cantonese lounge singer performs with an animatronic band of multi-limbed manga-like creatures, evoking a mix of colonial kitsch and Blade Runner.      Art Basel&apos;s purchase of the previous Art HK fair two years ago led some locals to question whether Hong Kong&apos;s art scene was becoming a post-colonial venture for importing western art into Asia. With China now the world&apos;s second-largest art market after the US, and Asia home to more billionaires than North America, the attraction seems obvious. In recent years, several top commercial western galleries have set up outposts amid the Louis Vuitton and Prada stores in the city&apos;s central business district, including American Larry Gagosian, the world&apos;s richest art dealer, in 2008 and London gallerist Jay Jopling&apos;s White Cube in March 2012. At packed-out private views, both galleries brought out their big guns. White Cube showed the Chapman Brothers&apos; macabre new installation, The Sum of All Evil, vitrines packed with thousands of miniature figures in violent torment; and Gagosian presented paintings by the late New York graffiti artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. But the wooing of the Chinese collectors and their vast wealth is a long, slow process. Most western galleries have yet to convince the big buyers of mainland China, whose taste for contemporary art remains patriotic, according to market analysts. Graham Steele, director of White Cube Hong Kong, said: &quot;The barriers are coming down, but not as fast as western dealers would like them to. There isn&apos;t the cultural momentum yet. The major Chinese collectors come to Hong Kong for Christie&apos;s or Sotheby&apos;s auctions of Chinese art.&quot; US gallery Pace&apos;s Beijing branch, which explicitly declares itself an Asian gallery and runs a different programme from the US and UK branches, has found success by becoming a major dealer for Chinese contemporary artists. Its stand at the fair included work by Zhang Xiaogang, whose paintings have fetched multimillion-pound prices at auction. Several British dealers said that Singapore, Taiwan and the Philippines, which are more familiar with western culture, were their most important markets in Asia. Australians are also major collectors. Ellie Harrison-Read, sales associate at Lisson Gallery, said: &quot;Big names such as Anish Kapoor and Marina Abramovic, people who are familiar, sell well. Brand is very important here.&quot; This seemed to be apparent in big sales of the fair&apos;s first day. London&apos;s Victoria Miro gallery sold a wall-sized painting by Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama for \u00a31.32m and White Cube sold a Gary Hume sculpture for \u00a366,243, while 15 sculptures by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, depicting a cartoon version of the artist and his dog, sold for \u00a389,428 each. The local art scene, which has long felt overshadowed by the Chinese contemporary art boom, has mixed feelings about the influx of international dealers. Pui Pui To, director of 2P gallery, one of Hong Kong&apos;s few art spaces to represent local artists, said: &quot;Now that the blue chip galleries have arrived, it&apos;s become much tougher for us to survive.&quot; Spiralling rents have pushed younger galleries further from the city centre. Pui Pui To&apos;s gallery, which is showing in Art Basel, is on a backstreet in Sai Ying Pun in the city&apos;s western district. &quot;The only brand names round here are McDonald&apos;s and KFC,&quot; she said. However, she praised Art Basel in Hong Kong&apos;s director, Magnus Renfrew, who founded Art HK for supporting the local art scene through educational programmes and collaboration with non-profit, artist-run projects. Renfrew said that when he first arrived in Hong Kong it was referred to as a &quot;cultural desert&quot; with little audience for contemporary art: &quot;Since the fair opened, the number of visitors has grown from just 19,000 in 2008 to 67,000 last year and the gallery scene is more sophisticated.&quot; He believes that the current imbalance between the art market, which has long had a big presence in the territory with Christie&apos;s and Sotheby&apos;s auction houses, will change with the construction of the West Kowloon cultural district, which will include the M+ museum of visual culture, twice the size of Tate Modern, and 16 performing art museums. An outdoor exhibition of inflatable sculptures on the site, M+ mobile, which includes a giant upturned cockroach, a suckling pig you can walk into and British artist Jeremy Deller&apos;s bouncy castle version of Stonehenge, has drawn 130,000 visitors in just three weeks. Lars Nittve, executive director of M+ and the founding director of Tate Modern, compared the exhibition to the sensation caused by Carl Andre&apos;s bricks when they first were shown at the Tate. &quot;Really for the first time in Hong Kong it has provoked public debate about whether something that looks ugly can be art. Can you jump on art? Can art be fun?&quot; Harriet Onslow of Pearl Lam Galleries, based in Hong Kong and Shanghai, thinks there will be room for a wider range of galleries as the art scene diversifies. &quot;Collectors are not going to decide against buying one of [the smaller galleries&apos;] artists for HK$5,000 just because I&apos;ve sold them something for HK$200,000,&quot; she said. However the work of one of the local artists in the Pearl Lam booth suggests that Pui Pui To is not alone in her ambivalance towards the internationalisation of Hong Kong&apos;s art scene. Tsang Kin-wah offers a tongue-in-cheek critique of the art fair system in a text installation in which scathing comments in vinyl lettering spread across the floor like the tentacles of an octopus: &quot;ANYONECANBEANARTISTTHEREFOREANYA$$HOLECANBEANARTIST ANYONECANBEACOLLECTORTHEREFOREANYA$$HOLECANBEACOLLECTOR CREATE$LUXURYARTCREATE$BIGMONEYCREATE$POWERCREATE$BIGMONEY CREATE$BIGNAMECREATE$FAMECREATE$POWER.&quot; Onslow said: &quot;It&apos;s about how fucking awful art fairs are and how it&apos;s no longer about the art but the fair. The text is etched on glass because that signifies how the art and the artist is disappearing.&quot; Yet in the Deutsche Bank&apos;s exclusive VIP room another work by the artist, best known for painting words in English and Chinese in seemingly floral patterns, offers a more positive if rather cynical take, with the phrase &quot;Making Art, Making Money&quot; discernible in the grey text. It seems unlikely that Tsang Kin-wah at least will be disappearing any time soon."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/27/club-med-chinese-investor-private-equity-bid", "publicationDate": "2013-05-27T17:52:53Z", "tags": ["Travel & leisure", "Business", "Private equity", "Mergers and acquisitions", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["Chinese tourists tend to travel to Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau \u2013 where they can gamble legally \u2013 but have started to look further afield."], "title": "Club Med gets \u20ac540m offer from its top investors", "article": "  The Club Med holiday business may want to consider renaming itself Club South China Sea: the French firm is set to be bought out by Chinese and French investors who are targeting China for its future growth. The company is hoping to break into the Chinese holiday market and aims to make the country its second-largest customer base within three years. The \u20ac540m (\u00a3462m) deal sees the French firm&apos;s two biggest shareholders, China&apos;s Fosun International and France&apos;s Axa Private Equity, offering \u20ac17 a share \u2013 a 23% premium to Friday&apos;s close. The share price rose to \u20ac17.02 a share on Monday. Club Med, which has traditionally focused its business in Europe and north Africa, said the approach was &quot;friendly&quot;. It said: &quot;The board took note of the friendly character of this offer. The board will meet again after the delivery of the report by the independent expert to provide its reasoned opinion on the terms of the tender offer.&quot; A joint statement from AXA and Fosun said they wanted to &quot;implement a strategy in line with the difficult environment of the tourism market in Europe, in particular in France. &quot;An acceleration of the development strategy in the emerging countries as well as the strengthening of the market shares in mature markets are necessary.&quot; Henri Giscard d&apos;Estaing, Club Med&apos;s chief executive and son of former French president Val\u00e9ry Giscard d&apos;Estaing, would remain in charge under the terms of the offer. He joined the company in 2002 and turned around its loss-making position after the business suffered from an ill-advised foray into the services sector, away from its traditional upmarket holiday villages. Fosun and Axa have 10% and 9% stakes respectively, and Fosun could play a pivotal role in Club Med&apos;s expansion into China, where it launched its first resort in 2010. Club Med said revenues at its holiday villages in the six months to the end of April fell 6.4%, with bookings in Europe over the last eight weeks down 4.6%, owing to the weak French market. However, Asian bookings jumped 13.9%. The burgeoning Chinese middle class is becoming more demanding and overseas visits have topped 83m, with spending of $102bn (\u00a367bn), overtaking Germany and the US to become the world&apos;s largest outbound tourism market, according to Chinese authorities. Chinese tourists tend to travel to Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau \u2013 where they can gamble legally \u2013 but have started to look further afield. According to Thailand&apos;s tourism authority, Chinese tourist numbers jumped 93% to 1.1 million in the first three months of 2013, and the country beat Hong Kong to the top spot for overseas visits for the first time. Chinese tourists are also particularly fond of French fashion brands including Dior, Louis Vuitton and Chanel, spending \u00a33,500 per trip, according to China Confidential. Club Med pioneered the all-inclusive holiday resort in the 1950s and 1960s, but has recently struggled amid the economic downturn in Europe. Jiannong Qian, of Fosun, said: &quot;I am convinced that with AXA Private Equity and the current management, we have the means to face short-term uncertainties to support the development of Club M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, in particular in Asia, and consolidate its positions in Europe.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/30/who-owns-rockall-legal-history-hancock", "publicationDate": "2013-05-30T14:19:07Z", "tags": ["Rockall", "Scotland", "UK news", "Law", "United Nations", "Ireland", "Iceland", "Denmark", "Europe", "World news"], "sentences": ["Another group of islands in the South China Sea that generates nationalist fervour is the Paracel archipelago where China, Taiwan and Vietnam vie for control."], "title": "Who owns Rockall? A history of legal and diplomatic wrangles", "article": "Who owns Rockall? The isolated Atlantic outcrop has generated fierce nationalist rivalries since the first Royal Navy expedition scrambled ashore in 1810. Key Foreign Office files on its legal status dating back to the early 1970s remain closed to researchers for up to 50 years on the grounds of &quot;prejudice to international relations&quot; \u2013 a clear sign of the sensitivities still swirling about. Possession of Rockall, 240 miles (386km) west of the Scottish mainland, was for many decades deemed imperative in order to generate claims to the vast tracts of surrounding fisheries and the oil-rich Atlantic seabed. The Royal Navy annexed the rock in 1955 by hoisting the union flag and cementing a brass plaque on its storm-washed summit. The 1972 Island of Rockall Act, passed by parliament, formally declared it to be part of Inverness-shire, even though the nearest permanently inhabited settlement is 228 miles away on North Uist in the Outer Hebrides. British imperial ambitions were set back, however, by international ratification of the UN convention on the law of the sea (Unclos) in 1982, which states: &quot;Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.&quot; That decision meant ownership of Rockall, which is the eroded rump of an extinct volcano, would no longer be decisive in the international, diplomatic battle for control of the seabed below. The rules of Unclos stipulate that coastal states can register claims to the seabed up to 350 nautical miles offshore. Claims are ratified by the UN commission on the limits of the continental shelf which sits in New York. The UK made its formal submission for the Hatton/Rockall area in 2009, using the deserted island of St Kilda, inhabited until 1930, as its baseline. Rockall is 167 nautical miles to the west of St Kilda. The UK, however, is not the only state eager to gain control of the Hatton/Rockall basin. Ireland, Iceland and Denmark (on behalf of the Faroes) have also lodged overlapping claims. Consequently, there have been quadripartite talks shuffling between London, Dublin, Reykjavik and Copenhagen for years in an attempt to agree common underwater borders that would allow exploration to start. Despite the tortuous negotiations, Rockall retains a symbolic attraction for adventurers. Tom McClean, an SAS veteran, endured 40 days roped to the outcrop in 1985 in order to assert the UK&apos;s claim. In 1997, Greenpeace protesters lasted for 42 days as part of a protest against oil exploration. If the Rockall adventurer Nick Hancock survives for 60 days would that prove that Rockall, despite everything that has been agreed by UN officials and British diplomats, is capable of sustaining human habitation? Underwater reserves of oil, gas and minerals are increasingly being eyed by rival nations eager to boost their reserves. Rockall is not the only island at the centre of an international, political dispute. The Spratly Islands in the South China Sea are the focus of rival claims involving China, the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. Another group of islands in the South China Sea that generates nationalist fervour is the Paracel archipelago where China, Taiwan and Vietnam vie for control. As for Rockall, it has the distinction of having inspired a rousing republican anthem, Rock on Rockall, by the Irish group the Wolfe Tones. The chorus goes: &quot;Oh rock on Rockall, you&apos;ll never fall to Britain&apos;s greedy hands/Or you&apos;ll meet the same resistance that you did in many lands/May the seagulls rise and pluck your eyes and the water crush your shell/And the natural gas will burn your ass and blow you all to hell.&quot; A Foreign Office spokesperson said: &quot;The UK has agreed maritime boundaries with the Irish to the south and Denmark, on behalf of the Faroe Islands, to the north. &quot;Informal negotiations between the four parties as to how to delimit the area subject to counter-claims have been ongoing for some years.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/30/google-moto-x-motorola-smartphone", "publicationDate": "2013-05-30T20:08:00Z", "tags": ["Google", "Technology", "Mobile phones", "Telecoms", "Smartphones", "Apple", "iPhone", "Telecommunications industry", "Business", "US news", "Motorola"], "sentences": ["Most of its components, however, will still come from abroad, including processors from Taiwan and screens from South Korea."], "title": "Google to unveil Moto X as it takes smartphone battle to Apple", "article": "Google has turned its guns on Apple by revealing plans for low-cost, futuristic smartphones, assembled not in south-east Asia but by 2,000 workers at a plant in Texas. The factory in Fort Worth that 15 years ago built Nokia handsets is to start work this summer on what Google claims will be the only smartphones made in the US. The fruits of two years of work, since the company&apos;s purchase of Motorola in 2011, will go on display this autumn, when it launches an entirely new range of handsets led by a flagship device named the Moto X. It is claimed the phones will be able to predict what their owner wants to do next. The devices will be packed with sensors that can detect whether they are sitting idle in a pocket or in use on a car dashboard, and change their behaviour accordingly. While Apple&apos;s critics say the once wildly inventive company is running out of ideas, Motorola&apos;s chief executive, Dennis Woodside, has promised to bring &quot;audaciousness&quot; and &quot;innovation&quot; back to mobile computing. In a future-gazing presentation at the AllThingsD conference in California, Woodside, who has been charged with turning around the company that invented the first mobile phones of the 1980s, said he was also working on wearable technology. Motorola executive Regina Dugan, a former director of advanced projects for the US military who has been described as an &quot;impresario of mad science&quot;, showed off an electronic &quot;tattoo&quot; and a pill which contains a transmitter whose battery is powered by stomach acid, both of which can be used to send signals that replace passwords for unlocking devices. &quot;That becomes my first superpower,&quot; Dugan said. &quot;My arms are like wires; my hands are like alligator clips; when I touch my phone, my computer, my door, my car, I&apos;m authenticated in.&quot; The pill, made by a company called Proteus, changes the swallower&apos;s whole body into a password. It has already been approved for medical uses and put on trial in Motorola&apos;s labs. In the immediate future, Google has set its sights on the 50% profit margins enjoyed by Apple and Samsung on their top-of-the-range products. The iPhone&apos;s price tag has not come down since the first version appeared in 2007. &quot;One of the areas that we think is really open for Motorola is building high-quality, low-cost devices,&quot; Woodside said. &quot;The price of a feature phone now is about $30 [\u00a320] on a global basis. The price of a smartphone is about $650. That is not going to persist.&quot; Motorola&apos;s decision to make phones in the US sets it apart from Apple, which has relied heavily on assembly plants run by Foxconn in China, where it was compelled to step in to improve labour conditions after worker suicides. Recruitment will begin in August for Motorola&apos;s plant, which employed as many as 6,000 workers under Nokia. Although labour costs are higher in its home market, Motorola could benefit from having a factory on its doorstep. &quot;When your manufacturing is thousands of miles away from your engineers and your designers, you lose the ability to innovate, you lose the ability to make fast changes to how you&apos;re manufacturing things,&quot; Woodside said. &quot;There&apos;s a ton of technology that&apos;s coming in around 3D printing and much smaller-run manufacturing that we think we can take advantage of right here.&quot; Around 70% of the assembly of the parts in a typical Motorola phone will take place in Texas, and the company will source components including toughened &quot;gorilla glass&quot; from 12 US states. Most of its components, however, will still come from abroad, including processors from Taiwan and screens from South Korea. Woodside kept the Moto X phone he said he was carrying in his pocket hidden, but said the device would be able to perform tricks such as launching the camera app if it was removed from a pocket and held up to take a photograph. Low-power gyroscopes, which sense the angle at which a phone is being held, and accelerometers, which measure its movement, will help the phone guess what its user wants to do next. &quot;It&apos;s more contextually aware,&quot; Woodside said. &quot;Imagine when you&apos;re in the car. The device will know whether it&apos;s on or off, it&apos;s travelling at 60 miles an hour, it&apos;s going to act differently, so you can interact with it safely.&quot; Love bytes We wake up next to them in the morning and they keep us company throughout the day. Now a study has found the average British adult spends more time gazing at their smartphones than into their partner&apos;s eyes.

By far the most popular activity during the 119 minutes a day given over to the small screen is web browsing, which accounts for 24 minutes. We spend 16 minutes checking social networks, a quarter of an hour playing music, and the next most popular activities are playing games and making calls, followed by text messaging and emails. Smartphones are also muscling out everyday objects. More than half of the 2,000 surveyed for the annual Mobile Life study say their phone has now replaced their alarm clock.

In 2012 Bloom had &quot;produced and packaged&quot; a novella called Polar City Red, about climate refugees in a post-apocalyptic Alaska in the year 2075. Bloom labelled the book &quot;cli-fi&quot; in the press release and says he coined that term in 2007, cli-fi being short for &quot;climate fiction&quot;, described as a sub-genre of sci-fi. Polar City Red bombed, selling precisely 271 copies, until National Public Radio (NPR) and the Christian Science Monitor picked up on\u00a0the term cli-fi last month, writing Bloom out of\u00a0the story. So Bloom has blogged his reply on Teleread, saying he&apos;s simply pleased the term is now out there \u2013 it has gone viral since the NPR piece by Scott Simon. It&apos;s not quite as neat as that \u2013 in recent months the term has been used increasingly in\u00a0literary and environmental circles \u2013 but\u00a0there&apos;s no doubt it has broken out\u00a0more widely. You can search for cli-fi on Amazon, instantly bringing up\u00a0a plethora of books with titles such\u00a0as 2042: The Great Cataclysm, or\u00a0Welcome to the Greenhouse. Twitter has\u00a0been abuzz. Whereas 10 or 20 years ago it would have been difficult to identify even a handful of books that fell under this banner, there is now a growing corpus of novels setting out to warn readers of possible environmental nightmares to\u00a0come. Barbara Kingsolver&apos;s Flight Behaviour, the story of a forest valley filled with an apparent lake of fire, is shortlisted for the 2013 Women&apos;s prize for fiction. Meanwhile, there&apos;s Nathaniel Rich&apos;s Odds Against Tomorrow, set in a future New York, about a mathematician who deals in worst-case scenarios. In Liz Jensen&apos;s 2009 eco-thriller The Rapture, summer temperatures are asphyxiating and Armageddon is near; her most recent book, The Uninvited, features uncanny warnings from a desperate future. Perhaps the most high-profile cli-fi author is Margaret Atwood, whose 2009 The Year of the Flood features survivors of a biological catastrophe also central to her 2003 novel Oryx and\u00a0Crake, a book Atwood sometimes preferred to call &quot;speculative fiction&quot;. Engaging with this subject in fiction increases debate about the issue; finely constructed, intricate narratives help us broaden our understanding and explore imagined futures, encouraging us to think about the kind of world we want to live in. This can often seem difficult in our 24\u2011hour news-on-loop society where the consequences of climate change may appear to be everywhere, but intelligent discussion of it often seems to be nowhere. Also, as the crime genre can provide the dirty thrill of, say, reading about a gruesome fictional murder set on a street the reader recognises, the best cli-fi novels allow us to be briefly but intensely frightened: climate chaos is closer, more immediate, hovering over our shoulder like that murderer wielding his knife. Outside of the narrative of a\u00a0novel the issue can seem fractured, incoherent, even distant. As Gregory Norminton puts it in his introduction to an anthology on the subject, Beacons: Stories for Our Not-So-Distant Future: &quot;Global warming is a predicament, not a story. Narrative only comes in our response to that predicament.&quot; Which is as good an argument as any for engaging with those stories. All terms are reductive, all labels simplistic \u2013 clearly, the likes of Kingsolver, Jensen and Atwood have a\u00a0much broader canvas than this one issue. And there&apos;s an argument for saying this is simply rebranding: sci-fi writers have been engaging with the climate-change debate for longer than literary novelists \u2013 Snow by Adam Roberts comes to mind \u2013 and I do wonder whether this is a term designed for squeamish writers and critics who dislike the box labelled &quot;science fiction&quot;. So the term is certainly imperfect, but it&apos;s also valuable. Unlike sci-fi, cli-fi writing comes primarily from a place of warning rather than discovery. There are no spaceships hovering in the sky; no clocks striking 13. On the contrary, many of the horrors described seem oddly familiar. There is an opportunity here. Whenever a literary term gains traction it is a chance to examine not only what it says about the writers who explore the new ground but also the readers who buy it, read it, discuss it. And that discussion is only going to get louder. It is already difficult for any serious writer to imagine convincing worlds on\u00a0the page without admitting that these worlds, if they resemble our own, are under threat. As that threat grows, so will the vocabulary designed to make sense of it. \u2022 Please join the conversation \u2013 nominate your cli-fi novels below and tell us why you think they qualify"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/may/31/firefox-tablet-foxconn-mozilla", "publicationDate": "2013-05-31T11:44:36Z", "tags": ["Firefox", "Mozilla", "Foxconn", "Tablet computers"], "sentences": ["Mozilla is holding an event on 3 June with Taiwanese firm Hon Hai, the parent of manufacturing company Foxconn, to unveil a new device running Firefox OS, according to Reuters.", "News site Focus Taiwan has an &quot;industry insider&quot; source claiming it will be a tablet rather than a smartphone."], "title": "Firefox OS tablet from Foxconn tipped for 3 June unveiling", "article": "Mozilla made a splash at Mobile World Congress in February with the official launch of its Firefox OS for smartphones, with several manufacturers and 18 operators already on board.

Indeed, a Firefox tablet would go back to the roots of Firefox OS itself, as explained by Mozilla&apos;s vice president of mobile engineering Andreas Gal in an interview with ZDNet in February this year at MWC. &quot;When the project started, tablets were the initial goal that we thought about, a year and a half ago. Initially we were thinking about tablets as it&apos;s a mobile device but it&apos;s more similar to the desktop \u2014 a bigger screen, you can consume rich content better,&quot; he said then. &quot;It became clear very quickly that the volume right now is behind smartphones. Tablets are an interesting next step... I can definitely see us going to tablets in future, right now a lot of opportunities exist in phones, at least for this year.&quot; Based on the first clutch of Firefox OS smartphones shown at MWC, a Firefox OS tablet is certainly viable. Also, Mozilla would be off to a running start in terms of getting apps for such a tablet, for the same reasons outlined by its senior vice president of products Jay Sullivan in February. &quot;There is no new ecosystem,&quot; he told journalists at the MWC press launch. &quot;If you&apos;re building for the web today, and most developers are building beautiful touch-friendly mobile websites to work in modern browsers\u2026 If you are building that, you are building a Firefox OS app. You may just not know it yet.&quot; The big challenge for a Firefox OS tablet will be distribution \u2013\u00a0at least if it&apos;s to become more than just a niche product for Mozillaphiles. The tablet world is a ferociously competitive place in 2013, with 49.2m units shipped in the first quarter of 2013 according to IDC: 56.5% of them Android devices, 39.6% iPads and 3.7% running Windows or Windows RT. Stepping up against Apple, Google and Microsoft (not to mention the manufacturing partners of the latter two) in the hardware market is a very different kettle of fish to the market-share battles in the web browser space. Much of what Charles Arthur wrote about Firefox OS in February relates as much to tablets as it does to smartphones. That&apos;s true in smartphones, of course, where Mozilla is hoping its trump card will be strong operator partnerships \u2013\u00a018 were on board at the MWC launch, with a parade of telco CEOs appearing on-stage to praise Firefox OS at the event \u2013\u00a0and a focus on emerging markets rather than the big Western countries. Could such a strategy pay off for tablets too? A Firefox slate with cellular connectivity, subsidised by operators and making its debut in Latin America and Eastern Europe (the pattern for the first Firefox OS smartphones) would be an intriguing prospect indeed. Roll on 3 June, when we&apos;ll find out if that&apos;s on the cards."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/31/patrick-mercer-resignation-spotlight-lobbying", "publicationDate": "2013-05-31T17:57:38Z", "tags": ["Lobbying", "House of Commons", "Conservatives", "Politics", "UK news"], "sentences": ["Several groups are sponsored directly or indirectly by foreign governments, and in 2011-12, such deals facilitated trips to 27 countries, including China, Morocco, Azerbaijan, Taiwan, Thailand, Israel and Liechtenstein for members of 15 different groups."], "title": "Patrick Mercer resignation puts spotlight on lobbying", "article": "To those who do not know the intricacies of parliament and its arcane rules, the reasons for Patrick Mercer&apos;s resignation from the Conservative party, and pledge not to stand at the next election, will probably seem bizarre. Mercer was apparently approached by journalists posing as members of a lobbying company, who asked him to set up an all-party parliamentary group (APPG) relating to Fiji and its exclusion from the Commonwealth. APPGs are semi-official groups of MPs and lords, which can be started by any parliamentarian who can muster enough cross-party signatures from both houses. While many serve as focus points for hobbies or campaign causes of MPs, they serve a dual function as a notorious back door for lobbyists, who can use them to fund drinks parties, overseas trips and more for big businesses and governments. Yet all of the above is within the rules. The reason for Mercer&apos;s resignation, it seems, is not that he was willing to accept outside funding and start such a group, but that he failed to declare \u00a32,000 of the proffered \u00a34,000. APPGs have long been a subject of contention in the house. They require only limited declarations of outside interests, and often serve as social clubs: parliament&apos;s choir is established as a group, as is its rowing team. As a result, many serve as avenues for sponsorship to come into the house. The aforementioned choir, for example, received \u00a365,000 in sponsorship from BT, while the rowing team receives \u00a316,000 from Siemens towards the cost of parliament&apos;s boat race. Other groups get money from organisations even more closely tied to their interests: the APPG on beer, for example, exists to &quot;promote the wholesomeness and enjoyment of beer and the unique role of the pub in UK society&quot;, and in furtherance of that receives more than \u00a365,000 in total, with contributions from Diageo, Carlsberg, Punch Taverns, SABMiller and more. Parliamentarians can even enjoy free membership of WeightWatchers \u2013 declared as worth \u00a3235 a year \u2013 if they join the all-party parliamentary WeightWatchers group, to &quot;promote the long-term benefits to health of gradual weight loss&quot;. The associate parliamentary health group, meanwhile, takes \u00a38,400 apiece in &quot;membership fees&quot; from numerous pharmaceutical and healthcare giants, including Alliance Boots, Serco Health AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis. In all, there are now almost 600 such groups, representing countries, illnesses, industry and more \u2013 with some MPs enjoying membership of dozens at a time. Last year, the Guardian calculated more than \u00a31.8m in outside sponsorship came into parliament via such all-party groups. Provided any benefits are declared by the group \u2013 and, in the case of visits, by individual MPs too \u2013 this is entirely within parliamentary rules. APPGs are not mandated to publish any minutes of their meetings, or details of whom they meet, but are able to issue passes giving access to the parliamentary estate. Several groups are sponsored directly or indirectly by foreign governments, and in 2011-12, such deals facilitated trips to 27 countries, including China, Morocco, Azerbaijan, Taiwan, Thailand, Israel and Liechtenstein for members of 15 different groups. Last year, a working group established by the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, and the speaker of the House of Lords looked into &quot;whether APPGs should be required to publish minutes and accounts; and the funding of APPG activities&quot; \u2013 but to date have failed to take any concrete action. More than a year ago, the transparency activist Heather Brooke, the woman behind bringing the MPs&apos; expenses scandal to light, warned that all-party groups &quot;create the perception of lobbying through the back door&quot;. The renewed focus on this longstanding parliamentary back door as a result of Mercer&apos;s resignation \u2013 and if Westminster rumours are to be believed, forthcoming stings on other MPs and Lords based on similar approaches \u2013 may bring this relatively obscure practice to wider attention. What the public might make of it all, however, remains to be seen."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/01/this-weeks-new-film-events", "publicationDate": "2013-06-01T05:00:00Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Various venues, Sat to 8 Jun Terracotta Far East Film festival, London As a sampler for current trends in east Asian cinema, this festival is almost spoilt for choice; hence the 13 UK premieres from Hong Kong, Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, China and South Korea."], "title": "This week's new film events", "article": "The Fog, London As if a screening of a seminal horror movie in a spooky location wasn&apos;t enough, this event is also a format-junkie&apos;s wet-dream.

What you don&apos;t think of is girl gangs, go-go dancers and fetishistic hitmen.

In Denmark, online tracking of citizens is an unwieldy failure &gt;&gt; TechPresident  Half a decade after Denmark passed a law mandating that telecommunication companies retain and store their customers&apos; personal data for up to one year, local advocacy groups and the telecom industry are pushing for immediate changes to the legislation. The practice of keeping records of private citizens&apos; Internet use is an unjustifiable invasion of privacy, they say. The police, meanwhile, have concluded that requiring telecoms to store Internet subscriber data has not helped them track criminals, which was the the ostensible purpose of the practice. But the Danish government still wants to postpone an evaluation of the law for another two years... Session logging has caused serious practical problems,&quot; the ministry&apos;s staffers write in the report. &quot;The implementation of session logging proved to be unusable to the police; this became clear the first time they tried to use [the data] as part of a criminal investigation.&quot;   In the UK this proposal is being called the &quot;Snooper&apos;s Charter&quot;.

But once the HTC Desire was welcomed by global consumers and telecom operators at the time, Samsung &quot;strategically declined&quot; to supply its AMOLED displays to the smartphone maker, Tong said at a local forum on mobile broadband.  &quot;We found that key component supply can be used as a competitive weapon,&quot; he said.   Wonder what proportion of HTC components now come from Samsung. (Via Androidbeat.) As anti-government protests erupt in Istanbul, Facebook and Twitter appear suddenly throttled &gt;&gt; TechCrunch Mike Butcher:   A massive anti-government protest in Istanbul, prompted after days of unrest were sparked by plans to redevelop one of the last remaining central public parks, appears to have led to a throttling of social media both in the city and across Turkey. TechCrunch has independently verified via a number of sources that both Facebook and Twitter have been almost impossible to access from inside Istanbul, and other parts of Turkey. There are also anecdotal reports of authorities switching off access in a localised manner around Taksim Square where thousands of people are demonstrating.   Complaints of Twitter throttling (against hashtags) have been made for a long time against the Turkish government. This American Life: Intellectual Ventures got 90% of ongoing profits even after selling patent &gt;&gt; GeekWire  Intellectual Ventures struck a deal to receive 90% of the ongoing profits from a patent that it sold to a mysterious company called Oasis Research -- which then used the patent to sue 16 tech companies, reaching large settlements with many of them.  That&apos;s according to a follow-up piece airing this weekend on This American Life, the public radio program that first dug into Intellectual Ventures&apos; dealings as part of a larger exploration of the patent system in 2011. The size of that &quot;back-end&quot; cut is one of the revelations in the new piece.   The patent in question was used to in a lawsuit against 16 companies. Intellectual Ventures is the company run by ex-Microsoftie Nathan Myhrvold. There have long been suspicions that it&apos;s behind, and benefits from, lawsuits by small &quot;non-practising entities&quot; - aka patent trolls. This is the first time this has been confirmed. And when one targeted company finally took the case all the way to a jury trial, the patent was found invalid. But that didn&apos;t help companies which had already signed up to pay in earlier settlements.

Many of the most exciting advances in the field try to improve human incapacities with things such as memory, hearing, stamina or intellect. In my field of nanomedicine, the notion of human enhancement is, in a lot of cases, a way to deal with disease: enhancing vision, cognitive functions or improving a person&apos;s ability to move independently. I have always found the relationship between technology and its use to &quot;aid&quot; or &quot;enhance&quot; human capability intriguing because there is a fine line beyond which all kinds of ethical alarms go off. Where does human enhancement against true pathological conditions or disabilities end? Thoughts like these were on my mind last autumn on a plane to Taiwan, when I watched the latest movie version of one my favourite comic-book heros, Spider-man. The main character, a very normal, scientifically talented and altruistic teenager (who truly wants to save the world) is bitten by an experimental transgenic spider, which results in his transformation into a man-spider hybrid. This concept is a classic method used in science fiction to explain the creation of characters with super-human powers. Interestingly, the transformation almost always occurs after exposure to different agents perceived as &quot;dangerous&quot; \u2013 Spider-man with an unintended bite by a transgenic spider, the Hulk by intentional exposure to external beam radiation. Interactions with human-machine interfaces have also been exploited in science fiction numerous times with the most recent example that of Iron Man (or Robocop and Total Recall for those of a more distant era). These tales are not only entertaining, they also reveal many important aspects of our relationship with medicine, science and technology. It is now clear that &quot;human enhancement&quot; is a reality and not just a product of science fiction. Even more so, technological advances will imminently provide various devices that will interface with the human body in various ways. A recent article in Science magazine exemplified how machines can interact with living brains to allow wireless changes in behaviour by the implantation of devices directly into the brains of mice. These devices could then be remotely controlled to activate different parts of the brain using light. Two recent articles by fellow bloggers for CNN and the Guardian have described chips implanted in the brain to enhance memory and other implants to allow connectivity between brains. These are just a few cases of how technology can allow transcendence into a hybrid human-machine neuronal system of higher capabilities. People living with a wide range of disabilities will benefit immensely from these advances. But what is the ethical, legal and social framework that will result from the wide adoption of these technologies? New devices will shrink with the use of nanomaterials to allow implantation or grafting by a simple injection or tattooing. The first generation of such devices are expected to act as health monitors (temperature, blood pressure, glucose levels, etc) able to connect wirelessly with the patients&apos; smartphones and their doctors&apos; computers. The next generation will be more sophisticated, more capable and more functional, something like hi-tech hearing aids, vision aids or even memory aids. Would that constitute &quot;doping&quot; at a massive scale? Would people who will have brain implants to enhance their vision or intellectual capacities be treated differently to those of us who may choose to remain implant-free? How strict and how realistic would it be to regulate such procedures? Maybe I&apos;m worrying too much and society at large will be less squeamish. But I have distant childhood memories (back in the 1970s, if you&apos;re asking) of how rare plastic surgery procedures were almost exclusively confined to patients in need. I recently came across statistics as to the popularity of modern plastic and cosmetic surgery procedures around the world to note that breast, lip and buttock implants are now collectively termed &quot;soft tissue enhancements&quot;. These non-medically driven &quot;enhancements&quot; constitute the majority of procedures undertaken. There are millions of them performed and they are on the rise. More disconcerting to me is the thought that our brain may one day fall into the category of &quot;soft tissue&quot; as well. Clearly, we need to allow disabled people and the various patient groups to benefit from advancements in electronics, informatics and nanotechnology. And I must stress that in no way do I advocate that a possible solution could involve restrictions on generation of new knowledge and technological advancement. Research work should (and will) not be affected by the possibility of misuse or exaggeration by certain individuals or organisations. The challenge will be to draw a visible line that could be regulated and could not be crossed globally, restricting &quot;human enhancement&quot; to only those who medically need it, irrespective of their financial or celebrity stature. I am not sure though whether such regulatory framework and its enforcement could be feasible at a global scale, given the levels of competitiveness and range of ethical principles that prevail. Alternatively, shall we just accept the fact that we will learn to live with fellow humans who will be &quot;enhanced&quot; either by selection from their governments, armies, companies or by personal choice into spider-climbing individuals with hugely projected breasts, lips, buttocks and Einstein-brains? \u00a0 \u2022 Kostas Kostarelos is a professor of nanomedicine at University College London and director of the university&apos;s Nanomedicine Lab"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/05/catwalk-absurd-no-frivolous-matter", "publicationDate": "2013-06-05T17:30:01Z", "tags": ["Fashion industry", "British Fashion Council", "Fashion", "Mary Portas", "Life and style"], "sentences": ["This week&apos;s Graduate Fashion Week alone will bring together more than 1,000 BA graduates from 40 UK establishments, in addition to collections from 16 universities around the world, including New York&apos;s Parsons and Fashion Institute of Technology, plus colleges from Turkey, Pakistan, Israel, Taiwan and the major European countries."], "title": "The catwalk might be absurd, but fashion is no frivolous matter | Hannah Betts", "article": "This is Graduate Fashion Week, giving us our pick of shrouds, wimples, gimp masks, cloven shoes, S&amp;M lederhosen, three-legged trews, sheer burqas, male mouth merkins, broken china bodices and lumpen pocketing.

Oh, how our pretension cup runneth over. But Ab Fab platitudes aside, fashion is no mere frippery. As an industry, it receives virtually no help from government, beyond the odd, SamCam-starring, No 10 shindig, yet is worth billions. Specifically, \u00a321bn according to The Value of the UK Fashion Industry, a report commissioned by the British Fashion Council in 2010 that attempted to quantify the economic and social impact of this most elegant industry for the first time. &quot;Frivolous&quot; fashion is the nation&apos;s second biggest employer, and the largest employer of all the creative industries, directly responsible for 816,000 jobs. Its business is similar in scale to food and drink, generating more than twice as many jobs as real estate, and considerably more than car manufacturing, telecommunications and publishing put together. Moreover, it boasts obvious knock-on effects for tourism and financial services. Non-aficionados who have endured some of the less impressive shows know them to boast all the tedium and self-importance of a school play. However, as a whole, London Fashion Week is justly recognised as the most innovative and creative of fashion&apos;s four major weeks, and the place where new careers tend to take flight (even if this is a euphemism for &quot;people leave to make money&quot;). According to the most recent figures, it is estimated to have a tourism impact of \u00a398m, making \u00a320m a year for the capital and drawing in orders of \u00a3100m. High fashion alone is worth \u00a3450m per annum. There are not many areas in which Britain can claim to lead the world, but fashion is one of them. Students compete from all over the globe to become alumni of Central Saint Martins, the Royal College of Art and London College of Fashion. As countries become more moneyed, so they strive to be more exquisitely clad, meaning that Britain has the eye of Russia, China, India and Brazil for sartorial and investment purposes. This week&apos;s Graduate Fashion Week alone will bring together more than 1,000 BA graduates from 40 UK establishments, in addition to collections from 16 universities around the world, including New York&apos;s Parsons and Fashion Institute of Technology, plus colleges from Turkey, Pakistan, Israel, Taiwan and the major European countries. And, in an age where the number of unemployed 16- to 24-year-olds sits at a million, many will be flocking to its job zone, where business skills can be honed to match creativity. Sartorially speaking, the French may be stereotyped as chic conservatives, Italians witty sensualists and the Yanks sporting. We, meanwhile, have style, street up and catwalk down. From Beau Brummell giving the world the suit, to today&apos;s poster dandy Prince Charles with his double-breasted backing of the wool trade, Britain&apos;s men and women have cut a dash. Whether prim or punk, pretty in pink or stalwart in green, white and violet, Mary Barton&apos;s millworkers or Mary Portas&apos;s pants, it is we who have given substance to style. Particular to the British character would appear to be a collective determination that freedom of expression rules, boundaries being there to be broken. We combine consummate craftsmanship (textiles and tailoring) with a sense both of the sublime and the ridiculous, frequently achieved simultaneously. As totalitarian regimes teach us, freedom to dress is no small indication of wider liberties. Britain&apos;s status as the mother of democracy allows it to be the great mothf*cker of fashion. Our clothing conveys messages beyond mere adornment: is political as it is decorative. Witness the elaborate sumptuary laws dictating Tudor court costume currently on display at Buckingham Palace. Charles II&apos;s decision to avoid ostentatious dress following the interregnum was intensified by the material losses and anti-French feeling in the wake of the Great Fire of London; restraint that forced Pepys and Co into the waistcoat. Fashion is not, then, something either to castigate female politicians for or be eschewed by the male. It is not only size 0 debates, or Dove campaign anxieties. For, amid this week&apos;s spats and spangles, hessian and herringbone, something brilliantly British will be taking shape."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2013/jun/10/penny-farthings-making-comeback", "publicationDate": "2013-06-10T10:13:18Z", "tags": ["Cycling", "Fitness", "Life and style", "Cycling", "Sport"], "sentences": ["Rideable Bicycle Replicas of the US is a retailer of what it calls &quot;hiwheels&quot; and it&apos;s even possible to order a penny replica from Taiwan, the &quot;bicycle island&quot; where most high-end modern bikes are made."], "title": "Riding high as penny farthings make a comeback | Carlton Reid", "article": "     Using eye-tracking technology to monitor driver behaviour, a recent study for an insurance company found that drivers failed to notice 22% of cyclists on the road.

And by high wheelers I don&apos;t mean 29ers \u2013 the wheel size that has taken over in the world of mountain biking \u2013 I mean real high wheelers: 48-inch diameter wheels for titches like me, 60in diameter wheels for the tallest of riders. Motorists tend to notice penny farthings. You could get up close to such bikes last Saturday night. Twenty-five or so penny farthing racers careered around the Smithfield Nocturne, a closed-road criterium in central London. The penny race was one of the warm-ups to the main event, a mass start race by some of the country&apos;s top riders on carbon road bikes; there was also a folding bike race. The penny race wasn&apos;t be a tweedy parade. Most of the riders were in Lycra \u2013 those who wear trad gear are not racing for glory \u2013 and the riding was fast and furious. When high-wheel bicycles are seen at fetes or in the media, it&apos;s 10 to a penny (farthing) that the gents riding them will be prim, proper and of relatively advanced age. Top hat. Waistcoat. Long jacket and cravat. Waxed &apos;tache. Respectable. Slow. Staid. This Victoriana visual is a cliche. High-wheelers back in the day were not slow, they were the fastest things on the bad roads of the day, not something that endeared them to rural folk, unused to through traffic and suspicious of strangers, speedy or otherwise. Direct drive bicycles of circa 1877 through to the early 1890s had developed bigger and bigger front wheels not for comfort on these rutted roads but to make the bicycle go faster. This was before the development of bicycle chains, and chain wheels and cog sizes of different sizes. Penny farthings were hard to ride, dangerous, expensive, and technologically advanced. They appealed to wealthy young men with time on their hands and who craved the speed and excitement of such machines. A penny was the red Ferrari of the age. When same wheel-size, newfangled safeties came along, from 1885, high-wheel bicycles became known as ordinaries, as they were the ordinary, standard bicycles of the time. High-wheelers were also given the coinage-based term of disparagement. Modern collectors of these machines used to be sniffy about the term penny farthing, but only the strictest will pull you up over use of the term. In fact, most collectors, when talking about ordinaries en masse, tend to call them &quot;pennies&quot; and the recent Pennies in the Park in Yorkshire didn&apos;t get shunned by purists. This was a family event that included an attempt to break the world record for the most high-wheelers stacked up against each at once. The attempt failed, but the organisers plan to run the event annually so will keep on trying for the record, especially as more riders are arriving on the scene. Penny farthings are making a comeback, and not just for reasons of caffeinated nostalgia. In 2012, Graham Eccles started an in-town postal service in Bude, Cornwall, using a modern penny farthing variant, and an IT specialist from Hull made his own penny farthing out of washing machine parts. Pennies can be practical machines, perfect for clocking great views over hedges and into HGV cabs, for instance. Historic machines sell for \u00a35,000 upwards, but you can combine a love for artisan-crafted bicycles with the desire for a modern high-wheeler because there are a number of penny farthing makers around the world, making machines to order. Josef Mesicek of the Czech Republic can produce a penny for you in classic black but there are also 88 other colours to choose from, including shocking pink. Rideable Bicycle Replicas of the US is a retailer of what it calls &quot;hiwheels&quot; and it&apos;s even possible to order a penny replica from Taiwan, the &quot;bicycle island&quot; where most high-end modern bikes are made. But if you want to buy a penny from somebody who&apos;s been there, done that, you really can&apos;t beat splashing your cash with former F1 race-engine mechanic Joff Summerfield of London. For \u00a31,500 you could have a Mk 5 Summerfield. The earlier models were made for Summerfield&apos;s solo penny farthing trip around the world. He left these shores in 2006: &quot;I ended up being away for two and a half years,&quot; he said. Summerfield, a manufacturer of hanging basket brackets and who made 10 pennies last year, was following in the &quot;globe girdler&quot; wheel tracks of Thomas Stevens, a Brit who lived most of his life in America and who was the first person to cycle around the world. Stevens did this on a 50-inch penny farthing between 1884 and 1886. &quot;[Stevens] is buried in North Finchley and I started my journey at his grave,&quot; said Summerfield. &quot;I took a stone with me and returned it when I got back, so he&apos;s been round twice now.&quot; Penny farthings are the original fixies, you can&apos;t easily stop pedalling. Once you know this, the video of Summerfield descending into Death Valley becomes extra scary: Summerfield was among those riding the Smithfield Nocturne penny race and there were three other racers on Summerfield machines. The maker rode a 27lb racing special, built light for even more speed. A video of the 2011 event shows that penny riders are no slouches. William Gladstone, prime minister in 1892, was a fan. He said: &quot;I have noticed with real and unfeigned pleasure the rapid growth of cycling in this country.&quot; He probably never rode a penny but that didn&apos;t stop Punch from picturing him on one. Whether prime ministers rode them or not, pennies were famously fast and allowed for great, elevated views; a bit like flying. And this was a major part of the appeal back in the 1870s and 1880s, as demonstrated by a poem by an English clergyman, Henry Charles Beeching: With lifted feet, hands still, I am poised, and down the hill Dart, with heedful mind The air goes by in a wind. Swifter and yet more swift, Till the heart with a mighty lift Makes the lungs laugh, the throat cry:- &apos;Oh bird, see; see, bird, I fly! &apos;Is this, is this your joy? O bird, then I, though a boy, For a golden moment share your feathery life in the air!&apos;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2013/jun/10/wales-guggenheim-museum-adam-price", "publicationDate": "2013-06-10T11:49:00Z", "tags": ["Culture professionals network", "Audiences", "Policy", "Logistics", "Professional development", "Art", "Art and design", "Museums", "Culture", "Wales", "UK news"], "sentences": ["In the last decade or so new Guggenheims have been mooted in Tokyo, in Taiwan&apos;s Taichung, in Rio de Janeiro, Guadalajara and in Vilnius."], "title": "Why a Welsh Guggenheim makes sense", "article": "It&apos;s 16 years since the world&apos;s leading art brand transformed the image of Bilbao from rusting industrial city to a cultural mecca, creating a thriving tourist industry virtually from scratch. So successful was the experiment it spawned an entire new phrase in culture-fuelled regeneration: the Guggenheim effect. There has certainly been no shortage of cities queuing up to repeat Bilbao&apos;s success ever since. In the last decade or so new Guggenheims have been mooted in Tokyo, in Taiwan&apos;s Taichung, in Rio de Janeiro, Guadalajara and in Vilnius. A Gehry-spawned addition to the network is currently being built on an artificial island off the coast of Abu Dhabi (next to a new branch of the Louvre \u2013 in the Gulf nothing is ever done by half measures). Back in Europe, however, the glittering prize of a new starchitect-designed Guggenheim was won by Helsinki. Or so it seemed, until city council members decided to bin the proposal despite a $2.5m feasibility study giving its glossy stamp of approval. Finnish frugality played a part. So did a debate about the role of a global brand in a nation with a self-made reputation in art and design. It was a form of inward cultural investment that many Finns, including the culture minister, felt they could do without. Was Finland&apos;s loss another&apos;s opportunity? When proposals for a Welsh Guggenheim surfaced last month, it seemed so. Wales is, in many ways, a late nation playing catch-up on a multitude of fronts, especially in the visual arts. Until recently, we were one of the few countries in the world to lack a national gallery, an omission that is at long last being rectified through the National Museum of Wales, under the capable leadership of David Anderson. But a major contemporary art gallery is still a missing piece in the national jigsaw. Could our visual arts sector emulate our recent sporting success, catapulting us into the art world&apos;s premier league? Welsh art certainly offers up an inviting narrative: the Davies Sisters&apos; collection of French impressionism and post-impressionism masterpieces is an early echo of the Guggenheims&apos; own philanthropy, also built through mine-owning riches. Our cultural conception of art, displayed in the Arts Council of Wales&apos; art and society exhibitions of the 1970s also mirrors the non-elitist approach of Guggenheim in its record-breaking Art of the Motorcycle exhibition two decades later. We have in Artes Mundi a truly global art prize and in Lumen, the world&apos;s pre-eminent digital art competition. What Guggenheim could offer Wales, as demonstrated by the Basques, is the chance to transform our image internationally. Set alongside other infrastructure investments \u2013 airport upgrading, electrification of the railway, an international convention centre and a Valleys metro \u2013 the project would signal our transition from manual past to creative future. Public response to the idea has been in contrast to the lukewarm reception among ordinary Finns. Keen discussion off and online has focused not on the whys and wherefores of a Welsh Guggenheim, but on which part of Wales would be the most fitting location. Cardiff, like three of Guggenheim&apos;s previous suitors in the 1990s, was already the intended site of a Zaha Hadid building \u2013 in our case, an opera house that would have been her first actual commission but sadly was never built. This would be a wonderful opportunity for redemption, perhaps on the site of the current Brains Brewery on the banks of the river Taff, due to be vacated in 2017. An equally good case could be made for Swansea, home to one of the UK&apos;s oldest art schools. But what of the world&apos;s first rural Guggenheim? The Bilbao Guggenheim developed advanced plans, now shelved, for a new facility in the Urdaibai nature reserve some 40km from the city. &apos;Gubai&apos; was intended to be a cultural innovation based not so much on an iconic building but an iconic landscape, with an artists-in-residency creativity lab and a space to explore the relationship between art, architecture and ecology \u2013 think the Tate St Ives and Eden Project in one. Pembrokeshire, which has long been a haven for artists \u2013 from the Welsh siblings Gwen and Augustus John through to English exiles like Graham Sutherland and John Piper \u2013 offers interesting possibilities in this direction, as does Snowdonia. If the idea has struck a chord in Wales, it has touched a nerve in New York. The Guggenheim Foundation was quick to quash speculation that a Welsh Guggenheim had any traction. The reasons became clear when it confirmed that they have engaged the Finnish PR firm Miltton in an attempt to revive the stalled Helsinki project. Paavo Arhinm\u00e4ki, Finnish culture minister and leader of the Left Alliance party that was instrumental in the alliance of Socialists and Greens that blocked the original proposal, continues to oppose it. However, Guggenheim&apos;s rejection of Wales may turn out to be the greatest gift imaginable. The end of our conversation with New York, at least for the time being, has created a space for a richer debate at home. In an age of Twitter-fuelled transparency and post-crisis economics, big bold ideas can no longer be developed in stealth. Public value-for-money dictates that the public must now be in on the ground floor of all our ideas. Perhaps this reflects a wider shift in the nature of museums themselves. From encyclopaedic &quot;cabinets of curiosity&quot;, to echoing cathedrals for the larger-scale work (and reputations) of artists, museums are now entering a third age as collaborative spaces, where artists, audiences and curators interact in the co-production of culture and value. Charlie Leadbeater has described this new wave of the avant garde as the &quot;art of with&quot;, echoing Alfred Barr, founding director of New York&apos;s other great gallery, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Barr&apos;s vision of the museum was a laboratory in whose experiments the public would be invited to participate. I am not sure that even MoMA has lived up to that revolutionary ambition. Wales, this little late nation, could yet surprise the world and build that future here.

In 2012, the UK made 1,268 requests to Skype for information such as the names of callers, their address, email account details and telephone numbers dialled. This was a quarter of all requests received by the Microsoft-owned internet call service from governments around the world. The requests could have come from British police and intelligence agencies, such as GCHQ. The US made 1,154 requests, while German and French intelligence agencies were among the top five heaviest users of backdoor access to Skype data, along with Taiwan. Germany made 686 requests and France made 402. Microsoft received more than 75,000 snooping orders in 2012, affecting 137,000 user accounts, according to its first law enforcement requests report, the publication of which in March was not widely reported. The UK was among the top three most active nations in requesting data from Microsoft, from products including Hotmail and Outlook email services, SkyDrive and Office 365 \u2013 which store files such as documents, videos and photos on Microsoft&apos;s servers and allow users to fetch files stored on their own computers from remote locations \u2013 and the Xbox Live service, which gamers often use to chat online. The UK made 9,226 requests on 14,301 Microsoft accounts, though not all of these are separate individuals, as some users have multiple Microsoft accounts. Only the US and Turkey made more requests, at just over 11,000 and 11,400 respectively. Skype became part of Prism, the internet intelligence system set up by America&apos;s National Security Agency, in February 2011, according to leaked documents obtained by the Guardian, just three months before Microsoft announced it intended to buy the video-calling company. Following the takeover by Microsoft in October 2011, Skype made big changes to simplify and centralise its network. &quot;Supernodes&quot;, which act as directories of Skype users and help route calls, were transferred from Skype&apos;s own data centres and storage rented from other companies including Amazon, on to Microsoft&apos;s data centres. Crucially, Skype also stopped its previous use of private computers as supernodes, according to security researcher Kostya Kortchinsky, and reduced the total nodes in use from 48,000 to 10,000. At the same time, Microsoft drew attention for filing a US patent application entitled &quot;legal intercept&quot;, which described a method of snooping on internet calls. Skype denied the changes were prompted by government pressure, saying the supernodes were not set up to monitor or record calls, and that all its calls were encrypted. But security experts, including Ravi Mandalia, raised concerns. &quot;Microsoft will be owning the keys used for encryption and thus these man-in-the-middle agents (servers) can be easily used to decrypt the data if need be,&quot; Mandalia wrote at the time. &quot;This effectively means that your Skype calls may not be secure anymore when it comes to eavesdropping and your privacy may be at risk.&quot; Microsoft is left to make its own decisions about which information requests to comply with. According to Microsoft&apos;s chief lawyer, general counsel Brad Smith, who wrote on the subject in March, information requests for the parent company are processed via the US and Ireland, while Skype takes requests from its headquarters in Luxembourg. Both companies said they required an official signed document compliant with local laws before releasing information. They are answerable to law enforcement agencies in the US, Ireland and Luxembourg. In the US, a subpoena is required before turning over non-content records, such as a subscriber&apos;s address, and a court order or warrant is required before producing content. However, when a user is thought likely to harm themselves or others, or if they are involved with indecent images of children, Microsoft can bypass these official channels by reporting what it describes as &quot;limited information about a user&quot; without a legal request. According to Skype, none of the information it has handed over so far has included the content of calls, although experts say the new network architecture could make content snooping easier. The UK received no content data from Microsoft directly. However, five requests from Ireland resulted in content being handed over. In the US, 14% of requests \u2013 1,544 \u2013 resulted in content being shared with intelligence agencies. But more than 7,000 British requests resulted in data being shared, including names, addresses and browsing history showing a list of websites visited by a Microsoft customer. Google&apos;s six-monthly transparency report, the next instalment of which is expected in July, shows the UK made 2,883 requests from the internet search group during 2012. According to the most recent figures, 70% of requests resulted in some form of data being shared with UK agencies."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jun/12/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2013-06-12T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "sentences": ["Excitement ebbing on WP8, say Taiwan makers &gt;&gt; Digitimes  International smartphone vendors other than Nokia have become less interested in adopting Microsoft Windows Phone 8 (WP8) platform mainly because WP8 has had a global smartphone market share of 3%, far short of the originally expected 10%, and Nokia has dominated the global market segment of WP8 smartphones by occupying over 70% of sales, according to Taiwan-based supply chain makers."], "title": "Boot up: more on iOS 7, Galaxy S4 card update, US hacking China, and more", "article": "A burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Is the new Apple iOS 7 look an improvement? &gt;&gt; Quora Do pitch in.

How OS X &quot;Mavericks&quot; works its power-saving magic &gt;&gt; Ars Technica Nate Anderson:   Timer Coalescing attempts to enforce some order on all this chaos. While on battery power, Mavericks will routinely scan all upcoming timers that apps have set and then apply a gentle nudge to line up any timers that will fire close to each other in time. This &quot;coalescing&quot; behavior means that the disk and CPU can awaken, perform timer-related tasks for multiple apps at once, and then return to sleep or idle for a longer period of time before the next round of timers fire. Apple has never guaranteed developers that timers will run at exact times, either, so this isn&apos;t necessarily a break with convention. Apple currently tells developers that &quot;because of the various input sources a typical run loop manages, the effective resolution of the time interval for a timer is limited to on the order of 50-100 milliseconds,&quot; and it notes that busy apps may have their timers affected even more.  Isn&apos;t that going to mess with music apps, which rely on timing precision that&apos;s more granular than that? (Thanks @rquick for the link.) Tim Cook is a great CEO &gt;&gt; stratechery Ben Thompson was once an intern (along with a few hundred others) at Apple:   Tim Cook, at least to my young, rather unjaded eyes, was Apple. He spoke to me \u2013 and to every person in the room \u2013 as if I were the only person in the world, and that he truly wanted me to understand what made Apple unique. Oh sure, the words were there \u2013 he spoke about Apple&apos;s focus, and willingness to say &quot;no,&quot; and about design \u2013 but it was the way in which he said it that made you believe. For me anyway, his reality distortion field was far more powerful than Jobs&apos;. It was obvious that Cook understood Apple, loved Apple, and was clearly the right man to make the decisions necessary to preserve Apple. Decisions like firing Scott Forstall. Forstall spoke to the interns as well. It was an incredibly impressive talk, and an incredibly disturbing one. Forstall was clearly the smartest person in the room; what was disturbing was that he obviously knew it, and wanted us all to know it as well.2 When the news broke about his firing, I was totally shocked, yet totally unsurprised.

Hidden away inside the massive NSA headquarters complex at Fort Meade, Maryland, in a large suite of offices segregated from the rest of the agency, TAO is a mystery to many NSA employees.  iOS 7: Apple&apos;s war against jailbreaking now makes perfect sense &gt;&gt; ZDNet Adrian Kingsley-Hughes:   Today at the WWDC 2013 keynote speech, Apple unveiled a new iOS 7 feature designed to combat iPhone theft, and suddenly Apple has a good reason to battle against jailbreaking. The new feature is called Activation Lock, and what this does is prevent a thief from bypassing the iPhone&apos;s Find My iPhone and lockscreen passcode by wiping the handset. Even after being wiped, the handset needs the owner&apos;s Apple ID in order to be used again \u2026While I&apos;ve been a fan of users having the ability to jailbreak their devices \u2013 devices that they after all have paid for and own \u2013 Apple&apos;s announcement of Activation Lock has caused me to change my stance.  Apple&apos;s dislike of jailbreaking also stems from the fact that doing so means exploiting security holes. Activation Lock might encrypt the device (it&apos;s not clear yet) so jailbreaking might not solve it anyway. Designers Complaining &gt;&gt; Tumblr What&apos;s that you say?

She began to fear that her previously soaring tennis career might be at risk. Watson had become the first British woman to win a WTA tour event in 24 years when, last October, she performed heroically in an arduous final at the Japan Open. She continued her rise up the world rankings and broke into the top 40. Yet in early April, after months of mysterious exhaustion and the threat of a complete burnout, Watson was diagnosed with glandular fever. Even though she was said to be in the last stages of an illness which had remained undetected in her system since last year, Watson knew that other prominent players had failed to recover. Robin Soderling, the 28-year-old Swede who has twice been a French Open finalist and the only man to have beaten Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros, has virtually disappeared from the game after a two-year struggle with glandular fever. The same ailment forced Mario Ancic, a former world No7, to retire at 26. Watson sets aside her anticipation about playing at Wimbledon next week by remembering how she was beset with anxiety about her future. &quot;It was worrying because I&apos;d heard all these stories about Soderling and Ancic. It finished their careers. I was also worried because you just don&apos;t know when it&apos;s going to get better and there are no guarantees. It could last months and months. &quot;I went home [to Guernsey] for two months and, actually, that&apos;s when I had really bad symptoms. I had a really bad fever and a very sore throat for weeks, like I had tonsillitis. I had no energy whatsoever. I was sleeping 14 hours a day and just waking up and watching TV \u2013 and even that was tough.&quot; Now, four matches into her comeback, the 21-year-old is tentatively optimistic. &quot;It&apos;s all good. I feel a lot better than I did but the doctors have said it can stay in my system for years.&quot; She appears certain why so many tennis players, including Roger Federer and Justine Henin, have been stricken with the illness. &quot;It&apos;s down to the gruelling schedule. People who just follow tennis superficially only see the big tournaments, the grand slams and events at Miami and Indian Wells. They don&apos;t see that we&apos;re literally playing every single week of the season. We get six weeks at the end of the year but we&apos;re using that time to work even harder to get ready for the new season. So it&apos;s tough and that&apos;s why a lot of players get glandular fever \u2013 because they feel so depleted.&quot; Watson felt so drained and confused that in Miami, just before the diagnosis, she announced that she needed a complete break from tennis. &quot;That was my lowest point because I&apos;d been feeling so tired every day and I had no idea why. I&apos;d got to the point of exhaustion where I said silly things to the media. So it was a huge relief when I was told I had glandular fever and that, looking back, it had started in November and December. I&apos;d played through it for months. I just said: &apos;Thank God \u2013 there&apos;s a reason. I&apos;m not just being pathetic.&apos;&quot; Is there anything Watson can do to alleviate the probability that remnants of the fever lurk inside her? &quot;I&apos;m looking after my diet even more carefully. I always used to basically eat what I wanted. I ate healthily \u2013 with plenty of vegetables \u2013 but I had my share of chocolate and crisps. Since coming back from the illness, I&apos;ve been really good. I&apos;ve only had one chocolate mousse and that was just because it was my best friend&apos;s birthday. I feel healthier and better about myself.&quot; At St Mary Magdalene school in Paddington, where she spends the afternoon playing mini-tennis and answering questions from small children, Watson looks happy and healthy. She engages naturally with the kids in her role as an ambassador for Statoil, the energy company which promotes young talent and funds the grassroots charity Give It Your Max by paying for qualified coaches to teach tennis in state schools. Yet, at the start of the year, she struggled through her undetected sickness to win two long and testing matches at the Australian Open. &quot;It was very tough. I was cramping after four games and at times I could hardly walk. It was a little scary. Eventually I had to tee off [aim for outright winners] and that worked and I ended up making the third round.&quot; Watson was driven to play on because last year had marked a turning point when she won her first tour title \u2013 beating Taiwan&apos;s Chang Kai-chen in a tumultuous final in Osaka. It was a tournament she&apos;d considered missing because, &quot;I cannot really explain how sore and tired my body was and how much I wanted to get home. But I thought I have to get as close as I can to the goal I&apos;d set at the start of 2012 \u2013 which was to make the top 50. Slowly I got there, wining round after round, and finally I was in the final. &quot;I had a match point in the second set and somebody yelled: &apos;Don&apos;t double-fault, Heather!&apos; I thought: &apos;Ah, I won&apos;t do that.&apos; I missed my first serve but I thought: &apos;It&apos;s match point and you want to win this.&apos; So I went for my second serve. It was a double-fault. The joker in the crowd was escorted away by the police because he&apos;d been shouting all through the match. &quot;I still lost that set and I was then three match points down in the third and she was serving at 40-0. I was thinking of the tears I was going to shed in the dressing room but I toughed it out. It was an incredible match and we both played really well. I was so happy. It really bolstered my belief \u2013 even if I was actually mad with myself that I hadn&apos;t won a WTA event before then. I&apos;m still mad that I haven&apos;t won a second.&quot; Watson grins and conjures up an even sweeter memory. &quot;Novak Djokovic came up to me at the Statoil Masters and said: &apos;Congratulations, Heather, on your first WTA title.&apos; I said &apos;Thank you!&apos; He said: &apos;It was in Osaka, right?&apos; I was very happy he knew but, later, I asked my agent: &apos;Did you tell him?&apos; She said no. I asked a few other people and they all said no. So it was awesome that he knew about me.&quot; Unlike Djokovic, who will be aiming for a seventh grand slam title, and second at Wimbledon, Watson will approach the grass courts of SW19 with relief simply that she is playing again. She made her comeback at the French Open and lost narrowly to Stefanie V\u00f6gele in the first round. &quot;I got lots of positive feedback,&quot; Watson says. &quot;My opponent played really well and almost made the fourth round. But I was still a little heartbroken. I wanted to win my comeback match.&quot; After Watson had swept through the second set 6-2, V\u00f6gele disappeared for a conveniently long toilet break which disrupted the British No2&apos;s rediscovered rhythm. &quot;Maybe she really needed to go,&quot; Watson shrugs. &quot;Maybe. But, still, I shouldn&apos;t have lost the first set \u2026&quot; The harsh competitiveness of tennis meant that it took her years before, in 2012, she finally won a singles match at Wimbledon. &quot;I&apos;d gone through two Junior Wimbledons, and two senior tournaments, and never won a singles match. I worked so hard every year in the build-up because I love Wimbledon and want to do well. And I lost in the first round every time. The nerves got me and I put too much pressure on myself. It meant so much to reach the third round last year.&quot; After her first two singles victories Watson faced the No3 seed \u2013 Agnieszka Radwanska. The artful Pole, who plays more subtle tennis compared to the usual power-hitters, handed Watson a humiliating loss \u2013 6-0, 6-2. &quot;I played terribly,&quot; Watson grimaces. &quot;I didn&apos;t know how to deal with her. I was just going for broke and it was so stupid. It was on Centre Court and I was so embarrassed I walked off afterwards and cried my eyes out. I didn&apos;t want to see anyone or be with anyone.&quot; Radwanska made the Wimbledon final last year but Watson only found consolation when she played her again in the third round of the Australian Open. She might have been in the unknown grip of glandular fever, and defeated 6-3, 6-1 but, as Watson says: &quot;The scoreline didn&apos;t do justice to the way I played. Those were two long sets and I was so much better than at Wimbledon.&quot; Reaching the third round in Australia meant that Watson cracked the top 40 for the first time and it followed her decision to ask her mother, Michelle, to step down as her main support partner on tour. Was it a case that Watson just wanted her old mum back? &quot;Oh, for sure. Being with someone day in, day out, and trying to be your support and your mum and trying to coach you as well, became too much. It just clashed \u2013 in our family anyway. It wasn&apos;t a tough choice for me. It was tougher for her.&quot; Presumably her mother recognises the logic of her decision? &quot;I hope so,&quot; Watson says with a little laugh. Her father, Ian, is instrumental in helping Watson set herself tough annual goals. She achieved her target in 2012, and entered the top 50, and this year, &quot;the plan was for me to be seeded for the French and in the top 30 by the end of the season. I wasn&apos;t too far off it until I got ill. But I&apos;ll reassess my year-end target after this grass-court season is over.&quot; Watson won her first match since returning at Edgbaston last week, beating Melinda Czink, before losing in straight sets to the unheralded Alla Kudryavtseva. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to gauge how I&apos;m going to play at Wimbledon,&quot; she admits. &quot;But in practice I&apos;m playing well.&quot; On Monday her recovery continued as, in the first round at Eastbourne, she defeated the world No27, Varvara Lepchenko, 6-3, 6-4. Watson, currently ranked 57, and Laura Robson, 37 in the world despite a change of coach and a bumpy run of late, will receive vociferous support at Wimbledon. The two friends, who have done so much to restore the tattered reputation of British women&apos;s tennis, can both improve. Watson, a smooth mover and determined fighter, needs to add greater firepower to her game \u2013 while Robson&apos;s big-hitting prowess would be bolstered by enhanced mobility and consistency. &quot;We definitely spur each other on,&quot; Watson says of Robson, &quot;and the aim is still to reach a grand slam final one day. I feel I could do it. But I need to add more to my game and keep getting fitter and climbing towards the next level all the time. It&apos;s not going to be easy but, now that I&apos;m healthy, it&apos;s just a relief to be playing and looking forward again.&quot; Heather Watson is the official ambassador for Statoil&apos;s Heroes of Tomorrow Initiative which sponsors talented young people across sport, culture and education"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/23/gloriana-britten-66th-aldeburgh-festival-review", "publicationDate": "2013-06-22T23:05:50Z", "tags": ["Benjamin Britten", "Classical music", "Music", "Festivals", "Culture"], "sentences": ["This delicate, Buddhist-inspired work, complete with glass chimes, Taiwan temple bowls and electronics, explored Zen breathing via elements of repetition."], "title": "Gloriana; 66th Aldeburgh festival \u2013 review", "article": "Britten&apos;s Gloriana, written to honour the coronation of Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II, was a flop at its Covent Garden premiere in 1953. An unfortunate attempt to revive it \u2013 a decade later on the composer&apos;s 50th birthday \u2013 coincided with the assassination of JF Kennedy. Despite Opera North&apos;s excellent production in 1992, this queasy study of the ageing Elizabeth I, and her infatuation with the young Earl of Essex, has always seemed blighted. For Britten&apos;s centenary, as well as the diamond jubilee of the coronation, the Royal Opera has dared attempt a new staging, already seen in Hamburg, by Richard Jones. Back in the 1950s the fear was that Britten had created a grim operatic almanac for the new queen&apos;s reign: foolish or recalcitrant courtiers, unrequited crushes on young lords in yellow hose and the humiliation of being caught sans wig by the object of your desire. Today, royal hair and marbles intact, no such insult or confusion is possible. As if to prove the point, on Thursday \u2013 the day the curtain rose on Gloriana \u2013 the Queen made history as the first monarch to win the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot. Or her horse did. Equestrianism features in Gloriana too, but only with a rather tame joust at the start between two pretty young nobleman with nice ankles. Thanks to a strong ensemble cast led by Susan Bullock and Toby Spence and conducted by Paul Daniel, the production is a roaring success, even if the work itself remains a dodo. Jones is the ideal choice of director, bringing tenderness to intimate moments, splendour to the grand choruses and extensive pageantry. His suburban Tudorbethan Falstaff, currently triumphing in its Glyndebourne revival, might have been a dry run for the world he and his designer Ultz create here. The action, if such it can be called, happens as an am-dram play in a 1950s village hall, two Elizabethan eras merged into one in crazed mirror image. Our newly crowned monarch, evidently on a royal visit, walks past in &quot;La Cigale&quot; Dior-style dress, attended by a mayor and half a corporation. Prize marrows and a group of handbell enthusiasts convey notions of postwar modesty and aspiration. Locals in brown overalls, tweeds and woollies watch this enactment of merrie England, when armadas were seen off and men wore tights. All is furnished \u2013 or &quot;besprent&quot; as the dire cod-Elizabethiana text by William Plomer might have it \u2013 with bright, toy colours and visual wit. It&apos;s a wonder Britten didn&apos;t return the entire libretto to sender. The sample line &quot;Your plainings I can ne&apos;er refuse&quot; is plum Plomer, and can anyone really sing &quot;supersedeth&quot;? In words that make Wagner&apos;s views on German nationhood seem more benign, Plomer described Elizabeth I&apos;s golden fame as &quot;part of our racial memory, part of every educated or part-educated Englishman&apos;s conception of our national character and destiny&quot;. As a part-educated Englishwoman, I suggest trying that one out in thine local Tesco. As with Britten&apos;s Albert Herring, Gloriana has stopped appearing out of date and ripened into history. It is better for it. There&apos;s wonderful music, as well as superb performances from Bullock (at her best), Spence (worth the ticket just to see his smiling frolicks and let&apos;s not mention his legs), Patricia Bardon, Mark Stone, Kate Royal, Clive Bayley and everyone else, including chorus and orchestra. See it on Monday 24 June in cinemas. Tonight, the festival Britten founded with his partner, the tenor Peter Pears, ends in Snape Maltings with his most popular work, The Young Person&apos;s Guide to the Orchestra, as well as the last of this year&apos;s commissioned premieres (by Wolfgang Rihm) \u2013 a key feature of the 66th Aldeburgh festival, which has honoured Britten rather than genuflected. In a day of tribute to Jonathan Harvey, who died last year, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and conductor Ilan Volkov gave the UK premiere of 80 Breaths from Tokyo (2010). This delicate, Buddhist-inspired work, complete with glass chimes, Taiwan temple bowls and electronics, explored Zen breathing via elements of repetition. The premiere of Charlotte Bray&apos;s Fire Burning in Snow \u2013 a highlight of BCMG&apos;s Chamber Music Century \u2013 was vividly delivered by mezzo-soprano Lucy Schaufer, who even wore red shoes to match a line in Nicki Jackowska&apos;s poems. Smaller in forces yet towering in impact, Harrison Birtwistle&apos;s Songs from the Same Earth (2013) demands acute concentration. A first hearing, though the crystalline, minimal scoring is immediate in effect, takes us only to the threshold of this 40-minute cycle for tenor and piano. Ten poems, independent yet breathing the same air of memory and melancholy, begin in silence and end with a momentary gleam. The poet is David Harsent, librettist of Gawain and The Minotaur, who would never write &quot;supersedeth&quot; except under a pseudonym. Mark Padmore and pianist Andrew West matched the oscillations of text and music to perfection. All fed into their compelling performance of Schumann&apos;s Dichterliebe \u2013 a pinnacle of German lieder that Britten and Pears performed in the National Gallery in October 1942, when London was being bombed by the Luftwaffe. As if in oblique reminder, a Spitfire swooped low then circled away to invisibility, marking the dramatic start of Peter Grimes on the beach at Aldeburgh, the most talked about event of the season, not least sartorially. (Hoodies are now de rigueur at the opera.) No one present will forget Alan Oke, a noble and poetic Grimes, standing high amid upturned fishing boats, an outsider against the elements, fighting real, gusty winds to be heard. The whole enterprise, written about exhaustively elsewhere, was a feat on the part of director Tim Albery, his technical crew and his fearless singers. Each deserves highest praise for a Peter Grimes like no other. While a chill nor&apos;easterly, as Plomer might have put it, whipped around our ears, we too became part of the action. I hear rumour that the same team has its sights on Tristan und Isolde at Mousehole."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/23/chen-guangcheng-visits-taiwan", "publicationDate": "2013-06-23T07:16:00Z", "tags": ["Chen Guangcheng", "Taiwan", "China", "US foreign policy", "US news", "World news", "Human rights", "Law"], "sentences": ["The blind Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng is due to arrive in Taiwan on Sunday, a week after he suggested New York University was forcing him to leave because of pressure from Beijing.", "Chen&apos;s trip to address the Taiwanese parliament and speak at universities was overshadowed when a row broke out about the end of his tenure at NYU, where in 2012 he took up a one-year fellowship that allowed him to leave China.", "Chen&apos;s trip to Taiwan was part of his efforts to enhance freedoms and human rights for his fellow Chinese, said the tour&apos;s organiser, the Taiwan Association for China Human Rights.", "Chen&apos;s Taiwan visit offers a challenge for the country&apos;s president, Ma Ying-jeou, who has built his administration around better relations with China, from which Taiwan split amid civil war in 1949.", "China claims Taiwan as its territory and resents any Taiwanese activity that embarrasses Beijing.", "In May, the Chinese government in effect warned Chen to mind his language when he visits Taiwan.", "The Taiwanese presidential office said Ma had not scheduled a meeting with Chen.", "In Taiwan Chen is scheduled to give a news conference, address the island&apos;s legislature, meet the parliamentary Speaker, Wang Jin-pyng, and speak at universities."], "title": "Chen Guangcheng visits Taiwan", "article": "The blind Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng is due to arrive in Taiwan on Sunday, a week after he suggested New York University was forcing him to leave because of pressure from Beijing. Chen&apos;s trip to address the Taiwanese parliament and speak at universities was overshadowed when a row broke out about the end of his tenure at NYU, where in 2012 he took up a one-year fellowship that allowed him to leave China. Chen has written that soon after his arrival NYU began to come under &quot;great, unrelenting pressure&quot; from Chinese communists in US academia to force him out.  Bizarre claims then emerged that supposed supporters of Chen had given him a phone and iPad loaded with spyware and tracking capabilities when he started at NYU.  The heads of NYU strenuously denied they were bowing to pressure because they want to open a campus in Shanghai and said the deal for the university to host Chen had simply come to an end. Chen sparked a diplomatic crisis between China and the United States in 2012 when he fled to the US embassy in Beijing from house arrest. Since then he has been a special student at NYU&apos;s US-Asia Law Institute while working on a book due out this year. Chen&apos;s trip to Taiwan was part of his efforts to enhance freedoms and human rights for his fellow Chinese, said the tour&apos;s organiser, the Taiwan Association for China Human Rights. Chen&apos;s Taiwan visit offers a challenge for the country&apos;s president, Ma Ying-jeou, who has built his administration around better relations with China, from which Taiwan split amid civil war in 1949. China claims Taiwan as its territory and resents any Taiwanese activity that embarrasses Beijing. The island is a democracy but Ma is also trying to improve relations with the Communist party government on the mainland. In May, the Chinese government in effect warned Chen to mind his language when he visits Taiwan. &quot;As a Chinese citizen, on his activities overseas he should know how to protect the country&apos;s dignity and fulfil his responsibilities as a citizen,&quot; said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei. The Taiwanese presidential office said Ma had not scheduled a meeting with Chen. In Taiwan Chen is scheduled to give a news conference, address the island&apos;s legislature, meet the parliamentary Speaker, Wang Jin-pyng, and speak at universities. Chen escaped house arrest in his rural town in eastern China&apos;s Shandong province in April 2012. Chinese officials later let him move to the US with his wife and children in an arrangement negotiated with the United States. He had angered local Chinese officials by documenting complaints about forced abortions. A self-taught lawyer, Chen has criticised China&apos;s human rights records, speaking about it before a US congressional committee."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/23/wimbledon-laura-robson-independence", "publicationDate": "2013-06-23T22:06:00Z", "tags": ["Laura Robson", "Wimbledon 2013", "Wimbledon", "Tennis", "Sport"], "sentences": ["In the men&apos;s draw, there is the potential for what could be a rather one-sided battle of Britain in the second round between Murray and James Ward, who must first negotiate a way past Taiwan&apos;s Lu Yen-hsun."], "title": "Wimbledon 2013: Laura Robson's independence could be secret weapon", "article": "There are 10 British players in the singles tournament this year and unfortunately only one of them is Andy Murray. While he throws his body and soul into yet another assault on the title, the next fortnight will probably be viewed as a success for the other nine if any of them make it into the second week. Last year, once Heather Watson had gone out in the third round, Murray stood alone and it will not be a surprise if history repeats itself. As the British women&apos;s No1, Laura Robson will be subject to the greatest scrutiny, although the 19-year-old was desperately unlucky to be drawn against Russia&apos;s Maria Kirilenko, the 10th seed and a beaten quarter-finalist last year. The odds are against Robson. She disappointed at the French Open, going out in the first round, and subsequently she has lost in the second round in Birmingham and Eastbourne. Yet she has also beaten four grand slam winners in the past nine months. Kirilenko could also have done without this draw. Moreover, we are yet to discover what tweaks Robson&apos;s new coach, Miles Maclagan, has been making to her game. Robson started working with Maclagan, who has previously coached Murray, Marcos Baghdatis and Philipp Kohlschreiber, at the start of June after her decision to part company with Zeljko Krajan. She found it difficult to click with the Croatian and has found it easier with Maclagan so far. The pair have bonded over their love of golf, although the world No37 admits that Maclagan sometimes struggles to decode what goes on in the mind of a teenage girl. &quot;I&apos;m obsessed with this website which is doing this treasure hunt where you have to find the item and then on the item there&apos;s a code and then you win the item for \u00a31,&quot; Robson said. &quot;I thought I found the item yesterday so I messaged him and he replied saying: &apos;Oh my God that&apos;s like so totally awesome.&apos; Which I think was very sarcastic but I just find it very amusing. I snapchatted the text on my phone because I found it so funny.&quot; There is an independent streak to Robson and she does not mind that her mother, Kathy, is staying in Greece to look after their dogs. &quot;I love it when my mum comes to tournaments, but she has a life as well,&quot; Robson said. &quot;I think I have had to grow up quite fast, even when I was really young. &quot;I remember we had builders round our house. I had got up myself because my mum was already out with my brother and packed all my stuff for the day and got in the car \u2013 because I had a taxi \u2013 and off I went. And I remember the builder said to my mum &apos;How old is she?&apos; She said &apos;Oh yeah, 10.&apos; And he had a 10-year-old daughter who couldn&apos;t even wake herself up in the morning. So I think it&apos;s just something that I&apos;ve always been doing.&quot; Like Robson, Watson does not take on the American teenager, Madison Keys, until Tuesday, so there is a chance for someone else to make a name for themselves on Monday. It is worth keeping an eye out for Johanna Konta, who is looking to build on reaching the second round of the US Open last year, in her match against the No16 seed, Jelena Jankovic. The 22-year-old is certainly ambitious. Having switched her citizenship from Australian to British last year, she has finally nailed the first verse of the national anthem and now wants to learn the second. &quot;I&apos;ve got the first verse down completely,&quot; she said. &quot;I&apos;m going to know the second\u00a0verse.&quot; No one knows the\u00a0second verse. Elena Baltacha, older and wiser, has justified her decision not to retire after recently winning the Aegon Challenge in Nottingham. The 29-year-old, who has fully recovered from ankle surgery, has an interesting match against the unseeded Italian Flavia Pennetta, a former top-10 player, while Anne Keothavong plays Spain&apos;s Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza and Samantha Murray plays another Italian, Camila Giorgi. In the men&apos;s draw, there is the potential for what could be a rather one-sided battle of Britain in the second round between Murray and James Ward, who must first negotiate a way past Taiwan&apos;s Lu Yen-hsun. Most of the attention on Monday, though, will be on Kyle Edmund, who makes his grand slam debut against Jerzy Janowicz, the No24 seed. The 18-year-old has acquitted himself well after making the step-up to the ATP tour in the past few weeks but, in the grand British tradition, he may have to settle for heroic failure."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/24/wimbledon-elena-baltacha-brits-kyle-edmund", "publicationDate": "2013-06-24T19:51:00Z", "tags": ["Wimbledon 2013", "Sport", "Tennis", "Elena Baltacha"], "sentences": ["I feel I&apos;ve improved, playing some of the top players in the world.&quot; Ward, the British No2, will be bitterly disappointed at his 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 defeat by Yen-Hsun Lu of Taiwan."], "title": "Wimbledon 2013: British woe as local hopes fall at first hurdle", "article": "As if there was not enough pressure already on Laura Robson and Heather Watson to deliver at this year&apos;s Wimbledon, the exodus of Britons on Monday piled home hopes even more on their shoulders as they prepare for their first-round matches on Tuesday. While Andy Murray held his end up as expected, defeats for Kyle Edmund, James Ward, Elena Baltacha, Johanna Konta, Samantha Murray and Anne Keothavong made it a disappointing day for those with GB by their name. Things may not get much better as Robson, Watson and the other Briton in the draw, Tara Moore, all face tough matches. Robson, the British No1, plays the No10 seed, Maria Kirilenko of Russia; Watson takes on the rising American teenager Madison Keys and Moore faces the 29th seed, Kaia Kanepi of Estonia, who has been inside the top 20 before. Criticising the poor efforts of British players seems to be an annual sport in itself, with so few players having won matches here in recent years. But amid the inevitable finger-pointing that will follow it should be noted that each of the five were playing higher-ranked opposition. Edmund&apos;s 6-2, 6-2, 6-4 defeat by Poland&apos;s 24th seed, Jerzy Janowicz, can certainly be excused for the 18-year-old was appearing in his first senior Wimbledon. The teenager has been tipped as a real hope for the future by Murray and, although he was outplayed by the huge-hitting of the 6ft 8in Janowicz, he was given a warm ovation as he left the court. Having won his first ATP Tour match in Eastbourne recently, he has broken into the world&apos;s top 400 and seems set to go much higher. &quot;It was a tough day,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m disappointed I lost but I can&apos;t lose sight of the long-term goal and these last three weeks have been invaluable. I feel I&apos;ve improved, playing some of the top players in the world.&quot; Ward, the British No2, will be bitterly disappointed at his 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 defeat by Yen-Hsun Lu of Taiwan. Ward had seven set points in the third set but lost the tie-break 13-11 to the world No 70 and, despite a valiant effort, lost another tie-break to go out. Baltacha played her heart out, as always, but was well beaten, 6-4, 6-1 by Flavia Pennetta, an Italian once ranked in the top 10 and working her way back from injury. Having won the title in Nottingham in early Juneand having won a round in Eastbourne last week, Baltacha had hoped to lead the way for the British players but fell to the Italian&apos;s consistency and class. &quot;I think I didn&apos;t play my best,&quot; said Baltacha. &quot;I didn&apos;t play how I have been the last week and a half. I had my tactics but I think she moved well and she was very smart with how she defended today. She played very, very solid, I think more solid than probably how she has been playing recently.&quot; The 29-year-old Baltacha admitted yesterday she had actually retired last August before changing her mind after foot surgery and she still believes she has yet to peak. &quot;I&apos;ve still got another three or four years,&quot; she said. &quot;We&apos;ll see what happens. I&apos;m happy with what I&apos;ve achieved but I think I can do more.I&apos;m just hoping I won&apos;t run out of time.&quot; Konta was always likely to be up against it in her match with Jelena Jankovic, the former world No 1, and, though she battled well in the second set, went down 6-2, 7-5. The former British No1 Keothavong may have played her last grand slam match after losing 6-4, 6-0 to Spain&apos;s Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza and Murray, in her first Wimbledon appearance, lost 6-3, 6-4 to Camila Giorgi, a talented Italian."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/jun/24/andy-murray-wimbledon", "publicationDate": "2013-06-24T19:54:00Z", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Wimbledon 2013", "Wimbledon", "Tennis", "Sport"], "sentences": ["Murray won 6-4, 6-3, 6-1, a reliable graph of his growing dominance in the match, and he will now face the world No75 Yen-Hsun Lu from Taiwan, who defeated the British No2, James Ward, in four sets on Monday."], "title": "How Andy Murray has learned to make most of Wimbledon home advantage", "article": "Andy Murray did more than win a tennis match here on Monday. He secured another bucketload of hearts. Centre Court buzzed for him \u2013 just as it did when he won his Olympic gold medal last summer \u2013 and he responded to the sort of home support he values more than he once liked to admit, both when he was on fire and, even more obviously, when he was giving the tough German Benjamin Becker a few moments of encouragement about his prospects of an upset. That is a contract money cannot buy. There are any number of theories about how much the crowd can lift their hero: an ace, perhaps, on break point, a winner to finish a crucial rally. It is an intangible benefit, though, and Murray has finally tapped into it after many years of wondering firstly if it was there and then, after his glorious deeds in 2012, whether it would remain intact. It has. Perhaps the excellent BBC documentary the night before, which showed both his very human side and his dedication to his sport, has sealed the deal. It was the talk of the crowd. &quot;Did you see him crying over Dunblane?&quot; said one elderly woman on her way into Centre Court. &quot;What a fine young man he is.&quot; And a fine player he is too, a bit too good on the day for Becker, whom he beat in a solid workout at Queen&apos;s earlier this month and who fought hard to resist the world No2&apos;s considerable court wiles. Murray won 6-4, 6-3, 6-1, a reliable graph of his growing dominance in the match, and he will now face the world No75 Yen-Hsun Lu from Taiwan, who defeated the British No2, James Ward, in four sets on Monday. Defeat was never a real danger for Murray. For drama of that magnitude No1 Court next door was the theatre of choice as, simultaneously, Murray&apos;s long-time friend Rafael Nadal had to endure again the agony of an early exit from a tournament he has won twice. &quot;I knew it was going to be tough,&quot; Murray said immediately after getting a tricky assignment out of the way. &quot;There are always nerves before the first match in a grand slam.&quot; He started nervously, searching for that crucial balance on grass that troubles nearly everyone in the early stages of this tournament, and was forced to save his first break point within three minutes. Moments later he registered his first double fault, in only his second service game, and anxiety seemed briefly to grip into his tennis. But Murray&apos;s game plan was sound: pushing Becker deep and testing his application to the task with his nagging back-spin and well-placed strokes wide of his comfort zone in the middle of the baseline. Becker, however, is one of those players it is hard to believe is not better than his ranking. At no point in the 98 minutes the match lasted did he look like a world No95. Lifted by the occasion, obviously, he gave Murray a very good fight. It took a quarter of an hour for the German to crack, pushing a tight backhand into the net in the fourth game, and Murray was into his stride. His first ace after several meaty attempts sped past Becker at 126mph and Murray was looking good at 4-1 in the first set. At times Murray&apos;s precision was astonishing; at 15-all in the fifth game, he skimmed the net four times by no more than an inch before killing the rally with a drop shot that left Becker helpless a good 10 feet adrift. But the German&apos;s serve, rifled through the shortest of ball tosses, got him out of trouble, and the Scot&apos;s loose ground strokes, coupled with some poor shot selection, especially the lob, bedevilled his progress. Becker was hugely encouraged when Murray double-faulted again to drop serve in the seventh game and further pleased to save two break points to level at 4-4 after half an hour. It was a good, even fight at this point but Becker succumbed at the end of a lengthy rally, pushing a backhand long, and Murray was relieved to take the first set 6-4. As word filtered through that Nadal had gone two sets down to the Belgian Steve Darcis, Murray was having his own problems turning back Becker&apos;s determined challenge and needed a couple of big aces to hold at the start of the second. There was little in it for the next 20 minutes, as Murray waited for openings rather than continue to put blind faith in his faltering forehand. His patience paid a dividend in the eighth game when he broke, then served out the set at 6-3. As Becker slowly crumbled in the face of the steadily mounting pressure, Murray felt more comfortable. By the time his forehand winner sealed it, the smiles among his support team and family spread as easily as his own. This was a good day to avoid disaster."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2013/jun/27/tower-running-gherkin-challenge-skyscraper", "publicationDate": "2013-06-27T11:07:00Z", "tags": ["Running", "Fitness", "Life and style", "London", "UK news", "Skyscrapers"], "sentences": ["In other countries it is a competitive sport, with elite runners racing up skyscrapers including the Empire State Building in New York and the 2,046 steps of Taipei 101 in Taiwan."], "title": "Tower running: getting to the top of the Gherkin \u2026 the hard way", "article": "Before the Shard, the Cheesegrater and the Walkie Talkie was the Gherkin \u2013 and the hundreds of runners who raced up 1,000 steps to the exclusive private members&apos; bar at the top of Norman Foster&apos;s iconic skyscraper at the weekend got to enjoy stunning 360-degree views of London \u2026 and raise funds for the NSPCC.

The 6ft 8in Pole banged down 30 aces on his way to a 7-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over the No 15 seed, Nicol\u00e1s Almagro of Spain, to reach the fourth round and no one will want to face him this fortnight. Next Janowicz will have to get past the wily Austrian J\u00fcrgen Melzer. But the 22-year-old possesses the kind of power and free thinking that will be a threat to any opponent, as Murray knows, having lost to him in the Paris Masters indoors last October. Almagro, a Spaniard at his best on clay, let slip a 4-1 lead in the first set and once he had dropped that first set, his head dropped. The only thing that unsettled Janowicz was a delay to the start when they came out on court, only to leave again as a few drops of rain made play impossible. &quot;That affected me,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I was broken early in the first set. I was nervous, but I was able to come back. Right now I&apos;m playing really good tennis and I&apos;m really confident.&quot; It is the first time Janowicz has made the fourth round of a grand slam event. Having reached the third round here last year as a qualifier, he enjoyed a stunning rise up the rankings, climbing 195 places to No26 and he is seeded here for the first time, at 24. The Pole&apos;s game is an unusual mixture of power and touch. His huge serve, which averaged 130mph and peaked at 140mph, is matched by a surprisingly deft touch and he frustrated Almagro with some brilliant drop shots. Almagro should have won the first set but once Janowicz had taken the tiebreak 8-6, the Pole grew in confidence. After taking the second set, Janowicz broke in the ninth game of the third to clinch his place in the last 16. Few people would have predicted a Janowicz-Melzer fourth-round clash. Sergiy Stakhovsky, who stunned Roger Federer in round two, could not cope with the Austrian&apos;s style of play and Melzer ran out a 6-2, 2-6, 7-5, 6-3 victor. &quot;I don&apos;t mind playing big servers ,so let&apos;s see,&quot; the 32-year-old Melzer said of the prospect of playing Janowicz. &quot;The key will be to return his serve, to get a read, and get as many balls back as possible. But yeah, playing Janowicz in the fourth round at Wimbledon, you would take it. I know the highest seed is Beno\u00eft Paire if I beat Janowicz. I&apos;m playing well, I&apos;m feeling great, let&apos;s take it one at a time.&quot; Stakhovsky admitted the emotional effort of beating Federer and numerous media requests had left him a little spent. But the Ukrainian acknowledged he had got his tactics wrong. &quot;I was a break up in the third \u2013 that was a chance,&quot; he said. &quot;But in general, if I think, I just played stupid. It would be the exact word of showing how I should not play J\u00fcrgen and I should have realized that somewhere in the end of the second set.&quot; The fourth seed, David Ferrer, was below his best but fought his way to 6-3, 3-6, 7-6, 7-5 win over his fellow Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut. The French Open runner-up says he is feeling a little pain in an ankle injury and he may well be tested again when he meets Alexander Dolgopolov of Ukraine. And Tommy Haas, at 35 the oldest player in the men&apos;s draw, continued his superb form with a 6-3, 6-2, 7-5 win over Jimmy Wang of Taiwan. The 13th-seeded German has been through more than his fair share of injuries but plays Feliciano Lopez of Spain on Saturday, with the world No1 Novak Djokovic likely to be waiting in the fourth round. &quot;I&apos;m healthy right now,&quot; Haas said. &quot;I&apos;m playing good tennis. Yes, I&apos;m 35. There&apos;s nothing I can do about it. I&apos;m later in my career.

Having partially defaulted on its huge debt payments in March, Grenada is now proposing that all creditors negotiate a debt reduction. This simple idea is unheard of during debt crises that have shaken the world for the past 30 years. Grenada had a brief moment of fame in 1983, when a revolution started to build a more equal society. Land reform, social programmes and a good level of revolutionary pathos were the trademarks of that era \u2013 until the New Jewel movement began to dismantle itself. The US government under President Ronald Reagan used the opportunity of an internal coup in the Grenadian ruling party and government for a bloody cleansing operation in its backyard. Ever since, successive Grenadian governments have integrated the island into world markets. The EU gave Grenada privileged access to banana and spice exports, but US pressure through the World Trade Organisation led the EU to cut trade preferences and open markets to banana producers in Central and South America. Small-scale producers in the eastern Caribbean were decimated. The Grenadian economy was devastated again in 2004 and 2005 when hurricanes Ivan and Emily caused damage costing more than 200% of GDP. Since the loss of EU export markets, the biggest hard currency earner has been tourism, particularly the cruise ship industry. However, the industry was hit by the financial crisis in 2008, and Grenada and its neighbours suffered severe reductions in external income. Governments tried to cope with these shocks through foreign loans, but when economic growth could not be restarted quickly, debt skyrocketed. In Grenada, the debt has reached nearly 100% of national income, close to levels in European crisis countries. In March, Grenada&apos;s government stopped making payments to private creditors. Roughly 40% of the debt is owed to private bondholders, and another 40% to multilateral institutions such as the IMF, World Bank, Caribbean Development Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. The remainder is on the books of governments, including Taiwan, Kuwait and oil-rich neighbour Trinidad and Tobago. As there is no standard rules-based procedure for resolving sovereign debt crises, the Grenadian finance ministry, which has fewer staff and technical capacities than a treasurer in a medium-sized municipality in the US, has to negotiate with all its creditors in parallel, a tricky process. The bondholders are dispersed all over the world. Multilateral institutions have a policy of not negotiating their claims at all. And while governments sometimes reduce debts, there is no procedure to do so. To get a fair outcome from the financial and logistical mess, the Grenadian Conference of Churches has proposed that negotiations on reducing the debt should take place with all creditors. This would be a major step forward for Grenada, and for dealing with debt problems elsewhere in the world. The last comprehensive debt reduction deal we know of was the cancellation of much of Germany&apos;s debt in 1953, which resulted in annual debt payments falling to less than 3% of export revenues. Grenada&apos;s payments are more than 20% of export revenues. The Grenadian churches have proposed that an independent body should assess how sustainable the debt is. Under the current system, the IMF has monopolised such assessments. But the IMF is itself a major creditor, and represents the interests of powerful creditor countries. This makes it inherently biased, seeking to protect its money, and that of others such as western banks. The IMF&apos;s double role as lender and expert has led to absurd assessments by the Washington agency. The Conference of Churches is inspired by the biblical concept of cancelling debts; a jubilee. Debts do not always have to be paid, even where they have been legitimately contracted. So far, the Grenadian government has reacted positively to the proposal, and has indicated it would like to negotiate with all creditors. An IMF delegation visited the island last week. International support is needed to give Grenada the strength to stick to its course. If Grenada does stand firm, decisions on this island of 105,000 people could have implications for billions of others. The UN and many renowned economists have proposed the creation of a fair and impartial sovereign debt workout mechanism; a Grenadian debt reduction across all lenders would be a step towards making it happen. Such a body could be developed along the principles of national insolvency regulations, which protect individuals and companies from protracted crises, and make all lenders comply with debt reductions. The UK government has opposed such a mechanism. In contrast, other governments including Norway, Germany, Argentina and many of the groupings of developing countries, support the idea. On 1 July, Grenada is due to make payments on debt owed to western governments, including \u00a3270,000 to the UK. Grenada is already in default on payments to private creditors; the next step would be for these payments to be suspended, before a full debt conference. The amounts involved are huge for Grenada and tiny for the lenders. But the stakes are much higher because of the positive example that could be set by fairly dealing with a government debt crisis. It is fear of this precedent that will motivate vested interests to push Grenada into piecemeal debt reductions for a few creditors, leaving others to be paid in full, and the island in a debt crisis for years. Beyond academic discussions about how debt could actually be dealt with, this is a concrete case of a government that needs support and political backing for a pioneering effort. A successful approach in Grenada could have huge repercussions for achieving debt justice."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jul/02/rabbit-contact-lens", "publicationDate": "2013-07-02T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "sentences": ["Apple finds it difficult to divorce Samsung &gt;&gt; WSJ.com Apple has signed a deal to get TSMC of Taiwan to make its CPU chips from 2014:   Regarding the relationship with Samsung, Apple isn&apos;t the first to watch a happy tech matchup turn into a marriage\u00f3 of inconvenience when competition flares."], "title": "Boot up: wireless contact lens, Wikipedia's visual editing, Samsung's share slide and more", "article": "A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Wireless contact lens display now a reality &gt;&gt; ExtremeTech  It has finally been done: A team of US and Finnish bioengineers have embedded an antenna, radio receiver, control circuitry, and LED into a wearable contact lens.

Wikipedia:VisualEditor &gt;&gt; Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  Welcome to the portal for the VisualEditor, a new way of editing Wikipedia being developed by the Wikimedia Foundation. Editing Wikipedia at the moment requires people to learn wikimarkup, a markup language, even to make tiny corrections to an article. In 2001, this was acceptable; in 2013, it&apos;s driving contributors away. The VisualEditor allows people to edit without having to learn wikimarkup, and will, we hope, help encourage people to contribute to Wikipedia. The full timetable for the VisualEditor launch can be found below \u2014 but by the end of July 2013, we expect this to be available to users on almost all Wikipedia projects. We know that there are many users who prefer editing the raw wikitext, finding it faster and more precise. Editing purely in wikitext will remain \u2014 we have absolutely no plans to remove it \u2014 so both editors will be accessible from the toolbar above each article, and you can select the traditional editor in your user preferences.  Good news. Go Read: an open-source Google Reader clone &gt;&gt; Matt Jibson&apos;s Blog  Feed readers are difficult. One of the biggest problems with the readers I tried over the last months was scalability. While on the front page of HN, they were slow and unusable. Many then ended up restricting their demo tier to something useless or took so long to import my feeds that I just forgot about them and never went back. I wanted to architect a reader whose scale would be limited only by how much I was willing to pay for servers. Newsblur&apos;s early tweets suggested that the database was the bottle neck - they could not simply add new machines because it was not designed to use them. I chose the go runtime of app engine and attempted to design the data structures in a way that allowed concurrency. Depending on the traffic I get, we will see if I succeeded.  What&apos;s next for Agant &gt;&gt; Agant Dave Addey, founder and chief exec of the British app company:   Over the past few years, the App Store has become more and more competitive, and more and more risky with it. Agant&apos;s speciality has been high-quality, higher-value apps, often published in collaboration with our clients. Typically these are paid (rather than free or freemium) apps. Unfortunately, the iOS App Store&apos;s set-up just does not seem to support the discovery, trialling and long-term life of these kinds of high-value apps, making it difficult to justify the risk of their development. After much consideration, I&apos;ve decided that I can no longer take this risk on Agant&apos;s behalf. I&apos;ve also come to realise that business development is not my calling in life. I&apos;m a maker, not a salesperson, and the challenge of bringing in enough work to keep a small team busy and profitable, in such a competitive and difficult app marketplace, is a very hard thing to do. Agant doesn&apos;t have VC funding \u2013 it&apos;s entirely owned and managed by myself \u2013 and so the risk of paying salaries and funding development is borne directly by myself. Sadly, this isn&apos;t something I can keep doing in the current app market.  Is this a straw in the wind? If these sorts of apps can&apos;t be developed profitably, Apple has a problem. Addey has previously pointed out the problems with lack of trials in the App Store model; now that bird has come home to roost. He says that he will continue to support existing apps such as Train Times, though. HP aims to re-enter the global smartphone race &gt;&gt; Financial Express  Technology giant HP is looking at re-entering the smartphone race and is working on launching a new device, which will offer a &quot;differentiated experience&quot; to consumers. Without giving a timeline, HP Senior Director Consumer PC and Media Tablets Asia Pacific Yam Su Yin told PTI that the company is focusing on all segments including tablet PCs, notebook PCs as well as all-in-ones (AIOs). When asked if a smartphone is in the offing, she said: &quot;The answer is yes but I cannot give a timetable. It would be silly if we say no. HP has to be in the game.&quot;  If only there were a struggling smartphone company with a good reputation inside enterprises that HP could buy. Then again... Death of the salesmen: technology&apos;s threat to retail jobs &gt;&gt; The Atlantic Derek Thompson:   retail employment is following a familiar path, one already beaten by farmers and factory workers. In 1900, more than 40% of the US workforce was in agriculture. Today, that number is about 2%. In 1950, about one-third of Americans worked in manufacturing. Today, about 10% do. This is what happens to industries that are bitten by the productivity bug. Jobs are plentiful, and employment climbs and climbs, and then something happens\u2014somebody invents the tractor; somebody builds an assembly-line robot\u2014and suddenly the trend line finds itself on the long side of the mountain. Retail still employs one in nine working Americans, and retail jobs have grown since the bottom of the Great Recession. But we might be witnessing the moment when it passes over the mountaintop. Between 1950 and 1990, retail employment grew more than 50% faster than the general workforce did. Since 1990, it&apos;s grown 50% slower. Retail now employs fewer people than it did in 1999. And those people work significantly fewer hours, too.  Of course the article&apos;s title is a snappy play on the name of the play, but saleswomen are likely to be harder hit. Samsung slides equivalent of Sony as S4 sales disappoint &gt;&gt; Bloomberg  Manufacturers of high-end models in the $358bn mobile-phone industry are suffering as consumers hold off on buying expensive handsets that aren&apos;t considered innovative. Apple fell 9.4% in the month after releasing the iPhone 5 while China&apos;s Huawei Technologies and ZTE sold smartphones costing about $100, or about an eighth the price of the S4 in South Korea. &quot;Consumers find no good reason to buy the S4 since it has no big difference with its predecessor,&quot; said Oh Sang Woo, an analyst at Leading Investment &amp; Securities in Seoul. &quot;Chinese companies are becoming a bigger threat to Samsung than any other players.&quot; The Galaxy S4 - with a 5in screen, 13-megapixel camera and motion-detecting software - is one of three high-end handsets being released by Samsung this year. The device is part of the company&apos;s plan to win customers from Apple, which was the top smartphone seller in the U.S. in the last quarter of 2012.  Ben Thompson at Stratechery forecast this at the end of April. Apple finds it difficult to divorce Samsung &gt;&gt; WSJ.com Apple has signed a deal to get TSMC of Taiwan to make its CPU chips from 2014:   Regarding the relationship with Samsung, Apple isn&apos;t the first to watch a happy tech matchup turn into a marriage\u00f3 of inconvenience when competition flares. In the 1980s, early in the PC revolution, chip maker Intel agreed to share technology with Advanced Micro Devices. Later, AMD became a major rival, and Intel spent years trying to undo the agreement. Samsung has reason to keep the Apple relationship alive. Apple is still Samsung&apos;s biggest customer for components, and a complete retreat by Apple from Samsung would hurt Samsung&apos;s earnings, analysts say. Apple&apos;s component orders from Samsung were set to hit around $10bn last year, says Mark Newman, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein in Hong Kong. That represents a significant chunk of the 67.89 trillion won ($59.13bn) Samsung posted in sales from its component business, which includes chips and displays. The Apple processor, where Samsung is currently the sole supplier, accounted for $5bn of purchases in 2012, he estimates.  The impression is more of how powerful Samsung is in the top-end components business than anything else. (May require subcription.)

Ed Davey says he regards the negotiations as a test for his commitment to produce nuclear energy at an affordable price and without subsidy by the taxpayer. The government is locked in lengthy talks with its preferred supplier, the French energy firm EDF, over a planned nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset, which would be the first in almost two decades. But Davey says EDF&apos;s chief rival, Hitachi, looks willing to make an acceptable offer on price. In a Guardian interview, he described the negotiations as a personal test since as a past nuclear sceptic he had to prove he could negotiate a price that does not represent a subsidy to the industry. Davey, a key figure in the Liberal Democrats, also argued if he could strike the right deal it would be time for environmentalists, including in his own party, to rethink their approach to nuclear. Revealing a lull in the EDF talks, he said: &quot;My main job is to make sure that this deal works for the British consumer and for British industry. We have made a hell of a lot of progress in our negotiations but we are not there yet. We are down to one or two issues, including the actual price. I am not going to sign any deal with EDF unless it is value for money, is affordable and meets the coalition agreement of no public subsidy. These are our tests and we are going to meet them. The other side know the strike price I will agree to, and they need to know I am not going to budge an inch. This has got to work for both parties.&quot; He said he had already had talks with EDF&apos;s rivals: &quot;Sometimes people said it is EDF or bust. I would like to do a deal with EDF but we don&apos;t have to. I was in Korea and Japan recently talking to other investors and vendors. Their interest in the UK market was massive. I got the very strong impression that the sort of price I was happy to agree with EDF, they could match.&quot; He added: &quot;I am determined that the consumer or the taxpayer will not bear the risk of construction over-runs. Nuclear will get no preference in comparison with other low-carbon technologies.&quot; The long-delayed deal \u2013 likely to cover the price over the next 35 years \u2013 is seen as a litmus test of the affordability of nuclear power not just in the UK but across Europe. The new reactors are vital to hitting the government&apos;s long-term carbon-emission goals and maintaining electricity supply at a time of rising public anger at high energy prices, as well as fears of energy shortages. Davey needs to deliver a deal that balances low electricity for consumers, a secure national low-carbon energy supply and his party&apos;s opposition to nuclear power. His party opposed a new generation of nuclear reactors in its election manifesto but in 2010, in concert with its coalition partners, agreed it would let nuclear stations be built so long as the energy was not subsidised. In his interview Davey insisted he would stick to his party&apos;s promise. &quot;This is a real test for me, having made my doubts about nuclear in the past because of the price. Well, I am going to get the right price.&quot; He added measuring public subsidy has to take into account the right comparators, adding &quot;fossil fuels and gas prices are more expensive than they appear in the wholesale market&quot;, once the true cost of carbon is taken into account. He took on the nuclear critics, telling them: &quot;You should worry about climate change. So many environmentalists have changed their views because of the threat of climate change and the fact that nuclear is low-carbon \u2013 James Lovelock, Mark Lynas, Professor James Hansen, George Monbiot, Stephen Tindale and the late Bishop Montefiore.&quot; He added: &quot;Fifteen nuclear reactors are closing by 2023 \u2013 that is eight gigawatts of power \u2013 so much of the new nuclear is replacing old nuclear, mainly on the sites of the old reactors. Davey last week announced that EDF Electricit\u00e9 de France SA (EDF.FR) would be given guarantees of up to \u00a310bn to underwrite the loans to build the proposed plant at Hinkley Point C, so making the project more attractive to third-party investors and reducing the impact on EDF&apos;s balance sheet. He insisted that this did not represent a subsidy since the loan would be at a commercial rate. The guarantee had been seen as vital to unlocking a deal but Davey said he was waiting for EDF to reflect on his offer on the strike price, adding there was a lull in the talks. It is expected that the guaranteed fixed price for nuclear electricity will be fully linked to inflation, and last 35 years. Each power station would cost about \u00a314bn to build. They would come onstream in 2020 and 2021, so a deal would not plug the apparent short-term gaps in the UK energy supply highlighted in recent weeks, Davey argued. &quot;Nuclear is not part of the short-term or medium-term security issue, so EDF does not have us over a barrel on this. In fact our hand is a lot stronger than people realise, because we have other low-carbon options. Carbon capture and storage competition is down to two preferred bidders and we will sign agreements shortly, and that competes with nuclear. The fact that we have just got our strike price for renewables also shows we have other options. &quot;As important, and possibly more important, we have other nuclear options. Hitachi are very live options. They bought Horizon only last year and their pace of progress is truly impressive. They have already had preliminary talks with the regulator on going ahead with an examination of their nuclear reactor design. Their boiling water reactor has been used in Taiwan and Japan. Recently they bought four reactors on time and on budget.&quot; The Japanese manufacturer is planning to build up to six reactors at two sites through the Horizon Nuclear Power venture it agreed to buy in October. It has been reported that EDF, the world&apos;s largest nuclear operator, seeks a strike price of \u00a395-\u00a3100 per megawatt hour of electricity, while the government would rather settle around \u00a380-\u00a385. The current wholesale price is about \u00a348/MWh. Davey simply said the figures that have appeared in the media so far are not ones he recognises. The strike price depends on a number of factors, such as the duration of the contract, the capital cost of the project and the rate of return EDF is allowed to make on it. Davey is clearly aware that the wrong deal will cause him potentially difficult political problems in the Liberal Democrats, but says the party historically has not been completely anti-nuclear. Davey told the Guardian: &quot;The issue has never been completely black and white in our party. It is fair to say our policy at the last election was anti-nuclear and clearly there is a majority concerned about nuclear, and that is the case in the parliamentary party. I am not going to suggest otherwise. But like all those other environmentalists, many in our party are looking at climate change and have decided that is the chief environmental threat. As a result some have become genuinely pro-nuclear. Some of that is going on in the party, but there are people like me who have always been worried about the price. That is why I hope people can be reassured to know that I will be fighting very hard on that.&quot; The importance of the negotiations to the UK taxpayer can hardly be underestimated. It has been suggested a strike price of around\u00a395 per megawatt hour that was linked to inflation would yield accumulated revenues to EDF of \u00a3143.5bn over the 35 years of the contract, compared with \u00a385.75bn if the contract were not linked to inflation. These calculations are based on an assumption that there will be an eight-year planning and construction period before the 35-year price guarantee kicks in, and annual consumer price inflation of 2% over the period. Inflation stood at 2.7% in May, according to official figures, and has averaged over 2.8% in 2012 Davey is confident that a site for the waste can be located democratically. He said: &quot;In terms of the location of the decommissioning, we need to be clear we already have huge amounts of waste left over now from the first two generations of nuclear reactors and from the military programme. We have to deal with that whether we build one single new nuclear reactor or not. It has to be dealt with. The waste from new nuclear will take up less volume \u2013 that would mean a slightly larger geological waste disposal facility than was needed anyway. Do I think we can achieve that? Yes, I do.&quot; He sounds positive despite a vote by Cumbria county council earlier this year to reject underground storage. He points out the West Cumbrian council including Copeland, which houses the Sellafield nuclear site, wanted to give the scheme the go-ahead. He said: &quot;We do want this to be a voluntary democratic process and not to force it on anybody, but we do think the vote of the two borough councils strongly in favour suggests that this approach will work. It is a lot of jobs, community benefit and a lot of economic activity. Other countries are doing this \u2013 the US, Finland, France, Canada, Sweden. In fact they are ahead of us in identifying and building these facilities.&quot; He is likely to recast the franchise so a go-ahead is needed only from the councils directly affected. Britain is seeking to spur new reactors as part of a \u00a3110bn investment plan to replace ageing power plants and upgrade grids. Davey said he was seeking to create the world&apos;s first low-carbon electricity market in the early 2020s, saying no one knew what the mixture would be: clean coal, different forms of renewable or new nuclear. The least-cost pathway to our 2050 climate change target would be a mix of the energies."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/06/bob-mike-bryan-wimbledon", "publicationDate": "2013-07-06T18:15:00Z", "tags": ["Wimbledon 2013", "Wimbledon", "Tennis", "Sport"], "sentences": ["It took one hour and 36 minutes to secure the win, which made Hsieh the first player from Taiwan to be champion in one of the four tennis majors."], "title": "Bob and Mike Bryan complete the 'Golden Bryan Slam' at Wimbledon", "article": "Who said the Americans have had a poor Wimbledon?

Melo and Dodig looked unbeatable in the opening games and the brothers found themselves 4-0 down within 11 quickfire minutes, with their opponents going on to clinch the set 6-3. Mike Bryan, in particular, looked shellshocked, struggling to shake off any residual rustiness from their five-set semi-final victory and far from his usual clinical self at the net. But the 35-year-old brothers slowly worked it out, their long experience telling as their trademark heavy serves and quickfire volleys made inroads into their talented but callow opponents. At their best they move almost as a single entity connected by elastic \u2013 &quot;Bryan Bryan&quot;. The twins don&apos;t make things easy for those hoping to tell them apart by sporting identical outfits, wielding identical rackets and even bouncing on their soles in the same way as they prepare to receive. Happily Bob is a lefty while Mike is right-handed. The pair were on a 23-game winning streak going into this final and once they got going looked odds-on to make it 24. The Croatian and the Brazilian refused to surrender, at times forming an impassable wall at the net, but their communication and touch occasionally let them down at key moments. When necessary the Bryans brought their huge experience to bear, such as in the third game of the third set when they forced a pair of errors by Melo that allowed them to break. It was the same in the ninth game of the fourth, when Bob Bryan played a crashing forehand winner between his opponents to break Dodig and immediately dashed to his chairbefore serving for the match. It was in those moments that their almost telepathic understanding was most evident. They have seen off allcomers down the years, watching rival pairings endlessly revolve as they have forged an unbeatable understanding. Exactly a year ago a capacity crowd was racked with tension as Jonny Marray and his Danish partner Frederik Nielsen triumphed. The mood was more relaxed among those watching on Saturday, but there was plenty of admiration for the Bryans&apos; unique achievement. While they hold the record for the most grand slam doubles titles, a total that now stands at 15, this was &quot;just&quot; their third Wimbledon title. And as they performed their familiar chest bumping celebratory routine and embraced at the end, after a booming ace from Bob, it was clear this one meant more than most. Perhaps their joy in victory was also informed by the knowledge that they cannot carry on forever. But, having secured almost every other record going, they might just have their sights on overhauling Ken McGregor and Frank Sedgman, an Australian pair who collected seven grand slam doubles victories in a row between 1951 and 1952. Hsieh Su-Wei and China&apos;s Shuai Peng won the women&apos;s doubles. The pair&apos;s first grand slam triumph came after defeating Australian duo Ashleigh Barty and Casey Dellacqua7-6, 6-1. It took one hour and 36 minutes to secure the win, which made Hsieh the first player from Taiwan to be champion in one of the four tennis majors."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2013/jul/08/australia-economy-glenn-stevens-five", "publicationDate": "2013-07-08T04:29:00Z", "tags": ["Business", "Australia news"], "sentences": ["Stevens also noted that other countries such as Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Malaysia which have done OK in recent years have experienced a similar drop."], "title": "Australia's economy: five pointers from Glenn Stevens", "article": "The Reserve Bank governor, Glenn Stevens, gave a speech in Brisbane last week to the Economic Society of Australia. Here\u2019s what you need to know. 1. Glenn Stevens needs to work on his stand-up routine Here\u2019s a central banker joke: A Reserve Bank governor walks into a business luncheon and says: \u201cAs you may know, the Reserve Bank board in fact held its meeting here in Brisbane yesterday at which we deliberated for a very long time and then elected to sit with the cash rate unchanged.\u201d OK. Maybe you needed to be there. The punchline is \u201cwe deliberated for a very long time\u201d. That line isn\u2019t in the draft of the speech provided on the RBA\u2019s website. Stevens just indulged in a bit of deadpan humour \u2013 the joke being that they deliberated for a long time to do nothing. The problem is those who trade foreign exchange see more meaning in every single utterance of central bankers than Dan Brown does in a Renaissance painting. And so, after he said this, the Australian dollar dropped half a cent in the space of a couple minutes, all because traders thought this made it more likely the RBA will cut rates next month. Despite deputy governor Philip Lowe confirming the day after that it was indeed a &quot;light-hearted remark&quot;, the dollar has stayed down. This is actually something Stevens wants to happen, so perhaps the joke is on those who think he was joking. 2. It really is time to realise the world\u2019s economy has changed since the GFC Call this the latest episode of comedian Glenn Stevens\u2019s ongoing sitcom, Only Fools and Horses ... Still Think the Pre-GFC Period Was Normal (yes the title needs work). Stevens noted that Australia\u2019s average growth before the GFC was 3.5%. But then the world did an economic impersonation of Del Boy falling through the bar. Since then growth has averaged about 2.5%. Stevens also noted that other countries such as Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Malaysia which have done OK in recent years have experienced a similar drop. He concluded that &quot;Australia seems to be part of a broader pattern here\u201d. A pretty obvious pattern at that \u2013 high growth prior to the GFC, lower growth since.     Average annual GDP growth Photograph: /IMF world economic outlook report    So the next time someone says that comparing Australia\u2019s economy now with 2007 is a good way to judge which party is better at running the economy, suggest to them they leave the comedy to the professionals \u2013 the entire world was doing better in 2007. 3. Getting through the GFC required more luck than having a lot of mining Stevens noted that we were lucky to have mining to help us through the GFC, but we were also lucky it hit when it did. In 2007, Australia\u2019s level of sub-prime mortgages (high-risk loans made to people with few assets and poor credit history) was low but rising fast. So when the sub-prime collapse happened in America in 2008 it meant that the issue here was still just \u201ca small problem ... [that] stayed small\u201d. Had it occurred a year or so later, Australia\u2019s finance sector would have been much more vulnerable. He also noted that it was lucky we had changed our behaviour when we did. Our switch to \u201cslower borrowing, more saving\u201d actually occurred prior to the GFC. By the end of 2006 we had already decided enough mad spending was enough.     Household saving ratio Photograph: ABS    That switch helped us when the GFC hit, and has also helped keep inflation down during the last few years of the mining investment boom. So well done Australia, we made our own luck. 4. Stevens wants us to build houses The switch to saving means in Stevens\u2019s view that \u201chouseholds have accumulated a good deal of cash\u201d. He would like to see it spent on building houses, saying: \u201cIf anything, we will need to build more dwellings than we have been over recent years.\u201d But while in the Q&amp;A session afterwards he noted higher house prices was a driver of housing construction, he thought it would be a bad result if lower interest rates just led to \u201chigher prices and not more houses\u201d.     Monthly construction of private sector homes Photograph: /ABS    Private housing construction has increased a bit of late, and given the RBA last year also noted the importance of supply-side issues with housing such as land release, zoning, and housing design approvals, I\u2019m not sure Stevens is too interested in lowering interest rates further just to keep fuelling demand. 5. The future is unknown (but don\u2019t worry) In the past 21 years since our last recession, Australia\u2019s GDP has grown by around 100%. If back in 1991 you had said only 3% of that growth would be due to manufacturing, a smart response would have been to ask: \u201cWhere is the growth coming from?\u201d Stevens posed this same question last week and answered that \u201cmost of the time the answer ... is that only part of it will come from the old traditional areas, and a fair bit of it will come from new things, often things of which we are only dimly aware\u201d. This sounds unnerving \u2013 and it is \u2013 but Stevens suggests we\u2019re as well placed to achieve this transition to a different economy as ever before. In the past 50 years whenever our exports boomed, high inflation followed; this time it didn\u2019t. Twenty years ago when our economy changed, it came off the back off a deep recession; this time it hasn\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t mean though that the change will be \u201csimple and easy\u201d. He noted that both sides need to continue their current aim for a surplus in the near term, and businesses need to continue to improve productivity \u201cat the enterprise level\u201d. He also referred to the Productivity Commission\u2019s \u201cto-do list\u201d which contains some politically tough measures (for example, dropping support for failing industries such as the automotive sector and tightening requirements for drought support). Stevens stressed the need for confidence and said that at present it is a bit \u201csubdued\u201d. But he concluded, albeit in his usual understated way, with an upbeat message. Our current solid economic position, together with prudent policies, should mean Australians \u201creasons for confidence about the future\u201d. And that is no joke."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/11/pc-business-microsoft-windows-8", "publicationDate": "2013-07-11T14:13:07Z", "tags": ["Computing", "Windows 8", "Microsoft", "Technology", "Technology sector", "Business", "UK news", "US news", "World news", "Lenovo"], "sentences": ["But amid a market where Taiwan&apos;s Acer and Asus saw shipments crash by more than 30% and 20% respectively, Lenovo&apos;s emergence at the top over long-time leader HP, the American PC maker and technology company, marked a figurative passing of the torch."], "title": "PC business still waning as Microsoft's Windows 8 fails to lift it", "article": "The collapse of the PC business is accelerating.

Source: Gartner/IDC    All regions saw a fall in PC shipments compared with the year-ago period \u2013 suggesting that economic factors are not the key ones. &quot;We are seeing the PC market reduction directly tied to the shrinking installed base of PCs, as inexpensive tablets displace the low-end machines used primarily for consumption in mature and developed markets,&quot; said Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner. &quot;In emerging markets, inexpensive tablets have become the first computing device for many people, who at best are deferring the purchase of a PC. This is also accounting for the collapse of the mini notebook market.&quot; The fall suggests that not only is the marketing shrinking, but that the shrinkage is accelerating.

Does it feel like governments and corporations will always get away with it in the end? Do you ask yourself what one person alone can do? Greenpeace is part of a global movement of interconnected people all standing up and joining forces to stop injustices of all kinds. And every day somewhere in the world we&apos;re winning. Earlier today, a group of six Greenpeace women activists started climbing western Europe&apos;s tallest building, the Shard, in London. As I write, they are still climbing. Their courage and determination is backed by millions of people who have joined the Save the Arctic movement and are asking Shell and others to keep their hands off the Arctic. They chose to climb the Shard because it towers over Shell&apos;s three London offices, including the oil giant&apos;s global headquarters on the south bank of the Thames. When they get to the top they plan to hang a piece of Arctic artwork. If they make it, it will be the highest successful art installation since Philippe Petit tightrope-walked between the twin towers of the World Trade Centre in 1974. But this is not all. On Wednesday morning German Greenpeace activists boarded a ship docked in Hamburg, and prevented it from leaving with a cargo of meat from endangered fin whales hunted off Iceland. Like almost every country in the world, the German government agrees that commercial whaling should be banned. But the authorities decided to let the shipment go. So four activists climbed on to the ship&apos;s mooring lines and at the stern of the ship unfurled a banner which said: &quot;Stop trading in whale meat&quot;. Suddenly this was looking like more trouble than the cargo company, Charter Unifeeder, wanted. The shipment was cancelled, the meat was not loaded, the activists came off the mooring lines and the ship will leave port short of six containers of whale meat. And just a couple of days ago, Greenpeace activists set up a hanging &quot;nuclear emergency camp&quot; on the suspension cables of the iconic Gwangandaegyo bridge in Busan, South Korea, calling for the government to widen the official nuclear evacuation zone to a 30km radius. The four activists from Korea, USA, Taiwan and Indonesia displayed banners warning the people of Busan that many of them live within that radius. Today, after three days out in the scorching sun and with a great deal of local support from passers by, our team climbed down the cables to attend a meeting at the city hall in Busan. The French government agents who bombed the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland harbour 28 years ago, thought that their act would silence the anti-nuclear protests in the Pacific. Nothing could have been further from the truth. Many say that activism changed that day. The bombing of the Rainbow Warrior was an instance when a government chose to respond to peaceful protest with deadly force, but peaceful protest has prevailed. Peaceful protest has stopped the whale meat transport in Hamburg and catalysed our campaigners meeting with Korean authorities to discuss improved nuclear emergency plans. It is my hope that our peaceful protest in London today will draw attention to Shell&apos;s reckless Arctic drilling plans. The movement to save the Arctic is growing; millions of people are resisting Shell&apos;s ambitions to drill for oil in one of the most pristine and unique environments in the world and fast-track climate change. It is obvious that too many corporations and governments do not listen and put power and profit over people, ignoring what is in the best interest of humanity. It is becoming increasingly difficult to get their attention \u2013 but one thing that we know that works is civil disobedience and peaceful protest. Every act of rebellion \u2013 no matter how seemingly insignificant \u2013 adds up."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/12/australia-coal-bulga", "publicationDate": "2013-07-12T04:44:00Z", "tags": ["Australia news", "Coal", "Kevin Rudd", "Mining", "Mining", "New Zealand"], "sentences": ["New Zealand \u2013 very quietly, lest it upset the Chinese \u2013 signed a breakthrough trade deal with Taiwan.", "It will bring immediate tariff cuts of 50% for New Zealand goods entering Taiwan.", "And the Kiwis will undoubtedly use Taiwan&apos;s proximity to China to generate extra business with China."], "title": "Coal's over \u2013 anyone for wine and cheese? | Bernard Lagan", "article": "Kevin Rudd called time on Australia&apos;s long-running mining boom. In a speech to the National Press Club on 11 July, the prime minister called a blunt end to the good times which have largely accounted for Australia&apos;s record run of 22 years of economic growth. &quot;The truth is, in 2013, the China resources boom is over,&quot; he said. Rudd&apos;s call might seem paradoxical given that it was only in April that the government&apos;s bureau of resources and energy economics put out its much anticipated bi-annual major projects report, which graphically illustrated Australia&apos;s golden decade. In the 10 year period 2003 to 2012, about 390 major projects in the resources and energy sector progressed to the &quot;committed stage&quot;; their combined value was $394bn, of which $268bn worth of projects are still under construction. Another 287 projects, valued at more than $400 billion, were either at the early &quot;publicly announced stage&quot; or at the &quot;feasibility&quot; mark in the 13 April list. Many of these projects \u2013 76 in total \u2013 were new coal mines. Not all of these mines will go ahead \u2013 some will bite the dust before raising any. The reason, as Rudd made clear in yesterday&apos;s speech, is the plummeting price of Australia&apos;s coal and iron-ore exports \u2013 which have been the great drivers of our resources boom. Growth has slowed in China. The Chinese are also moving, rapidly now, to contain their carbon emissions by accelerating their uptake of renewable energy sources such as solar power. The price for thermal coal has fallen from a peak of around $US190 a tonne in July 2008 to about $US93 in May this year. Lay-offs in the industry were inevitable, and travelers need not go far from Sydney to see and feel the effects of this downturn. As The Global Mail reports in a new multimedia feature about one town&apos;s battle to stop a coal mine expanding at Bulga in New South Wales&apos; Hunter Valley, businesses in coal-mining area are already feeling the effects of a forecast coal-mining winter. Paul Burgess, owner of Bulga&apos;s pub, the Cockfighter Creek Tavern, laments that he no longer has a crowd of mine contractors lining up for dinner and drinks on Thursday nights \u2013 the traditional end of the mining week \u2013 before they commuted back to their homes in Newcastle or Sydney. Others in the village who hold full-time jobs in the mines dotted are fearful that they are about to be laid off. James Van der Heyden, who drives a monster mining truck at Rio Tinto&apos;s Mount Thorley Warkworth mine, says, &quot;there&apos;s only a certain number of employers out there and times are getting worse and worse. Not just for mining, but for everything. We&apos;ve got no manufacturing left. That&apos;s all sort of shut down. So you&apos;ve got to work for one of the fast-food chains or something.&quot; The coal industry estimates some 9,000 jobs have been lost in the past year since the slowdown in coal began, including 3,000 jobs in New South Wales \u2013 predominantly in the Hunter Valley. Already big coal projects are being shelved.     A cow at sunrise, with Bulga in the background. Photograph: Ella Rubeli/The Global Mail    At the end of June, Aquila Resources delayed construction of its vast Queensland Eagle Downs mine. The month before, Port Waratah Coal Services, which is backed by a consortium of big miners led by Rio Tinto and Xstrata, shelved plans to build a new, highly controversial $5bn coal-export terminal at Newcastle. But it is not just the economic slowdown in China that has slowed the coal trains. Big investors have realised that the threat of global warming now means that coal consumption the world over will have to drop dramatically. After the Australian Climate Change Commission warned last month that much of Australia&apos;s large coal and coal-seam-gas reserves would have to be left in the ground if the world was to keep global warming to less than two degrees, the executive chairman of Macquarie Bank in Melbourne, Simon McKeon, said what might have been unthinkable for an Australian banker in recent years:  Anyone who believes they have literally hundreds of millions of tonnes of first-rate, high-emitting CO2 coal can no longer blindly believe there will be a strong market for that in 20, 30 years. Putting my Macquarie hat on, the best of resource investors are absolutely on to this.  No one is suggesting, of course, that Australia&apos;s coal industry will fade away immediately. But the question is, what lies beyond coal for the raft of small communities throughout the Hunter Valley, the Queensland coal towns, and the regional cities that have become coal dependent? In yesterday&apos;s speech, Rudd aptly described this as a crossover period for Australia. The lower dollar \u2013 partially induced by the mining slowdown \u2013 provides opportunities, he said, for a new phase of investment in other sectors of the Australian economy. Rudd might well have been casting an envious eye across the Tasman when he picked up the phone to speak to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on the evening of 8 July, and discussed how Australia and China might accelerate their long-running talks on a free-trade agreement. The Kiwis have had such a trade deal with China since 2008, and it is paying off big time for them. In the first half of this year, New Zealand&apos;s exports to China \u2013 mostly dairy, meat and wine \u2013 shot up by 33%. Over the same period Australia managed just a 9% jump. Negotiating a similar trade deal will be crucial for Australia&apos;s life after coal, as it will be the vehicle for a push into China by Australia&apos;s next big thing \u2013 agricultural exports. On Wednesday, Kiwi exporters got another jump on their Australian counterparts. New Zealand \u2013 very quietly, lest it upset the Chinese \u2013 signed a breakthrough trade deal with Taiwan. It will bring immediate tariff cuts of 50% for New Zealand goods entering Taiwan. And the Kiwis will undoubtedly use Taiwan&apos;s proximity to China to generate extra business with China. New Zealand, of course, has never had a resources boom, so it has had to work a lot harder and smarter to develop markets for its major export \u2013 agricultural products. Because New Zealand never became coal dependent, it is now well-positioned to sell big into China and elsewhere. That&apos;s the catching up that Kevin Rudd has his sights set on \u2013 after the resources boom. Australia&apos;s runaway mining boom has, however, left a bad taste \u2013 literally \u2013 in the mouths of those industries that stand by the best chance of filling the gap left the mining slowdown. Rosemount Estate long ago abandoned its award-winning Edinglassie and and Roxburgh vineyards in the Hunter Valley because of pollution from nearby coal mines. At the time, Philip Shaw, the former chief winemaker for the brands, said: &quot;There was a sort of oniony, garlicky flavour to the crush.&quot; He blamed the mines."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jul/15/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2013-07-15T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "sentences": ["Sales of second-generation Nexus 7 hard to reach 8 million units, say Taiwan makers &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Sources from the supply chain revealed that the new Nexus 7 features a 7in 1980 by 1200 display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor, 5-megapixel rear and 1.2-megapixel front cameras and expected price will be around US$199-249 for a model with Wi-Fi support."], "title": "Boot up: slow Android security patch, Schmidt on piracy, Nexus 7's aims, and more", "article": "A burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Android OEMs slow to roll out Bluebox Security patch &gt;&gt; ZDNet Steven Vaughan-Nichols:   The scary news was that Bluebox Security had worked out a way to break Android&apos;s security model.

Schmidt: things with Apple are better &gt;&gt; Business Insider  On Thursday, Google chairman Eric Schmidt revealed a surprising thing: Google&apos;s relationship with Apple has improved after many meetings, he said. He praised Apple alongside Google saying, &quot;These are two proud, well-run, different companies.&quot; He was talking at the Allen &amp;amp; Company Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, where the tech elite gather annually.  Remarks like this recall 19th-century French diplomacy, where the death of a famous figure was greeted with pursed lips and the comment: &quot;What did he mean by doing that?&quot; What does Google gain from Schmidt saying this? Do Things that Don&apos;t Scale &gt;&gt; Y-Combinator  One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is to do things that don&apos;t scale. A lot of would-be founders believe that startups either take off or don&apos;t. You build something, make it available, and if you&apos;ve made a better mousetrap, people beat a path to your door as promised. Or they don&apos;t, in which case the market must not exist. Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off. There may be a handful that just grew by themselves, but usually it takes some sort of push to get them going. A good metaphor would be the cranks that car engines had before they got electric starters. Once the engine was going, it would keep going, but there was a separate and laborious process to get it going.

His comments, reported by Variety, came yesterday during an impromptu chat with reporters at an annual financial conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. &quot;The industry would like us to edit the web and literally delete sites, and that goes counter to our philosophy,&quot; Schmidt is quoted as saying.  Sales of second-generation Nexus 7 hard to reach 8 million units, say Taiwan makers &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Sources from the supply chain revealed that the new Nexus 7 features a 7in 1980 by 1200 display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor, 5-megapixel rear and 1.2-megapixel front cameras and expected price will be around US$199-249 for a model with Wi-Fi support. The sources pointed out that the first-generation Nexus 7 was able to achieve strong shipments of six million units mainly because of its low price, which only a few competitors could match; however, as more players have released 7in devices with competitive prices, the second-generation Nexus 7 will no longer have a pricing advantage.  The Nexus 7 price was certainly a big advantage on release.

After Basel and Miami, the leading western art show has invested in the former British colony. Art dealers, collectors and the merely curious enjoyed an artistic &quot;fusion&quot; in late May that mixed bankable western artists with Asian stars. But the east-west paradigm is not the only one at play in the contemporary art market; a pan-Asian shift is under way and local identities are being asserted. The art market, as usually understood by the players in the art world, has moved to Hong Kong to meet Asia, and is being transformed in the process. Unnoticed by the west, the Asia-Pacific region has developed several artistic centres and is now determined to assert its own tastes and preferences, with no regard for what some would call western diktats. This awakening of contemporary art in Asia is backed by abundant regional cash. According to a 2012 study by consultants Capgemini, there are more millionaires in Asia than in the United States. To lure them to the cause of art, quality art fairs have burgeoned since 2007 in Dubai, New Delhi, Hong Kong and Singapore, with the next one, the Sydney Contemporary, due in September. They share a common characteristic, which is that the Asian component dominates. The stars here are not British (Damien Hirst) or American (Jeff Koons and Richard Prince), but Chinese (Liu Wei), Iranian (Farhad Moshiri) and Indonesian (Eko Nugroho). Every country begins its artistic initiation with its own artists. People start out liking what they know \u2013 in other words what they recognise. In Asia, collectors are paying big money to acquire works by artists perceived as national heroes, and consequently propelling artists with only a local reputation and the occasional mention in public catalogues, to stardom. Few people outside Indonesia have heard of Nyoman Masriadi, but in 2008 he sold a painting for $1m at Sotheby&apos;s. For years, countries remained focused on their own artistic scenes, but today mentalities are changing. Collectors are no longer satisfied with pushing up the value of their national treasures but are broadening their spectrum to include the whole of Asia. That is where the novelty lies. Previously, after getting a national collection together, Asian art lovers would eye the west but ignore their immediate neighbours. &quot;Today if you don&apos;t know what&apos;s happening in Indonesia or South Korea, then you&apos;re not going to understand what&apos;s happening in Belgium,&quot; said Hallam Chow, a Hong Kong-based art collector who buys works by Indonesian artists as well as Chinese ones. Some dealers such as Jean-Marc Decrop, who specialises in Chinese contemporary art, expect the Middle East and Far East to draw closer artistically. &quot;Most Indonesian collectors I know are Muslim and do the Hajj pilgrimage. I know at least five who would like to collect art from the Arab world,&quot; he said. He has just opened the first gallery in Hong Kong to bring together contemporary Arab, Iranian and Turkish artists along with young artists from South-East Asia, Tibet and Central Asia. Asian institutions are following suit. In 2012, the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo held an exhibition called Arab Express. One consequence of this interregional dialogue is that the west is no longer the sole reference point for Asian artists who are now equally happy to be exhibiting in Asia. &quot;What&apos;s happening in London or New York remains important of course, but so is what&apos;s happening in Mumbai, Jogjakarta or Tokyo,&quot; observed Philip Tinari, director of the Ullens Centre for Contemporary Art  in Beijing, which hosted the Indian Highway exhibition in 2012. This all takes time. The mainland Chinese did not develop a sudden passion for Indian art after the Indian Highway exhibition, but the seeds were sown. The market will require structuring for them to grow. A well-organised art market is based on a foundation of collectors, experts and art critics as well as museums, galleries and auction houses (in other words a first and second market), in addition to framers, insurers, transporters and even specialised bankers. Only Japan and two of the four &quot;Asian Dragons&quot;, Taiwan and South Korea, currently have all the components of this artistic ecosystem. In South Korea powerful galleries have been forming the tastes of rich buyers for the past 30 years, while in Taiwan collectors are mainly descended from the Japan-influenced elite that emerged during the Japanese occupation (1895-1945) and the Chinese bourgeoisie that fled from the mainland with Chiang Kai-shek in 1949. Elsewhere the situation varies considerably from one country to another, with a massive contrast between the millionaire Chinese artists and the &quot;peasant&quot; artists in countries that are still essentially rural, such as Indonesia and the Philippines. But the curiosity is there. Not all Asian countries have achieved the same degree of maturity but they are all preparing to meet their cultural ambitions by opening museums. Some countries such as Singapore have a policy of supporting art and culture, and even the Chinese government has understood that imperialism can be cultural too. According to the British monthly, The Art Newspaper, the number of museums in China rose from 21 in 1949 to 348 in 1978 and 3,400 today, 175 of which are dedicated to visual art. Many however, are still empty shells. In India things are moving slowly but surely. Contemporary art is still only for a tiny elite and New Delhi&apos;s National Museum of Modern Art has a low visitor rate of 18,000 per year (the Louvre, in contrast, has 10 million). Despite that, Kolkata is planning to open the Kolkata Museum of Modern Art in 2015, a 23,000 sq metre building designed by Herzog &amp; De Meuron that will mainly serve Asian art. That is also the ambition of the M+ Museum of Visual Culture, which is due to open in Hong Kong by the end of 2017 and will be twice as large as London&apos;s Tate Modern. The director, Lars Nittve, intends to devote 70% of his acquisitions budget of $218m spread over five years to Asian artists. The curators of the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi, also due to open in 2017, will devote 50% of their collection to Asia, in the broadest geographical sense of the word. Asia&apos;s emergence on the artistic scene is therefore more that a mere geographic shift. Western sellers are getting in touch with Asian buyers and this is triggering a radical overhaul reminiscent of the migration of the art markets from the European capitals to New York in the early 20th century and the dominance of the American schools that followed. Asia is as diverse as it is vast and we may soon expect a multitude of Asian schools, art fairs and new collectors endeavouring to show their supremacy to the rest of the world.

It aims to highlight librarians around the globe who have taken active steps to reinvent themselves while reinvigorating their profession. We&apos;ve picked five practical tips: \u00a0\u00a0 Join forces In this increasingly global, interconnected community, the key to success is through partnership and collaboration. No one person or organisation has the skills, tools, talent and resources to provide quality service to all users at all times. For example, Xin Li of Cornell University successfully embarked on several partnerships with China and Taiwan. Don&apos;t forget to organise and network with library professionals \u2013 you never know when a new partnership may emerge. Don&apos;t underestimate the value of joining and actively participating in professional organisations such as the International Federation of Library Associations, the American Library Association or other regional associations \u2013 or perhaps you might take the lead in helping to establish one in your area. Professional participation helps you to network and connect with others outside your own institution. Tom Nielsen (Metro) recaps how a library organisation was a conduit for its members to bring library research skills and knowhow to non-library communities in New York City. To thine own self (and patrons) be true As librarianship is changing, so too are the information needs of our constituents. We must take a long, hard, honest look at those whom we serve and how their needs have shifted in this global, online environment. Where are we succeeding? Where are we falling short? Follow the lead of Matthew Bolen and the team at Denver public library, where they developed learning and language programs to meet the needs of an increasingly Spanish-speaking immigrant population. As Amrita Madray of Adelphi University reminds us, we need to be aware of cultural and language diversity when serving international populations. Just remember: another librarian&apos;s &quot;good idea&quot; is only good for you if it answers the needs of your community. Conducting demographic studies and needs assessments are vital before you begin to create new programs and services. Embrace creativity Take a fresh look at the tools and resources already at your fingertips \u2013 even the ones that you may believe to be useless. Ben Turner of St John&apos;s University shows us how using the freely accessible but accuracy-compromised Wikipedia can be used to promote information literacy and critical thinking skills. Get out from behind that desk (figuratively and literally) Librarianship is a service profession. We should not be wedded to a traditional physical point-of-service model, but must make it possible to announce: &quot;The librarian has left the building.&quot; From Sara Wingate Gray&apos;s insights into the role of itinerant librarians in the digital age to Rachel Wightman&apos;s experiences as librarian in Kampala, Uganda, librarians around the globe have discovered both the challenges and rewards of providing service beyond the walls of the library building. Share ideas When a new idea works, tell the world. When a new idea does not work, tell them anyway. Librarians can learn from one another, even in the face of failure. Success stories are wonderful to tweak and replicate in your libraries. Others&apos; failures can be just as valuable. They often provide precious insights into lessons learned and overcoming obstacles. Either way, share what you have done through publications, presentations, blogs and other forms of social media. A case in point: the Moving Image Media Hub, created by Dorothea Coiffe of the Borough of Manhattan Community College and the City University of New York, has been made freely accessible, allowing it to be a global resource. Naturally, these are just a few examples of the way librarians are redefining how they serve communities&apos; changing needs for access, use, creation and preservation of information.

Stumbling upon The Firebird Ball eight years ago was one of the most exhilarating experiences of my 16 years as a theatre critic. Punchdrunk re-make desolate spaces. They create scenes with such density of detail, such fleshy, smelly, tarnished and glorious particularity that they make most realistic designs look sketchy. They show that the wall between verisimilitude and fantasy is leaky. They dance their stories with limber expressiveness. These assets are displayed in The Drowned Man: A Hollywood Fable, even though this is one of their less startling creations. Directed by Felix Barrett and Maxine Doyle in a former GPO sorting office next to Paddington station, it sends the audience roaming through a dusky space, spinning unguided through concentric circles of make-believe. You walk through a pine forest and tread desert sand. You mosey through the trailer park of the Temple Studios, peering into vans, one with a rumpled bed and overflowing ashtray, another filled with dolls. You glimpse the lives of actresses through the prism of medical prescriptions, tucked into brown envelopes, and dressing tables. A silver-backed hairbrush holds down a begging letter: &quot;It would mean the world to us if you would endorse our cold cream.&quot; You watch the filming of a sunny domestic romance in which, in front of matching cups and bread bin, a brand new wife shimmies around with a teatowel. As you sit on a tip-up scarlet seat in a pint-size but perfect movie house, waiting to watch Eyes Without A Face, these layers of fantasy collapse into each other. You see, swimming through the screen, audience members, poking around unawares, turned into celluloid celebrities. There is another element. I was blindfolded by a dark-shawled woman who muttered apocalyptic tales, and given a lucky charm by a wardrobe mistress whom I chased through a labyrinth of empty clothes. Neither of these encounters made it easier to excavate a story. Knowing that Woyzeck is one inspiration for the show may alert you to incidents of murder and drowning but does not give much narrative tug. Georg B\u00fcchner&apos;s grim 1837 tale is itself fragmentary. This is billed as Punchdrunk&apos;s biggest show, but the expansion is of square feet rather than imagination. The visual content is superb. Anyone who has never been Punchdrunked must attend. But it is not an advance for the company, who need to enlarge their acoustic and verbal vocabulary and move away from a horror lexicon. Devotees will find the physical and emotional landmarks of The Drowned Man familiar, and experience a sense of re-tread. Except perhaps when they consider the audience. The spectators are, after all, part of the show. They are, as usual, masked. Everywhere you look, grey, beaky faces shine implacably, contributing a last spooky circle. At the huge Faust in Wapping in 2006, these participant observers were tentative, liable to be unnerved. Now aficionados poke eagerly into a place, suss out whether there is any action and move on. They run. They follow the action in packs. They elbow. Maddeningly, some hold hands. They know how to winkle out a narrative. There is less baffled loitering and fruitful lingering. That is something of a loss. One of the distinctions of Punchdrunk was the way tiny episodes lay unobserved, waiting to be discovered. Not everything had to do with action. Spectacle threatens to overwhelm that distinction. Matt Charman has done something very clever in writing The Machine. The chess match between the Soviet genius Garry Kasparov and the chess computer Deep Blue, on which the play is based, is a tremendously dramatic confrontation, and one with cold war political resonance. It is full of extraordinary data, much of which is unobtrusively brought to light here. Yet it&apos;s fraught with difficulties as a stage play. It could be stuffily static. It could easily be reduced to an obvious, sentimental man-machine conflict.     Hadley Fraser as Garry Kasparov in The Machine: \u2018peculiarly humane\u2019. Photograph: Helen Maybanks    Charman makes it more interesting and surprising. In fleshing out the background of Kasparov \u2013 extraordinarily gifted, terribly pushed by an ambitious mother \u2013 he shows how nearly mechanised the life of a prodigy can become. In hinting at the biography of the Taiwan-born Feng-Hsiung Hsu, the brains behind Deep Blue, he makes the computer-fixated, awkward student so touching and so anxious \u2013 and so humanly truncated \u2013 that you almost want his machine to win. This turns out to be a play about outsiders transfixed and skewered by the United States, who are driven to a desperate game. Josie Rourke directs with pizazz, flashing screens and slow-motion, balletic encounters over the chessboard. The result, despite the title, is something peculiarly humane. It&apos;s the combination of global daring and local investigation that has made the Manchester international festival so indispensable. It mines the city, recovering its stories and finding out exceptional spaces in which to tell them.     Maxine Peake enthrals in The Masque of Anarchy. Photograph: Kevin Cummins    There could be no better place to hear The Masque of Anarchy than in the Albert Hall. The former Methodist meeting hall, now \u2013 hurrah \u2013 a nightclub, is steps away from the site of the Peterloo massacre, where in 1819 cavalry charged into a crowd assembled to call for parliamentary reform. Shelley&apos;s poem excoriating the rotten conditions that caused them to gather, culminates in a ringing call for resistance: &quot;Ye are many. They are few.&quot; For four nights the fine Bolton-born actress Maxine Peake gripped audiences with what seemed less like a recitation of Shelley&apos;s stanzas than their fiery incarnation. Staged by Sarah Frankcom, artistic director of the Royal Exchange, she spoke in front of a bank of candles to an audience who stood as if at a political meeting. In an empire-line white dress that alluded to the poem&apos;s date without looking like a costume, Peake began still, like a taper, clenched by the words. Then, gently pacing and stretching out her hands, she showed the poem to be not only eloquent expostulation but also an argument. She proved that dramatised poetry can enthral. The Masque of Anarchy points to another new theatrical possibility. \u2022 This article was corrected on Sunday 21 July. It originally referred to Maxine Peake as Mancunian.

In Taipei, we follow party-hopping, Xanax-necking writer Paul as he drifts from one awkward relationship to the next, ignoring voicemail warnings from his publisher not to get high before readings on a cross-country book tour, and generally goofing around. In Louisiana, he pretends to be a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, vox-popping locals on whether they think Darth Vader will die in the next Harry Potter film; on a visit to his parents in Taiwan, he drops acid in a McDonald&apos;s to video the results on his MacBook. With a neat line in offbeat analogy, Lin&apos;s writing here is more intricate \u2013 even beautiful \u2013 than you might expect, and as a portrait of an internet-shaped psyche, it&apos;s unmatched. When Paul first meets his wife, he reads &quot;all four years of her Facebook wall\u2026 one night looking at probably 1,500 of her friends&apos; photos to find any she might&apos;ve untagged.&quot; In bed, he notices that her eyes &quot;seemed to be tightly closed, which seemed like &apos;not a good sign&apos;, as he&apos;d read on her blog \u2013 or somewhere \u2013 that she liked sex with &apos;a lot of eye contact&apos;&quot;.

The US attorney who brought the charges, Preet Bharara, also hit the firm with civil money-laundering charges that would require the firm to forfeit potentially billions of dollars in assets. A 41-page indictment alleges that SAC, founded in 1992, maintained an elite group that has traded on insider information since 1999. SAC is also alleged to have hired portfolio managers specifically for their insider contact in the industries in which they traded, and failed to raise red flags when insider information was suggested as the basis for a trade. The indictment marks the culmination of a six-year investigation by Bharara. The government pursued an investigation against Cohen but apparently dropped its attempt to bring charges last month. &quot;SAC became, over time, a veritable magnet for market cheaters,&quot; Bharara said at a news conference in Manhattan. &quot;That&apos;s why the institution, and not individuals, stand accused of insider trading.&quot; He said that the charges were &quot;a predictable product of pervasive institutional failure&quot;, and added: &quot;A company reaps what it sows. SAC seeded itself with corrupt traders.&quot;  Cohen was not mentioned by name in the indictment but referred to obliquely\u00a0 as &quot;the SAC owner&quot; and an &quot;individual residing in Greenwich, Connecticut.&quot; &quot;The SAC owner failed to question candidates who implied that their &apos;edge&apos; was based on sources of inside information,&quot; the indictment says. Later, it notes: &quot;The SAC owner fostered a culture that focused on not discussing inside information too openly, rather than not seeking or trading on such information in the first place.&quot; The government&apos;s case centers on SAC&apos;s culture. It alleges that employees at SAC &quot;engaged in a pattern of obtaining inside information from dozens of publicly-traded companies across multiple industry sectors. Employees \u2026traded on inside information themselves and, at times, recommended trades to the SAC owner based on inside information.&quot; Under US securities laws, fund managers may only trade on company information that has been publicly disclosed. The indictment mentions several other SAC employees as well as employees of affiliate investment firms. One portfolio manager for Cohen-controlled Sigma Capital,\u00a0Wes Wang, is cited in connection with insider trading in eight technology stocks including Taiwan Semiconductor, Cisco, and eBay. In 2012, Wang pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Other alleged insider trading by SAC Capital mentioned in the indictment includes some of the biggest North American companies, such as Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, BlackBerry maker RIM, and Yahoo. SAC denied the allegations. It said in a statement: &quot;SAC has never encouraged, promoted or tolerated insider trading and takes its compliance and management obligations seriously. The handful of men who admit they broke the law does not reflect the honesty, integrity and character of the thousands of men and women who have worked at SAC over the past 21 years. SAC will continue to operate as we work through these matters.&quot; The chief target of the US attorney&apos;s legal strategy, according to experts, is to foil Cohen himself by attacking his deputies and the trading culture of the firm he created. Cohen controls 60% of the money in SAC Capital and has a net worth of roughly $9bn, according to Bloomberg. The indictment holds that SAC&apos;s trading culture was heavily centralized, with dozens of portfolio managers answering directly to Cohen without knowledge of what their peers in the firm were doing.  Cohen, until his legal troubles, was a towering figure on Wall Street, a billionaire unknown to much of the public but famous in the finance community for his enviable investment profits and casual style. While maintaining an intense work regimen \u2013 working at over seven computer screens in his office \u2013 he was habitually seen around the firm&apos;s Connecticut trading floor in a blue fleece vest that became almost iconic. He was known for quirks such as his disdain of ringing phones, which created a silent trading floor, and maintaining the firm&apos;s temperature at a breezy 69F so traders would not be too comfortable. For investors, he held a notable mystique: SAC was so sought-after by clients that they paid the firm a fee of 3% of the money under management and allowed the firm to take up to 50% of their investment profits, according to the indictment. SAC seemed to have a green thumb for stocks, watching them gain up to 10% in value in a single day after buying shares, and up to 15% in a month, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis in March. The swirl of legal issues around insider trading have already temporarily claimed the careers of two of Cohen&apos;s top lieutenants, Michael Steinberg and Mathew Martoma, both of whom were arrested at their homes and subsequently indicted. The government&apos;s case against Martoma accuses him of making a profit of $276m by trading on nonpublic information related to healthcare companies Wyeth and Elan. Martoma has maintained his innocence. His trial is set for November.  The indictment is the latest in a series of investigations of SAC by regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as federal prosecutors. Most recently, last week the SEC filed civil administrative charges against Cohen, arguing that he &quot;failed reasonably to supervise&quot; Steinberg and Martoma. In response to the SEC&apos;s charges, Cohen&apos;s lawyers argued, in 46-page white paper to staff, that he was too busy to read his email, and estimated he opened only 11% of his messages. As a result, they held, he could not have acted on insider tips contained in those emails. Previously, SAC and its affiliates paid a $617.5m fine to settle SEC charges on insider trading, even though a judge grew irritated that the firm would be able to pay money to absolve itself of charges without admitting or denying wrongdoing."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/blog/2013/jul/29/1", "publicationDate": "2013-07-29T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Snapchat", "Silicon Valley"], "sentences": ["How Samsung is beating Apple in China &gt;&gt; Reuters  Apple Inc this week said its revenue in Greater China, which also includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, slumped 43 percent to $4.65 billion from the previous quarter."], "title": "Boot up: Industrial Silicon Valley, Snapchat, Twitter abuse and Android gets serious", "article": "A quick burst of 11 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Not even Silicon Valley escapes history &gt;&gt; The Atlantic  The Valley was as important a manufacturing center as Detroit or Pittsburgh were.

Snapchat and the beauty of ephemeral photography &gt;&gt; TechCrunch  Traditionally photography is about preserving a moment in time; you take a picture literally because it&apos;ll last longer. The entire art is built around a quest for permanence, and archival desires. But with Snapchat, you&apos;re casting off those things you photograph almost as soon as you take the picture - in many cases it&apos;s less permanent than just continuing to look at something. For an avid hobbyist photographer, it&apos;s somewhat counterintuitive, but also very liberating.  PRISM revelations result in lost business for US cloud companies &gt;&gt; Ars Technica  The revelations about the National Security Agency&apos;s (NSA) broad monitoring of traffic and access to the data of cloud providers spurred by the actions of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden may or may not have hurt national security, depending on who you ask.

From the end of 2012 to the end of this June, Android tablet activations jumped from 10 million to 70 million. Nearly one in every two tablets sold nowadays runs Android, Google says. And of all the Android tablets sold over the last year, more than 10 percent were Google&apos;s Nexus 7, elevating the small slate to blockbuster status for the Nexus line. But as big as the growth spurt is, Android tablets still lag behind Apple&apos;s iPads -- not only is there an undeniable lack of compelling tablet apps, Google executives say hardware needs to step up, too.  How Samsung is beating Apple in China &gt;&gt; Reuters  Apple Inc this week said its revenue in Greater China, which also includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, slumped 43 percent to $4.65 billion from the previous quarter. That was also 14 percent lower from the year-ago quarter. Sales were weighed down by a sharp drop in revenues from Hong Kong. &quot;It&apos;s not totally clear why that occurred,&quot; Cook said on a conference call with analysts. Neither is it totally clear what Apple&apos;s strategy is to deal with Samsung - not to mention a host of smaller, nimbler Chinese challengers.  Steve Jobs - the least disruptive entrepreneur ever &gt;&gt; ReadWrite  There is a vogue in Silicon Valley today for disruption--the eruptive flood of change, washing away the old and leaving in place the new. Founders are courted by venture capitalists based on their brash declarations of which billion-dollar industry they will overturn. But the message of &quot;Jobs&quot; is quite different. What we learn by watching Jobs over the decades, from the &apos;70s to the earliest years of the present millennium, is that he was at his best not when he disrupted but when he took what was broken and fixed it. Disruption is facile. Disruption is easy. Disruption is ineffective. It&apos;s the technological equivalent of a temper tantrum--nothing more. What Jobs did at Apple is the exact opposite.  Apple&apos;s Boston-area team: working on speech in Nuance&apos;s backyard &gt;&gt; Xconomy  It&apos;s been one of the Boston-area tech industry&apos;s more intriguing questions for months: Just what is Apple doing here?  Today, we&apos;ve got an answer.  Apple has assembled a small team of notable names in speech technology and is looking to expand those efforts in the Boston area, industry sources tell Xconomy.  Based on their online job profiles, we can say that members of the Apple speech team here are working on Siri, the company&apos;s voice-activated virtual assistant. Details beyond that are hard to come by, however, even for others in the field.   Nuance is behind key technologies used in Siri (and Samsung&apos;s S-Voice).

The findings emerge from an annual report on the state of the Android device market, following a similar one - with the same number of downloads - carried out in 2012. They also found that the complexity of the Android installed base has expanded almost threefold, rising from 3,997 different makes and models of devices at this time in 2012 to 11,868 now. The data was gathered from the 682,000 most recent downloads of its app out of a 4m lifetime total.  The breadth of data makes it one of the most comprehensive and open reports on the state of the Android market in Europe and the US; while Google provides some detail about the versions of Android connecting to its Google Play store each month, it does not break that down by manufacturer or model. The extent of the &quot;fragmentation&quot; of Android - in which older versions are still used alongside much newer ones - is also laid bare by the data, which shows that there were eight different versions in use, of which 37.9% were on Android 4.1, aka &quot;Jelly Bean&quot; - slightly above the 32.3% figure Google shows for the proportion which accessed its store using that version of its OS. OpenSignal&apos;s app for Android and iPhone provides details of mobile coverage including maps, signal strength and available nearby Wi-Fi networks.  The astonishing complexity of the devices being used is shown in a treemap of devices, contrasting 2012 and 2013. The size of the square is proportional to the number of those devices using the OpenSignal app.     Android device fragmentation in 2012, as recorded by OpenSignal    The 2012 map is dominated by Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S2, released in May 2011 (in the top left).     Android device fragmentation in 2013, as recorded by OpenSignal    By 2013, the Samsung Galaxy S3 (released in May 2012) and S2 dominate the top spots, with the Galaxy Note 2 showing up third. The Galaxy S4, released in May 2013, has already pushed its way to the fourth spot. All but one of the top ten devices is from Samsung; the 10th is the Nexus 4, the cut-price high-end smartphone made by LG for Google. &quot;Despite the problems, fragmentation also has a great number of benefits for both developers and users,&quot; notes Samuel Johnston of OpenSignal. &quot;The availability of cheap Android phones (rarely running the most recent version) means that they have a much greater global reach than [Apple&apos;s iPhone software] iOS, so app developers have a wider audience to build for. It may be tricky to do, but the potential reward definitely makes it worthwhile. For consumers, extreme fragmentation means that they can get exactly the phone they want \u2013 big or small, cheap or expensive, with any number of different feature combinations.&quot;     Android devices by brand: Samsung is the green, making up 47.5% of those using OpenSignal's app    The data also points to a revival for Sony and LG, which a year ago had looked to be knocked out of the market - but have come back into view with the help of their corporate parents. Taiwan&apos;s HTC, meanwhile, which warned on Tuesday that it will probably make a loss in the third quarter, was pushed below Chinese rivals Huawei and ZTE in the share of devices using the app. Samsung dominates with 47.5%. &quot;Some of the brand names shown as different in the graphic are part of the same company, i.e. Moto and Motorola are the same and HTC is shown as split up into its different regional variants,&quot; explained Johnston. &quot;But even when unified under one umbrella name Motorola only ends up with a 4.2% share and HTC even less at 3.9%.&quot; A graph showing the market share of the most common API level also points to increasing fragmentation at the OS level. When the most common API level has a high market share, it indicates that more devices have a common OS. But having hit a peak of over 60% in July 2011, when Android 2.3 &quot;Gingerbread&quot; dominated, the most-used API now is a later version of Gingerbread which only has around 35% share. That compares to 95% of iOS devices accessing Apple&apos;s App Store which are running iOS 6, the latest version.     Android screens in 2013: more shapes and sizes than ever, says OpenSignal    Screens also come in a multitude of sizes both for smartphones and tablets on Android, in contrast to those for the iPhone and iPad, where there are effectively only four different ones, Johnston points out.      Apple's range of device screen sizes in 2013: a far simpler offering than for Android    Even so, Johnston points out that Android&apos;s fragmentation can also be thought of as evolutionary diversity. &quot;While fragmentation certainly poses a headache to developers who have to test and optimize on an ever-increasing number of devices, the success of the of the Android ecosystem cannot be separated from its fragmented, free-for-all, nature. Similarly, it is easy for developers to bemoan API level fragmentation, but this is part-and-parcel of device fragmentation. Cheaper devices will struggle to run the most recent versions of Android and the fragmented operating system serves as an enabler of an ecosystem that is becoming more globally, and socio-economically, inclusive,&quot; he notes. &quot;What is clear from this report is that Android fragmentation, of all varieties, is increasing. Too often this is treated as a problem with Android, rather than a strength, but we feel that this misses the bigger picture. While there are certainly problems associated with fragmentation (and as developers we know them all too well), it is wrong to suggest that it is only a downside. Apple are currently working on a lower-end device, increasing the fragmentation of their ecosystem in the process, suggesting that the Android ecosystem is not only doing something right, but doing something to be imitated.&quot; OpenSignal has made the data available for download and has also produced a PDF report."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/aug/02/britain-aid-soft-power", "publicationDate": "2013-08-02T06:00:02Z", "tags": ["Aid", "Global development", "House of Lords", "Politics"], "sentences": ["There are many examples of this, from the US cutting aid to Yemen (one of the world&apos;s poorest countries) when it failed to support the first Gulf war, to China giving aid only to countries that do not recognise Taiwan."], "title": "Soft power to the people: Britain should use aid to promote universal values | Jonathan Glennie", "article": "Another day, another parliamentary committee investigating the future of aid, this time the House of Lords select committee on soft power and the UK&apos;s influence. Soft power is the concept by Joseph Nye to describe ways in which countries nudge and cajole rather than pay or use force to further their interests. Or, as the committee&apos;s chairman put it, it is a way to &quot;promote Britain&apos;s reputation, protect its interests and ensure security in a world where the military methods of the last century or two don&apos;t always work&quot;. At the committee, I came at the question from an &quot;internationalist&quot; perspective. The significance of shifts in the geography of power is hard to exaggerate. We know about the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), and even the Civets (Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa), but countries such as Peru and the Philippines will be among the 30 largest world economies in 35 years or so, according to HSBC&apos;s projections. Developing countries and emerging economies are beginning to dominate global economic growth, and their political power is increasing as a consequence. They are also the home of rapidly increasing reserves of global savings (46% of the total according to the World Bank) and therefore, of course, the source of growing foreign investments, including aid and concessional loans. Even the smaller, low-income countries in Africa and elsewhere have become newly assertive in their dealings with other countries. Why? Because they are living in what colleagues at the Overseas Development Institute have termed an age of choice, in which many more external financing options are available to them, both private and public, to complement a vast expansion in domestic resource revenue in many countries. And they are looking to new examples of how to develop \u2013 as the exaggerated market fundamentalism of the Washington Consensus is tossed into the dustbin of history, poorer countries no longer want to be the US, or France. They want to be Brazil, or Vietnam. For Britain that means continuing the gradual decline in power that has been in trend since the end of the empire. Power is zero sum: if some countries become more powerful, other countries become relatively less powerful. Where we used to get our way, increasingly, even poor countries are saying &quot;No thanks&quot; when they do not like the modalities of aid or trade relationships, or the conditions we attach to them. One response of OECD countries to this ebbing of power has been to seek to defend advantage. Famously, the Project for a New American Century brought together neoconservatives plotting to preserve US hegemony. But as an internationalist, I am inclined against this approach. On the contrary, it is right and desirable that other countries become wealthier and more powerful \u2013 that is what development means. I want a world in which we all share roughly the same standard of living, and I care as much about the interests of other people as British interests, especially given how immensely well-off we are compared with the rest of the world. It would be illogical and absurd for someone working on poverty eradication, human rights and sustainable development to advise on how to increase the power of one of the world&apos;s richest countries. The UK has played a role in promoting great causes with its aid, from democracy and civil rights, especially gender and sexuality issues, to free healthcare and education, and peace in conflict countries. But it has also used the power of aid in shameful ways \u2013 forcing countries to privatise key industries and basic services, to eliminate subsidies to crucial industries, to open their markets to cheap imports, flying in the face of historical evidence, but suiting the interests of our corporates. The temptation in the aid business has been to use it as if it were hard power \u2013 paying for strategic advantage and economic preferment. There are many examples of this, from the US cutting aid to Yemen (one of the world&apos;s poorest countries) when it failed to support the first Gulf war, to China giving aid only to countries that do not recognise Taiwan. But the nature of soft power is that it is more nebulous. The UK is almost unique in its worthy insistence that aid is not used for political or economic gain, and it is right to do so \u2013 the best aid relinquishes control to recipients who take the lead in spending it. It does not always work, but it is more likely to, and the respect earned is the soft power the committee was interested in talking about. So aid should not be used to promote our own interests (although some of the newer donors emerging from poverty should have more leeway in this regard). It should be used to promote international public goods and universally agreed values, which implies a move from bilateral objectives towards a more rules-based international public finance regime. The question is not how the UK can safeguard its power and interests, but how it can help shepherd the transition to a world in which power, soft and hard, is spread much more evenly, for the good of all."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/02/japanese-finance-minister-taro-aso-nazi-comments", "publicationDate": "2013-08-02T15:59:01Z", "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China", "Second world war"], "sentences": ["Yet after Mao&apos;s victory in 1949, Chiang and his rump regime fled to Taiwan, and it became impossible on the mainland to suggest that they had any role in winning the war.", "Reunification with Taiwan was on the agenda, and it became a little easier to speak positively of some of the wartime efforts of the former regime."], "title": "The Japanese finance minister's Nazi comments hark back to a dark past | Rana Mitter", "article": "Constitutional reform \u00e0 la Hitler? That seemed to be the case made by Japan&apos;s finance minister, Taro Aso, earlier this week, when he suggested that his country might learn from the Nazis&apos; technique of undermining the Weimar constitution by stealth, if it wants to change the American-designed postwar constitution that prevents it rearming. On Thursday, Aso withdrew his remarks. But they were not an isolated incident. Japan and China have been in a war of words for over a year, punctuated by alarming sorties by warships and fighter jets, over the question of sovereignty over the barren islands in the East China Sea that Tokyo calls Senkaku and Beijing the Diaoyu. Both countries are in the latest stage of a crisis that began in 1937 and has never truly been resolved: Japan&apos;s invasion of China, and the unfinished business of a peace settlement in 1945 that failed to create a lasting framework for stability. The facts of that war bear remembering. On 7 July, 1937, fighting broke out between local Chinese troops and a Japanese garrison near the Marco Polo bridge, on the outskirts of Beijing. Within weeks, the fighting had expanded across China&apos;s territory. The Japanese captured China&apos;s major cities including Shanghai, Guangzhou, and notoriously Nanjing, where a massacre of thousands of Chinese civilians took place. Some 14 million or more Chinese were killed during the war, and some 80 million became refugees. Yet, despite the huge toll that the conflict cost the country, China refused to surrender, resisting until the defeat of Japan in 1945. Nearly 70 years later, neither country has fully come to terms with the war and what it means for its own politics both domestic and international. In China, the war still sits centrally in the national culture. In Nanjing, a sombre museum-cum-shrine recalls the horror of the massacre that devastated the captured capital city in December 1937. Nationwide, hundreds of thousands of videogamers, in multiplayer online games, compete to defeat Japanese armies recreated in pixels. But the view of the war in China is still heavily distorted. During the cold war, under Mao Zedong&apos;s rule, it was officially &quot;forgotten&quot; that much of the resistance, including the bulk of the fighting, was carried out by the Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek, rather than by the Communists. For example, in the desperate battle for Shanghai in autumn 1937, some 187,000 troops were killed \u2013 all serving in the Nationalist armies. Yet after Mao&apos;s victory in 1949, Chiang and his rump regime fled to Taiwan, and it became impossible on the mainland to suggest that they had any role in winning the war. This situation began to change as the cold war thawed. Reunification with Taiwan was on the agenda, and it became a little easier to speak positively of some of the wartime efforts of the former regime. But the limits remain strict to this day. Official institutions in China still speak of the leading role of the Chinese Communist party in fighting the invaders. Wartime collaboration with the Japanese, which was widespread, is rarely discussed. In Chinese public culture, the war against Japan has become a melodrama, in which good and bad are defined in stark and often cartoon-like terms. This has encouraged a zero-sum view of Sino-Japanese relations that has raised tensions in the region. Yet the Japanese political sphere has to take its share of responsibility. In recent years, a particular strain of thought has gradually received greater respectability in some quarters: the idea that Japan&apos;s war in Asia was not an invasion but a &quot;liberation&quot; from the yoke of white imperialism. This view has become embedded in Japanese popular culture through the enormously popular graphic novels of Yoshinori Kobayashi. His 1998 novel Senso-ron (On War) portrayed the Japanese army as liberators of their Asian brethren; it sold some 650,000 copies. Of course, Japan is a democracy with a lively public sphere, and there are many who condemn the view that Japan&apos;s wartime behaviour can be whitewashed, from leftist teachers&apos; unions to members of the governing LDP party, who see the new nationalism as an embarrassing nostalgia for a dark part of Japan&apos;s history that hurts the country&apos;s international image. But the growth of Japanese revisionism on the wartime experience, if not checked, could inflame tensions further between China and Japan. Having spent a decade researching the origins and effects of that earlier war between China and Japan, I&apos;m certain that the confrontation between the two countries today is not yet as dangerous as that of 1937. But the similarities are real and too close for comfort. There is no effective multilateral organisation in Asia able to resolve disputes such as those over the islands in the East China Sea. And the crisis of 1937 was triggered by two countries with strong and contrasting ideological visions that exploded into war as the result of a small, almost trivial incident. Today&apos;s politicians need to be extremely careful not to make the same mistakes. Comments like those of foreign minister, Taro Aso, are profoundly unhelpful in the creation of a more stable Asia-Pacific."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/04/caroline-criado-perez-twitter-rape-threats", "publicationDate": "2013-08-04T18:00:00Z", "tags": ["Women", "Life and style", "Twitter", "Media", "Internet", "Blogging", "Technology", "Feminism", "World news", "Caroline Criado-Perez"], "sentences": ["Every three years or so, the family would move country with him, learn a new language, fit in with a\u00a0new culture \u2013 Spain, Portugal, Taiwan, Britain."], "title": "Caroline Criado-Perez: 'Twitter has enabled people to behave in a way they wouldn't face to face'", "article": "A couple of weeks ago Caroline Criado-Perez made a memorable appearance on News at\u00a0Ten. The feminist campaigner had won her battle with the Bank of England to reinstate a woman on the back of an English banknote. She seemed as surprised as anybody that the bank had caved into her demands. She had campaigned ever since it was announced that social reformer Elizabeth Fry was to be wiped off the\u00a0fiver and replaced with Winston Churchill, leaving an all-male, all-white lineup on our English banknotes (apart from the Queen who is there only as an accident of birth). Criado-Perez had threaten to sue the bank under the 2010 Equality Act. The then Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, appeared to dismiss her request. Then, within a\u00a0week of new boss Mark Carney taking up his post, she had been invited to the bank and asked if she would accept Jane Austen on the back of a tenner. It was a\u00a0great feel-good story. Five days later, Criado-Perez was back on the news in a very different context. This time she was talking about the rape and death threats she had received on Twitter, following her victory. This story was as\u00a0depressing as the first had been inspiring. But somehow she managed to put a positive spin on it. You&apos;ve got to remember there are far more people who support me than are against me, she told Newsnight. It\u00a0rang a bit hollow. One threat would have been one too many, but she had received hundreds. Her (incorrect) address had also been been posted on\u00a0Twitter. By last Wednesday, she had temporarily left her London home for the Kent seaside. She had always planned to have a few days off, but this\u00a0had become something different. It wasn&apos;t so much a holiday as a bolthole. When I knock on the door of\u00a0the B&amp;B she is\u00a0staying in, the landlord says he has not heard of her. It\u00a0turns out that for security reasons, she has checked in\u00a0under the name of her boyfriend, Matthew. A few minutes later Criado-Perez, Matthew and their dog Poppy arrive at the B&amp;B, next to the Lillyputt fun\u00a0mini golf. This really is old-time seaside. The three of them seem in good spirits and we head for the bandstand by the Punch and Judy show. Matthew, an English literature academic, leaves us, and Criado-Perez flops into a chair. She looks through the menu and orders a tiny Mini Milk ice-cream. &quot;I just feel really stressed and tired. I do feel hungry, but I also feel slightly sick.&quot; She is still getting violent threats, and two people have now been arrested. When she was campaigning, she was getting hostile messages, she says, but they were relatively benign. &quot;Get back to the kitchen, shut up, fuck\u00a0off. That was just people being unpleasant and not liking feminists. But it was nothing that would have led me to report them to the police.&quot; Now, she is dealing with something altogether different. What kind of tweets has she received? &quot;Gosh.&quot; She looks embarrassed. &quot;So, for example, someone was talking about giving me a good smashing up the arse. Somebody said: &apos;All aboard the rape train.&apos; Some guy tweeted another guy asking if he wanted to join in raping me.&quot; Then there were the death threats. &quot;One was from a really bright guy who said: &apos;I&apos;ve just got released from prison.&apos;&quot; She shows me her phone: &quot;I&apos;d do a lot worse than rape you. I&apos;ve just got out of prison and would happily do more time to see you berried [sic]. #10feetunder.&quot; The tweet is signed Ayekayesa. There is another one, equally chilling. &quot;I will find you, and you don&apos;t want to know what I will do when I do. You&apos;re pathetic. Kill yourself. Before I\u00a0do. #Godie.&quot; She looks away from her phone. &quot;Nice guy! He&apos;s not been arrested as far as I know.&quot; I tell her that I&apos;m amazed that she has managed to stay so calm about it. On Newsnight, she seemed almost buoyant. As soon as I say it, she lets down her guard. &quot;I have broken down pretty much every day since this happened. But I don&apos;t want to give them the satisfaction of knowing they are getting to me. I feel it&apos;s my responsibility to maintain this defiant stance of: &apos;Fuck you, you are not getting to me and you&apos;re not going to win.&apos;&quot; There is an endearing guilelessness to Criado-Perez. For all that she is determined to look strong \u2013 and is in many ways admirably so \u2013 she is anything but a practised politician. Talk to her long enough, and she will say just how vulnerable and violated this whole thing has made her feel, even if that is just what the trolls (Twitter abusers) want to hear. &quot;I felt really sick, to be honest. And horrified. It&apos;s not like I didn&apos;t know this happened to women, but to see it in front of you, directed at you ...&quot; Poppy is standing on her knee, licking her face as she talks. &quot;Sit down Poppy \u2026 And while I&apos;m not necessarily walking round in fear all the time, it has come to my attention when various things have happened ...&quot; That&apos;s another thing, she says \u2013 her sentences have become fractured and she can&apos;t find the right words. &quot;I was in the car with Matthew and he held out his phone and said: &apos;We need to talk about this&apos; with a very serious face, and my immediate thought was somebody had\u00a0found where I lived and had made a direct threat. The same thing happened when a journalist knocked on my door at 10.15pm. My immediate thought was ...&quot; She comes to a stop. &quot;That brought home to me that I am really scared, and I&apos;ve got this fear and tension bubbling up underneath the surface all the time. And I guess that&apos;s why really I can&apos;t eat.&quot; She takes an incisive bite out of her Mini Milk and the positivity returns. &quot;But it is important to remember there are so many more of us than them. It can feel they are unbeatable, there are too many of them \u2026 don&apos;t feed the trolls, just ignore them, there&apos;s nothing you can do about that ... bollocks to that. I don&apos;t want to live in that world.&quot; Criado-Perez, 29, was born in Brazil to an Argentinian father and an English mother. Her father, a self-made businessman who started out selling handmade dolls on the streets, went round the world troubleshooting for supermarkets. Every three years or so, the family would move country with him, learn a new language, fit in with a\u00a0new culture \u2013 Spain, Portugal, Taiwan, Britain. Criado-Perez initially spoke English with a Spanish accent, but nowadays it is cut-glass. Her history is fascinating \u2013 every time you think she has finished telling you about her childhood, she embarks on another chapter. At times it sounds like a magic realist novel. She tells me how her father&apos;s family left Argentina \u2013 just as they were about to depart on a\u00a0ship, her grandfather told her father that he was staying behind and would not be seeing them again. It was her father&apos;s duty to inform his mother and younger siblings because he was the oldest son. A generation later, history repeated itself when her own parents divorced and some years later her father broke off contact with his children. The funny thing is, she says, they had been such a\u00a0close family, and the children had idolised their dad. When she was 11, her father moved to Holland and she joined her two brothers at a public school in England. She hated the \u00a0culture, which she considered to be bullying, and blames that culture for\u00a0a brother&apos;s attempted suicide \u2013 he\u00a0was later diagnosed as bipolar. As\u00a0for\u00a0Criado-Perez, she says she was\u00a0outspoken and insecure. She felt she was too loud and unladylike, and people disapproved, so she quietened down, unhappily. In her mid-teens she discovered opera, and was determined to become a singer. Then there was the year at university, dropping out, the clubbing and drugtaking period, the time working in a book shop, at a design agency, in jobs that bored her but subsidised the singing lessons. As she talks, I notice a tattoo on her upper arm. What is it? &quot;Ah, that is from a Smashing Pumpkins album cover, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. I got it when 18. I was really into the Smashing Pumpkins then.&quot; They are quite an angsty band? &quot;Yeah! Very angsty.&quot; She tells a story about herself that sums up her own angsty youth: &quot;I\u00a0stopped doing English when I was 17. It\u00a0was basically because I always came top of the class but thought it was a fluke and I was going to get found out as a fraud. Looking back, I think, how could I be so stupid? I was taken to my head of house and told I couldn&apos;t drop English, and I just said: &apos;No, no, no, I refuse.&apos;&quot; Why? She stumbles towards an answer. &quot;I didn&apos;t want the shame \u2026 I quit while I was ahead before anybody discovered that\u00a0I\u00a0wasn&apos;t good at English.&quot; Was her\u00a0conviction based on anything real?\u00a0&quot;No, it was based on me being fucking insane!&quot; When she was in her mid-20s, she finally took her English A-level, and went to study English at Oxford University. For the first time, she felt she was making something of her life. She studed gender in literature and became politicised. She had never considered herself a feminist before, but now she began to think about patriarchy and whether that had something to do with why she had felt so out of place as a loud 11-year-old and why she had doubted her abilities. She had grown up believing that girls were meant to be emotional, consumer- driven, apolitical, fluffy \u2013 and rather than questioning the stereotype, she had simply decided she didn&apos;t like being a girl or wasn&apos;t a good one. It is unusual to discover politics so late, I say. She grins. &quot;Yeah. It&apos;s like born-again Christians, they are the most vocal and passionate about it.&quot; After graduating last year at the age of 28, she began a masters in gender theory. Actually, she says, she had planned to write her dissertation this week rather than going into hiding. The more Criado-Perez studied, the more vocal she became. She started to blog and tweet about feminist issues. Last October, she was listening to a debate on teenage pregnancy on the Today programme \u2013 the panel was all-male. She was outraged and turned to Twitter to vent her fury. The following day, there was a debate on breast cancer \u2013 another all-male panel. Presenter John Humphrys sheepishly suggested they couldn&apos;t find a female expert. Criado-Perez was incandescent. But her feminism has always been more practical than ideological, and she and a friend discussed the problem and decided that if the BBC couldn&apos;t find female experts to discuss issues, they would. So they started The Women&apos;s Room \u2013 a database of women experts and campaigning group for fairer representation. &quot;It&apos;s made it easier to find women and harder to say things like &apos;We couldn&apos;t find a female breast cancer expert&apos;, because there must be 150 now on the Women&apos;s Room.&quot; Criado-Perez was on a roll. Earlier this year, when she discovered that the banishing of Fry would leave no women of achievement on English banknotes, she decided to do something about that, too. &quot;I just thought: &apos;No, I&apos;m not fucking having this.&apos;&quot; She was getting gobbier by the day? She shakes her head. &quot;Feminism gave me a\u00a0right to speak that I didn&apos;t feel I\u00a0had beforehand. Without feminism I\u00a0don&apos;t think I would have started blogging because I would have thought who the fuck am I, why would anyone be interested? Whereas, because of feminism, I now feel I have a duty to speak. For example, when the police came round after the first rape threat and said: &apos;Do you want to take this guy to court?&apos;, my first thought was &apos;Not really, because there might be awful repercussions and I&apos;m a bit scared&apos;. But\u00a0because of feminism, I feel I have a\u00a0duty to take it to court and to see it through.&quot; She checks her texts for the first time in hours and looks upset. &quot;Oh dear, something else has happened. Stella&apos;s just sent me a text saying: &apos;So angry that this is still happening.&apos;&quot; The Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has also receiving threats on Twitter, has been supporting Criado-Perez. I ask Criado-Perez why she thinks social media has unleashed this plague of misogyny. &quot;It&apos;s been going on for millennia. Women have always been put in their place and kept there through the threat of sexual violence. What social media has done is enable people to behave in way they wouldn&apos;t face to face. There&apos;s a feeling that they are anonymous and people can&apos;t find them, and there&apos;s also research into how people need to see a face in order to feel empathy, and if you don&apos;t have that then you feel you can fire off this sort of stuff.&quot; Why does she think has she become such a target? &quot;I&apos;m going against what you&apos;re supposed to do; I&apos;m shouting back at them, getting them arrested. I\u00a0think that&apos;s wound up the extreme ones even more.&quot; Criado-Perez is about to finish her MSc and needs to find a job, hopefully campaigning for the things she cares about. There is lots of work still to do. She has not even finished with Jane Austen yet. She is chuffed that they have chosen the author, but not so happy about the accompanying quote. &quot;It is a\u00a0rubbish quotation. &apos;There is no pleasure, I declare, like reading,&apos; or something like that. It shows they just don&apos;t understand Jane Austen. It&apos;s said by a really vapid character who we&apos;re not meant to like. I think what would be lovely is if they put one of her quotations about women being written out of history up there, because it would be a nice statement and an acknowledgement that they are changing their ways. I think a really good one would be from Persuasion, where a guy says to Anne Elliot: &apos;I can point you to any historical book and you can just see women behaving badly&apos;, and she replies: &apos;Men have had every advantage over us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands.&apos;&quot; With that, Criado-Perez, Matthew and Poppy head off for a walk along the\u00a0beach. That afternoon, the Twitter trolling reaches a new low. Women MPs and journalists who have supported Criado-Perez are sent tweets telling them their homes are about to be bombed. She emails me in the evening. &quot;Just got another quite graphic death threat \u2026 not sure what&apos;s happened today and why it kicked off so much.&quot; But she is still managing to find the positive in it. Look, she says, at least it is forcing us to have a debate. &quot;It&apos;s like Twitter&apos;s just started vomiting up hatred and bile, and now it&apos;s moved beyond me and loads of women are being targeted in this really bizarre way. It feels as if we are really doing something now, like we&apos;re lancing the boil or whatever rubbish metaphor you want to use. We&apos;ve got to go through this really horrible process and at the end, we&apos;ll have got rid of it all.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 20 April 2015 to correct some personal details."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/aug/05/twitter-ios7-windows-lenovo-hacking", "publicationDate": "2013-08-05T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google", "Motorola"], "sentences": ["Another time, its Taiwan branch paid students to diss HTC on some forums."], "title": "Boot up: rethinking Twitter, Lenovo falsely accused, iOS 7 views, and more", "article": "A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Twitter.

Something should have occurred to folks writing the story. Why, in the midst of a huge NSA dust-up on spying and during a time when folks were mostly focused on mobile devices, would there be an investigation on PCs from China?

I have found myself using more and more Google apps on my iPhone over the past 18 months or so. Google Maps replaced (surprise) Apple Maps, Gmail replaced Apple Mail, Chrome replaced Safari. I did voice search through Google&apos;s search app, not Siri. And so on. Why? Because Google&apos;s services are not only much more powerful but also very neatly integrated. The amazing Google Now is the best example for that. In fact, I was already using a Google phone running iOS underneath, and there&apos;s simply nothing in iOS 7 that makes me think I might switch back to Apple&apos;s stock apps. There&apos;s just frustration that iOS 7 has barely caught up with Android&apos;s current state.  Alternatively... App updates for iOS 7 &gt;&gt; furbo.org Craig Hockenbery:   While cranking along on the update, a couple of thoughts occurred to me: how many other developers were doing the same thing and were they going to commit fully to iOS 7? The depth and breadth of the changes in iOS 7 makes it difficult to support older versions of the OS. So I just asked. I also included a simple question that any developer who was actively working on an update would be able to answer as a sort of CAPTCHA. After a little over 24 hours, I had my answers: An overwhelming number of developers are updating apps for iOS 7. Of 575 valid responses, 545 developers indicated that they were working on an update for iOS 7. That&apos;s an adoption rate of 95%! Of those developers who were working on an update, I then calculated how many were going to require iOS 7 (and drop support for iOS 6): Just over half of developers (284 of 545) were leaving the past behind. Initially I was surprised that this number was so high, but then I remembered how much time and effort I was putting into my own work :-)  Trends in Pricing and Duration &gt;&gt; The Kickstarter Blog September 2010:   A couple of weeks ago we linked to Craig Mod&apos;s gorgeous and thorough breakdown of his Kickstarter project Art Space Tokyo.

We were intrigued and impressed by Craig&apos;s research and conclusions, and we&apos;ve now compiled data from\u00a0our entire database to see how it holds up. Let&apos;s dig in.

Samsung blames ad agency for trying to bribe developers &gt;&gt; The Verge  Samsung has admitted that developers were offered money to mention its developer competition on the popular developer community Stack Overflow. In a statement issued to The Verge, the company condemns the actions, noting that they were &quot;clearly against Samsung Electronics corporate policy.&quot; The company claims it wasn&apos;t aware of the situation, and as soon as it found out that a PR firm was offering cash for content, it cancelled the plans. &quot;We remain committed to engaging in transparent and honest communications with consumers.&quot;  The followup to last Friday&apos;s revelation by Delyan Kratunov. This seems to happen awfully often with Samsung. Another time, its Taiwan branch paid students to diss HTC on some forums.

The Surface Pro pricing follows a 30% price cut on Microsoft&apos;s Surface RT tablets recently. The software maker took a $900m hit on Surface RT in its latest quarter, but Microsoft appeared to be focusing its price cuts and write-down on just the Surface RT tablet. The wording on Microsoft&apos;s Surface site appears to suggest the Surface Pro price cut is permanent.  Exclusive: Apple recently acquired low-energy chipmaker Passif &gt;&gt; jessica lessin  It&apos;s easy to see why Apple wanted Passif, which was founded several years ago by Ben Cook and Axel Berny, who were PhD students at the University of California, Berkeley. \u00a0As technology companies pack more battery-draining features into smartphones, technologies that preserve and extend battery life are critical. Radios are some of the biggest battery drainers. The need is particularly acute for wearable devices, like activity-tracking watches. One of the reasons Apple and its rivals haven&apos;t launched such devices yet is how hard it is to shrink screens, batteries and radios to fit into them.  Lessin is a former Wall Street Journal writer, now branching out with her own project. Gary Shteyngart: Confessions of a Google Glass Explorer &gt;&gt; The New Yorker  There is a tap on his shoulder. He turns around. An older man, dressed for the office in a blue blazer, says, &quot;Are those them?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;My kid wants one.&quot; &quot;If you give them to your kid, you&apos;ll be able to see everything he sees from your computer. You could follow him around all day.&quot; The businessman considers this. &quot;Are they foldable?&quot; The man with the glasses shakes his head. A young college student in a hoodie and Adidas track pants, carrying a Pace University folder, takes out one of his earbuds. &quot;What does it do?&quot; Everyone on the train is now staring at the man with the glasses. The man with the glasses jerks his head up and down. The soft pink light is on above his right eye. &quot;O.K., Glass,&quot; the man says. &quot;Take a picture.&quot; The pink light is replaced by a shot of the subway car, the college student with the earbuds, the older man, now immortalized.  A great read. Tablet shipments slow in the second quarter as vendors look to capitalise on a strong second half of 2013 &gt;&gt; IDC  As expected, worldwide tablet shipment growth slowed in the second quarter of 2013 (2Q13), according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker. Worldwide tablet shipments finally experienced a sequential decline as total volumes fell 9.7% from 1Q13. However, the 45.1m units shipped in the second quarter was up 59.6% from the same quarter in 2012, when tablet vendors shipped 28.3m devices. Lacking a new product launch in March to help spur shipments, Apple&apos;s iPad saw a lower-than-predicted shipment total of 14.6m units for the quarter, down from 19.5m in 1Q13. In years past, Apple has launched a new tablet heading into the second quarter, which resulted in strong quarter-over-quarter growth. Now, Apple is expected to launch new tablet products in the second half of the year, a move that better positions it to compete during the holiday season. Meanwhile, the other two vendors in the top three also saw a decline in their unit shipments during the quarter. Second-place Samsung shipped 8.1m units, down from 8.6m in the first quarter of 2013, although up significantly from the 2.1m units shipped in 2Q12. And third-place ASUS shipped a total of 2.0m units in 2Q13, down from 2.6m in 1Q13.  That manufacturer called &quot;Others&quot; did great, though - up from 7.4m a year before to 17.5m Will a fingerprint sensor be Apple&apos;s next hit? &gt;&gt; Invasive Code Geppy Parziale:   Let&apos;s take a look at the most critical component of the entire fingerprint recognition process: the sensor. Recognition is highly dependent on the quality of the captured fingerprint image as in less noise, and better image. The core technology used to manufacture the sensors can introduce noise and errors on the captured fingerprint image, influencing the recognition to such a negative extreme that you could be continuously rejected by the system (false rejection) or somebody else could be granted access to the system instead of you (false acceptance). There are 2 kinds of fingerprint capture methods: touchless and touch-based fingerprint capture. I pioneered the first category.  You pioneered it? Suddenly a lot more interested, Mr Parziale. A very useful primer even if Apple doesn&apos;t do anything of the sort. The Chromecast vs. Smart TV &gt;&gt; DisplaySearch Blog Paul Gagnon:   Our research indicates that the percentage of TVs which are connected will increase to 23% in North America, though this is well below the global average of 36% and behind expectations. The low adoption rate of connected TV in the US relates to the proliferation of other devices that can duplicate the function of Smart TVs for little or no money. Gaming console owners already stream from web apps. Roku and Apple TV are relatively cheap at $60-$100. The Chromecast, at $35, significantly devalues connected TV functions (and may be followed up with an Android game console). For smart TV makers, this is a big challenge. To date, their solution has been to increase the functionality, complexity and componentry of the Smart TV to compete with other devices in the home. However, this increases the cost while consumers see decreasing value in Smart TV hardware (and set makers struggle with Smart TV obsolescence). The Chromecast will widen this gap further, and appears to be a hit among tech enthusiasts.  Why would you pay $100-$200 extra for the &quot;smart&quot; functionality if you could add it for less with a Chromecast, Roku or Apple TV? Google, the freaky line and why Moto X is a game-changer &gt;&gt; The Next Web Robert Scoble (of Google Glass in the shower fame):   Yes, Google is more transparent about what they are collecting on us than most companies, but it is asking an awful lot of us. Some won&apos;t go into the contextual age easily. Lots of my friends are getting freaked out by just how much Google is collecting on us. I think that&apos;s a marketing opportunity, even while those of us who like this kind of stuff adopt it. We&apos;ll see a new kind of digital divide open over the next couple of years. Not a divide between people who can and can&apos;t afford technology but a divide between people who are willing to go over the freaky line and those who aren&apos;t. It&apos;ll be interesting to see who will go over the freaky line and who won&apos;t and what that will mean for each group. It is the biggest social shift since the Web came on the scene in 1994.  Scoble&apos;s new Big Thing is &quot;context&quot;, which arguably is what devices need to have so they can be more useful. But does our data have to be sold on? Can&apos;t we just pay companies to use our data, but without advertising at us? The idea that monetisation must mean adverts is a peculiarly American one. (Thanks @modelportfolio2003 for the link.)

Find your lost phone with Android Device Manager &gt;&gt; Official Android Blog  Have you ever lost your phone in between the couch cushions or forgot it in a restaurant? Or maybe searching for your phone before you rush out the door is part of your morning routine? Later this month, the new Android Device Manager can help you out. It&apos;s one of a few simple features you can use to keep your device\u2014and the data you store inside\u2014safe and secure. If you ended up dropping your phone between those couch cushions, Android Device Manager lets you quickly ring your phone at maximum volume so you can find it, even if it&apos;s been silenced. And in the event that your phone or tablet is out of earshot (say, at that restaurant you left it at last night), you can locate it on a map in real time.

Earlier this week, EE Times&apos; famed Chinese analyst Alice Sun posted a rather worrying rumor on Sina Weibo: apparently HTC chairwoman Cher Wang is giving up making mobile phones, and that she&apos;s already put her company on the market with a price. While Sun is usually known for reliable insights, this particular piece of gossip was quickly shot down by HTC, including China head Ray Yam who allegedly responded to a text message inquiry from Mobile China Alliance&apos;s secretary. At yesterday&apos;s corporate family day event, Wang also assured her colleagues that HTC will not be sold, according to Taiwanese publication UDN.  HTC might not get a choice. Its July revenues were down 39% year-on-year. A loss this quarter looks inevitable.

Its rear keys can be used to adjust its volume or - if pressed for a longer time - to activate the device&apos;s camera and note-taking software. LG suggests that using a back-button to take a self-portrait with the front camera also makes it easier to take a steady shot. &quot;Moving the main buttons to the back of the phone gave users more control since this place was where individuals&apos; index fingers are naturally located,&quot; it said. &quot;Researchers also found that moving the buttons also resulted in fewer dropped phones when adjusting the volume while talking.&quot;  Novel, and rather clever, idea. Apple iPhone charger teardown: quality in a tiny expensive package &gt;&gt; Ken Shirriff&apos;s blog  Disassembling Apple&apos;s diminutive inch-cube iPhone charger reveals a technologically advanced flyback switching power supply that goes beyond the typical charger. It simply takes AC input (anything between 100 and 240 volts) and produce 5 watts of smooth 5 volt power, but the circuit to do this is surprisingly complex and innovative.  Really tiny too. Transformers are really fascinating when you dig into them. (Thanks @AlanAudio for the link.) Twitter&apos;s killer new two-factor solution kicks SMS to the curb &gt;&gt; Wired.com  The new two-factor system works like this. A user enrolls using the mobile app, which generates a 2048-bit RSA keypair. The private key lives on the phone itself, and the public key is uploaded to Twitter&apos;s server. When Twitter receives a new login request with a username and password, the server sends a challenge based on a 190-bit, 32 character random nonce, to the mobile app \u2014 along with a notification that gives the user the time, location, and browser information associated with the login request. The user can then opt to approve or deny this login request. If approved, the app replies to a challenge with its private key, relays that information back to the server. The server compares that challenge with a request ID, and if it authenticates, the user is automatically logged in.  Think that&apos;s clever? Wait until you read the solution for how it does it when you don&apos;t have your phone. Shipments of second-generation Nexus 7 estimated at 3.5m in 2013 &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Global shipments of the second-generation Nexus 7 through the end of 2013 are estimated at 3.5m, mainly because the model will not be launched in the China market and there is competition from other 7in tablets, according to sources with Taiwan&apos;s supply chain. The sources pointed out that the new Nexus 7 is unable to enter the China market due to Google&apos;s decision to quit the China market in 2010 after the US company refused to comply with some of China government&apos;s Internet policies.\u2026 The first-generation Nexus 7 has shipped 6m units in total so far since it was launched in July 2012.  The Chinese government bit seems a bit odd - was China ever a target for the N7? - but Digitimes tends to be right on Taiwan-based gossip.

Meanwhile, the firm&apos;s remaining money is in the hands of a court-appointed state receiver who is preparing for a lawsuit against the victim&apos;s bank to recover the stolen funds. The heist began in December 2012 with a roughly $432,215 fraudulent wire sent from the accounts of Huntington Beach, Calif. based Efficient Services Escrow Group to a bank in Moscow.  Big money to be made (and lost) through these things. Display ratio change (again) &gt;&gt; Lenovo Blogs Matt Kohut on the official Lenovo blog:   I stated in my last post that the industry is going to go through yet another display ratio change over the next year or so. For years we&apos;ve had 4:3 &quot;square&quot; displays. These have all but disappeared from the market as the current standard is 16:10 &quot;wide.&quot; The industry is about to move yet again to true 16:9 wide. This means that the ratio of your PC display will match that of your HDTV. This change won&apos;t happen overnight, but will phase in gradually. In fact, it&apos;s already started. Many of the newest consumer notebooks, especially in the 15&quot; class, now sport the more rectangular 16:9 display. If you pay attention to this sort of thing, then you&apos;ll notice that your display gets shorter yet again vertically. For manufacturers, this makes it easier to put full size keyboards inside their notebooks (though most won&apos;t). Again, we can thank the LCD manufacturers for this change. By cutting everything in the same aspect ratio, they have less waste per large sheet of glass.  Hope you didn&apos;t think the change was driven by customer demand. (It&apos;s a fascinating blogpost with detail about minimum order quantities too.) Anonymity Smackdown: NSA vs. Tor &gt;&gt; Errata Security Pointing out that the NSA is believed to control a number of Tor (anonymity) servers:   By default, Tor chooses three hops: the ingress point, the egress point, and only a single in-between node. If the NSA is able to control one or two of these nodes, you are still okay because the third node will protect you. But, if the NSA is able to control all three, then your connection is completely unmasked. This means that the NSA occasionally gets lucky, when somebody&apos;s connection hits three NSA nodes, allowing them to unmask the user. Update: If we assume the NSA controls 1% of Tor nodes, that comes out to one-in-a-million chance the NSA will unmask somebody on any random connection. If a million connections are created per day, that means the NSA unmasks one person per day.  The last calculation is wrong, of course. There&apos;s about a 66% chance that one person will be unmasked each day. (It&apos;s 1 - (0.999999)^1000000.)

Shah Rukh Khan: A lot of colour, a lot of singing, a lot of dancing \u2013 very different original storytelling and style which has a very different screenplay format compared to the western kind of films that you see. Still a little more free flowing, a little more cabaret ... and intense and emotional. ND: What does it take to be a Bollywood star and a Bollywood heroine? For the British audience who aren\u2019t aware, Shah Rukh has been at the top of this industry for about 20 years now and the both of you are amongst the most famous people in the world. So what does it take... Deepika Padukone: He is! I\u2019m not! ND: But you could go to Taiwan, go to New York, go to London or Nairobi and people would know who you are. You\u2019re more famous than David Cameron basically. SK &amp; DP: [Laugh] ND: So what does it take to be a Bollywood hero and a Bollywood heroine? What\u2019s the magic formula? DP: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any magic formula. I think a large part of it is \u2013 I don\u2019t mean to sound philosophical \u2013 but I think a large part of it is God-given. But I think it also involves a lot of hard work, a lot of commitment, dedication, sacrifice. And I know to the outside world it seems very glamorous and it seems a lovely life to live, but it\u2019s not as easy and as glamorous as it looks. ND: What does the public demand of you on screen. What do they want from a hero and a heroine?  SK: I think because our films \u2013 the popular part of cinema \u2013 about 900 films, 50% would be the popular part of it. It requires a lot more in one film \u2013 you know we don\u2019t have a linear style of storytelling or character-driven films all the time. Like I said, there\u2019s a cabaret system of film-making.  The Indian audience varies from the very young to the very old to the very educated to the very uneducated. So if you have to tell one story trying to involve everyone in it, you have to include everything. So you have to have a little bit of intellect, you have to have a little bit of madness, you have to have a little bit of colour, you have to have a little bit of internalisation, but all this has to be put in one film.  So it does require as an actor or an actress not just to be someone trained in the art of acting, but in the art of dancing, in the art of having fun. Just saying you know what ... we\u2019re entertainers and we need to do everything we are called upon to do. So it does require a lot more faculties then just one trained linear way of thinking as an actor. ND: In Hollywood movies, you would never get an actor to sing, dance, act, be a comedian, be a romantic hero, do the tragic thing. In a Bollywood movie you have to do all of that. How physically testing is that for you both? The film itself is generally two-and-a-half hours and then you have action sequences, dance scenes - so much to do. That must be so exhausting. DP: But I think we don\u2019t... There\u2019s been no other way actually \u2013 at least for me. Right from my very first film and all of the films I\u2019ve grown up watching, it\u2019s always had a little bit of everything. It\u2019s had romance, colour, it\u2019s had action, song and dance. And I think that\u2019s what makes our films so universally appealing. A five-year-old can watch it, and an elderly person can watch it. You can watch it with your family, and you can watch it with your loved one. I mean I don\u2019t know any other way, this is how it\u2019s always been. SK: Yeah, I think you have to be. You have to be, like in cricketing terms, you have to be an all-rounder... DP: All-rounder [laughs] ...  SK: ... you can\u2019t just be the batsman, or the wicket-keeper, or just a good fielder. You have to be physically fit. And it is challenging \u2013 I mean it is as challenging for the ladies as it is the men, I think \u2013 like you said. So you may not be the best and most proficient at dancing but you\u2019ve got to do it. You\u2019ve got to do it because it\u2019s a Hindi film. Popular film I\u2019m talking about.  It is challenging, it is tough, it is difficult, and we do make those two-and-a-half hour films in about six to eight months \u2013 over 100 days, which is a longer period then perhaps a Hollywood film or British film. Normally they finish in five to six weeks of regular shooting after having some prep work. We make a film over 140 days and 150 days sometimes, because a song does require seven to eight days to shoot. Music videos I\u2019ve heard \u2013 a nice, well-honed music video - takes a month or 20 days to shoot it sometimes. We do it in four days or five days with a long song. So it is physically quite taxing. ND: You must have to work out quite a lot, the pair of you, to stay in shape. DP: [laughs] SK: You don\u2019t have to work out. The film making itself is a workout. DP: [laughs] ND: Who are your heroes? Who inspired you both to become actors yourselves? DP: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve really been inspired by \u2013 well, I admire a lot of people\u2019s work \u2013 but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever grown up saying I want to be like this person. Or I want to act like this person. ND: Is there a hero you had a crush on when you were a kid? SK: To me? DP: [laughs] Yeah, a little bit. SK: But then she met me,. And fell for me completely. DP: Yeah [laughs]. Fully. ND: And yourself Shah Rukh, who was your inspiration? DP: Me. Me! SK: As soon as she was born! Actually her dad, really. DP: [laughs] SK: Her dad was a biggie over me. ND: Your dad was a badminton player. SK: Yeah, he won the England championship. He was genuinely one of the biggest heroes as far as I was ... when I was growing up, to me, Prakash Padukone was one of the biggest heroes we had. In terms of films ... there was no one you wanted to be like, you just wanted to act. Once you got the chance ... DP: I think you\u2019ve got to create your own style, and not be like anybody else. SK: Yeah. ND: You took a non-traditional route into acting. Neither of you are from the big Bollywood families. You came in as outsiders. How has that affected your careers? Has it given you a fresh perspective, has it given you more creativity, more freedom. Or have there been more obstacles? DP: I think everyone has their own journey, their own ups and downs. Everyone has their own challenges and I don\u2019t know what it would be like for someone who has come from the film industry. I think I\u2019ve been really fortunate. I\u2019m glad that I was patient and waited for the right kind of films to come my way. Shah Rukh and Gauri [Khan] offered me on Om Shanti Om at a point on my life and career that I thought I was ready to do films. ND: Shah Rukh, in this movie your catchphrase is, \u201cthe common man\u201d, and I think that\u2019s the appeal you have to the Indian masses \u2013 that ordinary Indians love you. SK: Yeah, I think being from outside the film industry, I had no method to become a movie star, I just did whatever made me happy. Doing a little bit of English theatre \u2013 to me I just wanted to act. I did a love story after six/seven years of being in the film industry which is normally the starting point for most people. So it turned out well for me and I truly believe \u2013 and that\u2019s the maxim I go by \u2013 having seen both sides of the world \u2013 I come from a lower-middle-class background \u2013 having seen both sides of the world, I\u2019ve been treated in a very special way because I\u2019ve become a movie star and being very ordinary. So I truly believe in the maxim that it\u2019s not special to be special, but it\u2019s special to be ordinary. And that\u2019s what this film and every aspect of work is, an extension of a personality, and I believe that. ND: One last thing, Bollywood for people like me who were born here, whose family came from India, was our root back to India when we went once every year or something. How does the British audience respond to you and how do you feel towards them? SK: I feel very loved. I mean, I especially feel very, very loved. People keep saying that I make movies for the diaspora \u2013 the English or people living in England, America. But I think that I have just happened to have films which came at a time when people like you, or maybe even your family, parents or younger people, they kind of felt attachment to the country, and an attachment to the films, so I was very fortunate ... And so we stand for what India is \u2013 I\u2019m not saying this is what India is, but somewhere when you\u2019ve been staying to second, third generation away, it kind of connects you back to the country. So we feel extremely humble ... DP: I completely agree with him. I think it is just love why I come back. In fact, I was just saying to somebody, I feel like I\u2019m home. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in a foreign country or a foreign land. I feel a lot of love."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/09/dell-blackberry-match-made-heaven", "publicationDate": "2013-08-09T18:12:52Z", "tags": ["Dell", "BlackBerry", "Computing", "Technology", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones"], "sentences": ["HTC: Taiwan&apos;s smartphone maker is warning of its first-ever losses this quarter and being steamrollered in smartphones by Samsung at the high end and Chinese rivals at the low end.", "Acer: After two loss-making quarters, the Taiwanese PC maker is trying to find alternative revenue sources to Microsoft&apos;s Windows, including Google&apos;s Chrome and Android tablets.", "Exit strategy: merge with Taiwanese neighbour Asus and hope the combined PC and tablet market picks up."], "title": "Dell and BlackBerry: a match made in heaven?", "article": "Silver Lake Partners, the private equity group steering PC giant Dell to a $25bn retreat from the stockmarket, may be trying to add smartphone maker BlackBerry to the portfolio to create a corporate computing powerhouse. Executives from BlackBerry recently met Silver Lake to discuss &quot;potential collaboration&quot; in enterprise computing, according to Reuters, which also said BlackBerry&apos;s board was &quot;increasingly coming around to the idea&quot; that a private buyout would give the Canadian mobile group time to fix its problems away from the demands of the stock market. Exactly the same rationale \u2013 of working in freedom from the market&apos;s quarterly demands for profit \u2013 has been used by founder Michael Dell to justify the buyout of Dell Computer, which has been delayed due to rows over voting. A new vote will be held on 12 September. A combination could solve the two companies&apos; separate problems at a stroke \u2013 remedying Dell&apos;s lack of any significant smartphone or tablet offering, and possibly helping overcome BlackBerry&apos;s dwindling consumer base and continued losses. It could also fill a gap for large businesses which need a single vendor for secure smartphones and PCs, one analyst has suggested. Dell is struggling to cope as the PC market on which it made its name shrinks. In May it reported quarterly profits down 79% to $130m, with revenues down 2% to $14bn. Brian Gladden, Dell&apos;s chief financial officer, blamed poor uptake of Microsoft&apos;s new Windows 8 software, calling it &quot;not necessarily the catalyst that we had hoped it would be&quot; for PC sales, which overall have shrunk for the past five quarters. BlackBerry&apos;s shares have fallen by more than 19% this year alone as its new Z10 and Q10 handsets have so far failed to enthrall buyers. From a peak of $84bn in 2008, the value of the company has shrunk to less than $5bn. According to the Reuters report, one source said there was &quot;a change of tone on the board&quot; at BlackBerry as it considers its position as its smartphone shipments and global subscriber base dwindle. The company has lost $212m over the past year and dropped out of the world&apos;s top five smartphone suppliers. Its short-term cash pile has remained at around $1.5bn. Silver Lake has form as a technology matchmaker. In 2009 it bought the internet phone company Skype from eBay for $1.9bn; two years later it sold it to Microsoft for $8.9bn. It has also completed leveraged buyouts of semiconductor businesses and business phone systems. BlackBerry has already had to shift its stance in the face of competition. Its BlackBerry Messenger, once exclusive and a strong selling point that kept consumers loyal, will be offered on iPhones and Android phones this year as it tries to compete with messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Snapchat. But it is the corporate market where BlackBerry&apos;s most loyal \u2013 and potentially most valuable \u2013 customers are found. Its BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) provides robust encryption that is relied on by many financial institutions and businesses. And on Friday it had good news as the US defence department said it had approved the Z10 and Q10 software for use on its networks \u2013 potentially opening the door to huge, lucrative, long-term contracts with the US military. Dell, meanwhile, is pulling back from the declining consumer PC market and has increasingly focused on government and enterprise customers. Combining the two could produce benefits, but could it work? Benedict Evans, technology and telecoms analyst at Enders Analysis in London, said: &quot;I&apos;m not sure how being owned by Dell solves BlackBerry&apos;s problems. What does that combination do that isn&apos;t still challenged by the business environment?&quot; But he added there was still a crucial gap in the enterprise market: &quot;Dell has backed out of mobile because there isn&apos;t scope for it to be in the smartphone and tablet market. But if together they can find the right corporate story \u2013 which neither has yet \u2013 it could work. The problem is that Microsoft has dropped the ball on mobile \u2013 that means it doesn&apos;t have a compelling mobile services story for enterprises.&quot; Sources at large enterprises have told the Guardian that Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone lacks certain security features that would let them deploy handsets running the software more widely - while BlackBerry and, more recently, Apple&apos;s iPhone can be used for broader rollouts. The iPhone and iPad have already won approval for use on Pentagon networks. Asked about the reports of meetings with Silver Lake, a BlackBerry spokesperson said it &quot;does not comment on rumour and speculation&quot;. Sources close to Silver Lake denied the rumours. Five IT glitches - and their solutions  Nokia: Finland&apos;s former ruler of mobile has been thrown into loss by the rise of Samsung and Apple in smartphones. It has bought a network infrastructure business from Siemens (Nokia Siemens Networks) to provide cash and profit. Exit strategy: Microsoft is rumoured to have investigated the handset business. Selling that would leave the profitable NSN. HTC: Taiwan&apos;s smartphone maker is warning of its first-ever losses this quarter and being steamrollered in smartphones by Samsung at the high end and Chinese rivals at the low end. Exit strategy: get bought by Chinese handset maker or rising PC/smartphone group Lenovo. Politically uncomfortable. Acer: After two loss-making quarters, the Taiwanese PC maker is trying to find alternative revenue sources to Microsoft&apos;s Windows, including Google&apos;s Chrome and Android tablets. Exit strategy: merge with Taiwanese neighbour Asus and hope the combined PC and tablet market picks up. AMD: US chipmaker, continually outdone by Intel, lost $1.2bn on revenues of $5.4bn (\u00a33.4bn) last year. Its market valuation is just $2.8bn, but nobody would want it. Exit strategy: rent its existing chip foundries to companies looking to make their own chips. Or convert them into Amazon warehouses \u2013 they&apos;re big enough. Nintendo: Japanese games maker whose Wii had the wow factor in 2006 has seen sales of its new Wii U bend downwards. Smartphones and tablets now occupy more of the &quot;casual gamers&quot; it could count on. Exit strategy: kill the Wii U, offer its signature Mario and other games on iPhones and iPads, and reap the benefits."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/10/chinese-people-smugglers-arrested-spain-france", "publicationDate": "2013-08-10T22:14:10Z", "tags": ["Spain", "Crime", "Human trafficking", "Immigration and asylum", "World news", "China", "Asia Pacific", "Law", "UK news", "Europe", "France"], "sentences": ["In addition to the arrests, police said they had found dozens of fake passports, for countries including Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and Singapore."], "title": "Chinese people-smugglers arrested in joint Spanish and French raids", "article": "Joint raids in France and Spain have broken up a sophisticated people-smuggling network being operated throughout Europe that had been transporting Chinese illegal migrants mainly to the UK and US.

True, she is standing in her parents&apos; one-room home in Beijing, in a SpongeBob SquarePants T-shirt and cropped trousers. But with no ID card or household registration, there is no official acknowledgment of her life apart from a hospital form recording her birth and the fine hanging over her family. &quot;I have never been to school. I can&apos;t buy a train ticket. I can&apos;t even buy certain cold medicines, which require an identity card. I don&apos;t have medical insurance. It&apos;s impossible to get a job,&quot; said Li, who recently turned 20. Her parents&apos; refusal to pay for breaching China&apos;s strict birth control rules has left their second child without documentation and therefore without access to basic services and opportunities. The one-child policy, which actually allows a third of couples to have another baby, was supposed to be a transitional measure, but more than 30 years later it endures, despite warnings of its punitive effects on China&apos;s development and families like Li&apos;s. Repeated attempts to overturn the policy have led to marginal changes. Fresh speculation last week, suggesting a uniform two-child rule might be adopted from 2015, ended in a less dramatic announcement: authorities were considering allowing couples a second birth if one parent was an only child. &quot;This issue has been discussed for more than 20 years,&quot; said Li Jianxin, a population professor at Peking University. &quot;Many good opportunities have already been missed. The policy should have been adjusted a long time ago.&quot; Instead, it has been enforced at huge human cost \u2013 forced late-term abortions, a worsening gender gap, increased trauma and economic stress for parents who lose their only child, and punitive fines for families such as Li&apos;s. Forced abortions and sterilisations are illegal, and much less common than they were. But Sharon Hom, the executive director of Human Rights in China, said they are encouraged by family planning targets and perpetuated by the lack of effective checks against local abuses. Many people buy themselves out of trouble. One family paid a record 1.3m yuan (\u00a3136,000) fine last year. Others make hefty &quot;donations&quot; to obtain school places for undocumented children. Hom said disadvantaged individuals tend to be targeted, while celebrities and wealthy families &quot;can either afford to pay the heavy fines and/or use their government connections for immunity&quot;, exacerbating resentments. Li&apos;s parents Li Hongyu and Bai Xuling should have been allowed a second child, because both are disabled. But Bai fell pregnant unexpectedly and officials imposed a 5,000-yuan fine for their failure to get advance approval. The couple earned only 140 yuan a month. Then Bai&apos;s state-run employer fired her for breaching the rules. They have spent years pleading with officials and trying to overturn the fine through the courts for a reconsideration. The Guardian was unable to reach Beijing family planning authorities for comment despite repeated attempts. They insist they should not have to pay and that no one has told them how much it would cost to gain a hukou (household registration) for Li now Fines are cumulative, said Hom, and because they are heavy to begin with many families are either unable to pay or go into debt to do so. Li&apos;s parents now live on less than 2,000 yuan a month, for themselves and their daughter. Many suspect the fines \u2013 known as social compensation fees in recognition of the extra cost to society \u2013 give officials a strong incentive to resist reforms. Family planning also employs huge numbers of officials, and authorities fear a slew of births if the rules are eased. Officials say the birth controls have been vital to China&apos;s development and reduced the strain on the environment, preventing 400 million extra births in a country which, even so, has a population of more than 1.3 billion. But critics say the birth rate had fallen steeply before the &quot;one child&quot; rule was introduced. Even those who agree it was necessary say it is no longer needed. China&apos;s population is expected to peak in about 10 years at 1.45 billion; the working age population shrank last year. Officially the fertility rate stands at 1.7 births per couple, below the 2.1 required to maintain a stable population \u2013 and other estimates put it closer to 1.5. Yuan Xin, of Nankai University&apos;s Institute of Population and Development Research, said the policy had contributed to China&apos;s economic growth, but created unexpected problems because the population shift happened too fast. It took Britain and France 75 years to move from six to two-child families, he said. In China, it happened in 20 years. The country is now ageing at a staggering rate, with a shrinking workforce supporting a rocketing number of dependants. Some fear significant changes will come too late.&quot;All this time has been wasted on debates\u00a0\u2026 I just think we should take action as soon as possible,&quot; said Gu Baochang of Renmin University, a former government adviser and leading advocate of reform, who says local authorities should be freed to set their own policies. Pilot schemes suggest that relaxing controls will not lead to a major increase in births. Fertility rates are low across east Asia; Taiwan&apos;s is far below China&apos;s. And many urban couples now say having more than one child is simply too expensive. Li sees no point in contemplating such abstract considerations: &quot;I never think about marriage and children,&quot; she said. &quot;If I don&apos;t have a household registration, how can I get married, and how can I give my child a registration?&quot; Additional research by Cecily Huang It&apos;s complicated: get-out clauses for the one-child policy Because family planning regulations are set by provincial and municipal authorities, even experts struggle to keep track of the complicated rules. Broadly speaking, rural families whose first child is a girl and ethnic minorities have a right to a second child. Families with a disabled child or couples who are both only children are also entitled to another birth, in recognition of the expectation that children will one day support their elders economically. Divorcees with a child are allowed another if their new spouse does not have one. Some areas allow particular ethnic minorities to have more than two children; others allow fishermen to have a second child under certain conditions, because their work can be difficult and dangerous. Because women traditionally marry into their husbands&apos; families, couples are also allowed to have two children if the woman has no siblings and her husband agrees to help look after her parents. But there are often conditions, for example requiring couples to wait several years before having a second child. Some places impose additional restrictions. This week, the Beijing News detailed some of the complications: in Beijing, rules state that rural families with a daughter can only have a second child if they farm, have lived in a mountainous area for a long time and face &quot;practical difficulties&quot;. Meanwhile, in Ningxia, miners are allowed to apply for a second child even if their first is a boy, as long as they have been working underground for more than five years and will continue doing so. The strictness of enforcement varies dramatically, although families expecting lax supervision can sometimes face sudden crackdowns. One Tibetan woman with more than a dozen siblings, all born since the introduction of family planning restrictions, told the Guardian that her parents had never been fined. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 August 2012.

This means that the password files are unreadable, but players with easily guessable passwords are vulnerable to account theft.

It seems far more likely that these two researchers are the ones who discovered the remote code execution vulnerability in the Developer Center which caused the outage. For researchers who are in this game, the credit from a company is the reward, so they most likely reported it to Apple. Once it had been confirmed, Apple was worried enough to take the Dev Center down to fix the problem.  Fits with what we reported previously: Balic&apos;s claims didn&apos;t fit with his claim to have hacked developer details.

The disaster, caused when the tsunami that followed the devastating earthquake in 2011 knocked out backup generators pumping water to cool the fuel rods, has cost more than $200bn (\u00a3128bn) and is now expected to cost billions more. The human cost, so slow is the impact of radiation, won&apos;t be measurable for a generation. It has profoundly shaken confidence in the future of nuclear power, from Taiwan \u2013 where earlier this month MPs resorted to fisticuffs as they debated a referendum on a new nuclear power station \u2013 to Berlin, and it&apos;s changing the landscape of new nuclear here in Britain. Until Fukushima, the risk of catastrophic meltdown of the sort that occurred first at Chernobyl was supposed to be one in 100,000. But Fukushima occurred almost exactly 25 years after Chernobyl and that slashes the estimate to one in 5,000. In addition, the kind of cascade of devastating events that hit Fukushima hadn&apos;t previously been factored into risk probability assessments. Now regulatory authorities all over the world have been forced to consider whether, however unlikely, more than one accident could happen in quick succession, and what the consequences would be. The whole risk and safety assessment framework is being redesigned. Britain and France are almost the only countries in Europe still determined to expand nuclear (and France is reducing dependence) rather than focus on holding down demand for electricity, but costs are soaring. Earlier this year, Centrica pulled out of a deal with the French-owned EDF, blaming in part redesigns forced by Fukushima. The coalition, which had promised no new subsidies to nuclear power in 2010, is now offering \u00a310bn of financial guarantees to make sure the extra capacity comes on stream, and may offer a hidden subsidy in guaranteed electricity prices. Meanwhile, subsidy-hating George Osborne will be watching the fate of Angela Merkel in next month&apos;s federal elections. Only days after Fukushima, the German chancellor reversed her long-held support for nuclear power and, a year after announcing a 10-year extension, she promised to phase it out by 2022. Two years on, the huge expansion of windpower she promised is behind schedule and electricity bills have risen by 20% to pay for the changeover. German industry is feeling the pain too.

The director of the White House&apos;s Office of Science and Technology Policy, John P Holdren, regularly meets with his science policy counterparts from Brazil, China, India, Japan, Korea and Russia. The US State Department has sent a series of American scientists abroad as &quot;Science Envoys&quot; in hopes of using scientific relationships as an olive branch to the Muslim world. Since 2009, these science envoys, acting as private citizens, have collectively visited almost 20 countries, including Indonesia, Morocco, Bangladesh, Kazahkstan and pre-revolution Egypt. This new interest in science diplomacy is at least partially explained by the nature of contemporary global problems: issues of resource distribution, climate change, and uneven economic growth can only be solved with input from science. Climate change, for instance, does not respect international borders; addressing it will require international partnerships. Nor do American scientists hold a monopoly on good ideas. For these and a host of other reasons, science diplomacy makes good sense and promises benefits for the countries on either end of scientific exchange.  But science diplomacy programmes also draw on a long tradition that holds science and scientists as uniquely qualified to spread American ideals. In the 1960s (the last time that the United States made a sustained effort to use science diplomacy to build international partnerships), the concept was marred by ties to propaganda campaigns and intelligence operations. The idea was that foreign elites who adopted the values of science \u2013 objectivity, internationalism, the free exchange of information \u2013 would be more receptive to American overtures more generally. This assumption drove most US science diplomacy throughout the Cold War.  When government sponsorship was explicit (&quot;overt&quot;), neither intelligence gathering nor pro-American reporting would have come as a surprise: anyone agreeing to participate in a US government-sponsored scientific meeting, circa 1962, probably knew what they were getting into.  Things got much murkier when the foreign policy establishment turned to groups of private citizens as ambassadors for science. An oddity of the history of American diplomacy is that the United States routinely conducted its Cold War cultural campaigns through arms-length arrangements. In a few cases, the groups engaged in so-called &quot;private diplomacy&quot; really were unaffiliated, but \u2013 more often than not \u2013 organisations touting their &quot;independent&quot; work on behalf of the US government received help, usually with financial support channeled through fake philanthropic foundations. The pass-through strategy was common in US international activities from approximately 1948 until 1967, when an article in Ramparts magazine uncovered the CIA&apos;s covert funding of the National Student Association (a youth organisation), and caused a major foreign policy scandal. Science turned out to be a particularly good fit for this sort of arm&apos;s-length operation. All attempts at private diplomacy offered benefits of economy and plausible deniability, but private science diplomacy carried the additional weight of reinforcing American ideals. The American version of &quot;science&quot; that these scientists and their patrons at the CIA had in mind stressed disinterestedness, objectivity and scientist-driven research organisations. They portrayed Soviet science, in contrast, as enslaved to the state, overly focused on technology and driven by ideology. Who better to spread this message than private scientists, working as individuals? By definition, this worldview undermined the ability of overtly sponsored US government science diplomacy to promote the American message.  Consider a specific example. In the early 1960s, the Boulder, Colorado-based Biological Sciences Curriculum Study produced a series of innovative biology textbooks; it&apos;s still around today. In 1961, the BSCS started accepting funds from the Asia Foundation (now known to be a CIA pass-through) for its international programmes. Like many of the private organisations that received at least part of their funding through the CIA, the BSCS also received support from legitimate philanthropic organisations, including the Rockefeller Foundation and US government agencies, including the National Science Foundation. Nor is it entirely clear whether the BSCS&apos;s leaders were aware of the true source of Asia Foundation funds: Arnold Grobman, the BSCS&apos;s long-time executive director, denied any knowledge of such links in an interview with me a few months before his death, in the fall of 2011.  In any case, between 1961 and 1967, the BSCS and its overseas affiliates received 10s of thousands of dollars from the Asia Foundation to underwrite the adaptation and translation of biology textbooks in Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and other nations on the Chinese perimeter. From the historical evidence, the BSCS&apos;s overseas adaptation offices don&apos;t appear to be cover for something nefarious: they really did focus on biology curriculum reform, especially textbook translation. The only thing sketchy about these offices was that their support came from a different source than their local participants (and possibly even their American partners) believed. And that&apos;s the problem. Covers can be blown. When the Asia Foundation&apos;s board of trustees acknowledged their ties to the CIA in 1967 (in an attempt to pre-empt yet another damaging story in Ramparts), the BSCS&apos;s entire overseas operation came under suspicion. Indian authorities, for instance, briefly threatened to kick out any group that received funding from the Asia Foundation; it took the BSCS years to re-establish trust with the foreign ministers of education who had previously embraced their work. A similar fate befell almost all projects that involved Americans abroad, as all &quot;private support&quot; became synonymous with &quot;CIA front&quot;. Covert operations discredited the concept of cultural diplomacy for a generation.  The Obama administration&apos;s resurrection of the concept of science diplomacy offers enormous potential. But, once again, the intelligence establishment has found in science diplomacy a convenient cover for its own needs. The CIA&apos;s use of a fake vaccination campaign in the hunt for Osama bin Laden and the subsequent withdrawal of aid workers from Pakistan over fears for their safety, are all too familiar. Once again, covert operations are threatening to derail genuinely helpful, hopeful activities that might otherwise go a long way toward building international goodwill. The state department&apos;s insistence on calling its science envoys &quot;private citizens&quot;, too, is cause for concern. Since the science envoys are obviously doing the state department&apos;s work, why not call them &quot;officials&quot; and avoid the potential for confusion? The US has been there before. This time, science diplomacy is worth doing right. Audra J. Wolfe is a writer, editor and historian based in Philadelphia.

The two-year lifespan of an iPad &gt;&gt; PC Pro blog Barry Collins on his ailing iPad 2:   I&apos;m not arguing that Apple has misled anyone over the longevity of the iPad, nor that any of the first-generation Android tablets have fared any better. But is two years or so of active service really all people expect from a device costing that much? Certainly, if you&apos;d bought a \u00a3700 Mac two years ago, you&apos;d expect it to be ticking along merrily today. iPads, it seems, are closer to smartphones in longevity than they are PCs. Hardware refresh cycles just started spinning a little faster.  (Thanks #beardyweirdy666 for the link.) Driver-less cars: a $600 billion opportunity &gt;&gt; Digits to Dollars Jay Greenberg:   There is some very compelling math behind this idea. So far, most of the analysis of self-driving cars has focused on the cost of upgrading a vehicle to drive itself. The Journal did an article last year where they calculated that the additional sensors and computers needed for such a vehicle cost about $15,000 to $20,000 per vehicle today. But those figures are for prototypes, and much of the cost is the sensors. When these become mass-produced, the self-driving components will probably end up adding about $5,000 to the cost of a car. Not a big number, but it enough so that this is not an obvious upgrade for everyone\u2026 The average American drives 24 minutes to work every day, or 48 minutes per day. That works out to 206 hours per year per worker. The average American salary [PDF] is $50,054 per year, which equates to roughly $25 per hour. With 119 million Americans driving themselves to work every day, all of this works out to $616 billion per year in time spent commuting to work, or $5,162 per worker. By this math, an extra $5,000 per car to upgrade to self-driving frees up enough time for the upgrades to pay for itself in one year.  Tasty business opportunity. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer&apos;s legacy: a salesman without product vision &gt;&gt; Fast Company Austin Carr:   The problem is that Ballmer was never much of an innovator. A former high-level Microsoft manager describes Ballmer&apos;s approach to product: &quot;It really all boils down to the innovator&apos;s dilemma,&quot; the source explains. &quot;Are you going to have 50 people work on something that&apos;s interesting and that could maybe make $100m in three to four years? Or are you going to use those 50 workers to increase the SQL server sales team, which could generate $1bn in additional revenue in nine months?&quot; Ballmer simply wasn&apos;t a product guy. As top insiders told me not long ago, Ballmer offered no direction on the features and user interface of Windows 8, for example; he never even got together with the team to green-light the redesign. When asked if Ballmer was ever involved in any product decisions, one longtime designer said &quot;no&quot; flat-out. Another added, &quot;Not at all.&quot; As one source said, &quot;I don&apos;t think Steve could even spell the word design.&quot;  Failing to oversee Windows 8 more closely may have been the key failure. Taiwan vendors concerned about the possibility of cheap iPad mini &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Since the hardware development of tablets has almost reached maturity, other than upgrades in hardware specifications such as the processor, industrial design, camera module, panel and touchscreen module, there are not many new surprises tablets can offer to consumers. As a result, the US vendor&apos;s pricing strategy has received more attention from its competitors than the new features it puts out in its latest products. \u2026If Apple decides to keep its new iPad mini priced at around NT$10,500 (US$351) and drop its previous-generation model to around NT$8,500, it could significantly impact all the non-Apple tablet vendors and even change the tablet ecosystem.  Have to love that list of &quot;other than\u2026&quot;. (What about adding Senseg&apos;s haptic technology, eh?) China white-box handsets less popular in emerging markets &gt;&gt; Digitimes  China white-box handsets have seen declined popularity in emerging markets where mobile telecom carriers and retail channels are eager to look for products of better quality, according to Taiwan-based supply chain makers. This is likely to create business opportunities for Taiwan-based handset ODMs. China-based white-box handset vendors had been active in emerging markets including China, Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, the sources indicated. However, as telecom carriers have gained more control and consumers become more brand-conscious amid growing demand for smartphones, China-based white-box handset vendors have seen business decline in Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, the sources noted. Telecom carriers, local vendors and retail channels in those emerging markets are expected to release handset ODM orders, but they tend to avoid China-based suppliers, the sources claimed. Therefore, Taiwan-based ODMs stand a good chance of obtaining such orders.  parallax.js &gt;&gt; Github Fun on desktop (move the mouse) or mobile (tilt the device).

Samsung ATIV Q In danger of being cancelled due to patent issues? &gt;&gt; G4Games Announced two months ago, the Ativ Q would be a tablet running both Windows 8 and Android. However...   According to the Korean press, the reason why we haven&apos;t heard anything new about the ATIV Q is that the manufacturer has run into some serious patent issues related to the dual OS (Windows 8 / Android 4.2) system. According to the same source familiar with Samsung-internal state of affairs, the company is trying its best to overcome the situation but the odds are not looking good right now. It has also been reported that Samsung has canceled all the pre-orders (probably the source means pre-orders made by retailers) and advertisements. We even checked Samsung&apos;s official website, and even though the source code still mentions the ATIV Q in the HTML title tag, the device is nowhere to be seen on the page itself.  Can&apos;t be many companies owning patents relating to running two OSs on a device. Odd if Microsoft is pressuring Samsung not to make a Windows 8 tablet.

Much of the header layout requires WebKit-specific CSS; and that&apos;s CSS that won&apos;t display in other browsers. In fact if you drill down into any Google mobile app, there&apos;s plenty of WebKit specific code all the way through the application. Are the features that Google wants Microsoft to put into its browser those WebKit vendor prefixes? It&apos;s certainly relying on them in many of its web properties \u2013 and that would explain why it wants changes to Internet Explorer, allowing it to simplify the code in its JavaScript libraries and developer kits. It&apos;s tempting to build apps that rely on the latest features, and if they&apos;ll run on most of the devices out there, well, the rest will catch up someday. But that&apos;s a rationale that assumes that the W3C will standardise on those experimental features, and that the resulting CSS and HTML markup will end up in new editions of current browsers quickly.

The man who &apos;got it&apos; too much &gt;&gt; The Kernel Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry argues that conventional narratives have completely missed the point about Microsoft&apos;s outgoing CEO:   Steve Ballmer is the guy who, when it became obvious the iPhone was a success, completely changed Microsoft&apos;s mobile strategy, and got his huge lumbering elephant of a company to deliver excellent software that is anything but a carbon copy of iOS (unlike a certain other mobile operating system of a certain other North California company). He&apos;s a guy who, when he saw how successful software-hardware integration was on mobile devices, built a close partnership with Nokia to deliver the same level of integration, and even experimented with building his own devices, going against 20 years of Microsoft tradition and potentially alienating dozens of partners. Steve Ballmer is the guy who before retiring published\u00a0a public strategic memo defining Microsoft as a &quot;devices and services&quot; company \u2013 for a company that has always rejected those two types of businesses. A memo where the word &quot;software&quot;,\u00a0which has defined Microsoft for 30 years, doesn&apos;t appear even once. \u00a0Steve Ballmer &quot;doesn&apos;t get it&quot;? Puh-leeze.

Google Chromecast first impressions and photos &gt;&gt; SuperSite for Windows Paul Thurrott:   Chromecast isn&apos;t a digital media set-top box. It&apos;s a dumb wireless display dongle. For $15 more you can get a complete, free-standing Roku box that comes with its own remote control. No brainer. Second, as alluded to above, Chromecast is extremely limited. You can stream content from the Google Play Store (music or video), from Netflix, and from YouTube only. By comparison, Roku sports over 750+ channels of entertainment, including all the heavy hitters: Netflix, HBO GO, Vudu, Crackle, Amazon Instant Video, Hulu Plus, MLB.TV Premium, Disney, EPIX, SyFy, NOOK Video, and many, many more. 750 vs. 3.

In defence of the Surface RT &gt;&gt; PC Pro Paul Ockenden:   Don&apos;t get me wrong, I love the Windows desktop, and I think the Windows 8 Start screen is a complete pain in the backside on a &quot;normal&quot; computer. But the desktop simply isn&apos;t suitable for tablets. Manufacturers have tried making a decent Windows-based tablet for years, and they&apos;ve never worked properly. The &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; philosophy of Windows 8 is a mistake, because tablets and desktops/laptops need different user interfaces. There, I&apos;ve said it. Sorry, Microsoft.  Other parts of his &quot;support&quot; include there being fewer apps than iOS/Android, the imperfect interface for Office on a tablet, and that lack of VBA macros. His payoff:   There&apos;s only one little thing that worries me: for the past couple of weeks, the Surface has been sitting on the coffee table in my lounge next to my iPad, and every time I&apos;ve wanted to check Twitter, post a Facebook status update or read my emails, I&apos;ve reached for the latter.

HTC developing own smartphone operating system - WSJ.com Eva Dou:   HTC is developing a mobile software system specifically for Chinese consumers, people familiar with the project say, as part of a big China bet that the Taiwanese smartphone maker hopes will help revive sliding sales. Development of the smartphone operating system is being closely monitored by HTC&apos;s Chairwoman Cher Wang, who has been in discussions with Chinese government officials, said the people. The software involves deep integration with Chinese apps like the Twitter-like microblog Weibo and is slated to launch before the end of the year, they said. \u2026HTC&apos;s China-specific software would play into a wider Chinese government policy to encourage the development of a unique local software ecosystem to reduce reliance on Western companies.

Samsung decreases orders for 10.1-inch tablet components, say Taiwan makers &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Samsung is adopting a strategy to flood the market with various tablets including 7-, 8- and 10in models, as it seeks to dethrone Apple. Samsung shipped about 17m tablets in the first half of 2013 with 7in models accounting for 70% of the shipments. The 7in 8GB Galaxy Tab 2&apos;s US$169 and the new 7in 8GB Galaxy Tab 3&apos;s US$199 price points have both helped boost Samsung&apos;s 7in tablet sales significantly, the sources noted. However, Samsung&apos;s 10.1in tablets have performed weaker than expected. Samsung has recently cut its 10.1in Galaxy Tab 2&apos;s price to US$319 in North America and is selling its 10.1in Galaxy Tab 3 for US$379 and Galaxy Note for US$449, but the tablets have not been selling as well as expected despite the fact their prices are more attractive than Apple&apos;s 9.7in iPad 4.

In research, this is known as confirmation bias, and it&apos;s a very hard thing to overcome, even when you are aware of it. So, if you really want to understand what&apos;s going on with a category as complex as the one we operate in, you&apos;ve got your work cut out for you. In that spirit, there have been a few common themes in some of the coverage I&apos;ve seen since Friday that are worth taking a moment to dissect and discuss. One approach has been to focus exclusively on some of our consumer businesses, and then judge us harshly while ignoring the successes we&apos;ve had elsewhere. Another approach has been to go a step further, criticize our lack of &quot;focus&quot; and suggest that those other successes are actually a distraction from what they believe should be our single priority. What these themes reveal is a single narrow frame through which the writers and pundits view the industry itself that leads them to reach these conclusions.

Apple has not indicated whether it is working on the device, but the possibility of an &quot;iWatch&quot; has been the subject of growing speculation since reports surfaced earlier this year that Apple had a team working on a &quot;wearable computing&quot; product \u2013 a field that chief executive Tim Cook called &quot;profoundly interesting&quot;. A smart watch could connect to a user&apos;s phone and provide updates or information without needing them to consult their phone directly. In the US, Pebble Technology has already sold 85,000 of its Pebble watches at $150, after a crowdfunding campaign raised more than $10m. Apple&apos;s interest was noted after it filed for an &quot;iWatch&quot; trademark in Japan in July, and more recently hired a Nike executive for an undisclosed post. An &quot;iWatch&quot; would probably be unveiled early in 2014 to assess the broader market \u2013 but will be playing catch-up against rivals including Samsung, which is preparing to unveil its own &quot;Gear&quot; watch device on 4 September at the IFA event in Berlin, and Google, which is expected to put its head-worn &quot;Glass&quot; product into commercial production during 2014, having already begun &quot;Explorer&quot; trials with thousands of users in July. Price and functionality would be key questions for Apple to solve. Angela McIntyre of the research group Gartner told the Guardian that she thought it might be priced between $149 and $199: &quot;That&apos;s within the price range of a nice holiday gift for a husband or wife. Apple products are typically priced somewhat more than competing devices, and people who pay a premium for the Apple brand expect better quality and design.&quot; She added: &quot;If Apple ships more than 63m units the year after launch, iWatch would ramp faster than iPhone, iPad or iPod, which seems unlikely. If Apple gets the iWatch right, it could become the top selling smartwatch.&quot; Apple said it did not comment on rumours or speculation.

The names of Chery, Xiaomi and Baidu are synonymous with cars, mobile phones and internet search in China but they do not resonate abroad in the way that Ford, Samsung and Google straddle the globe. Likewise, there is no Chinese equivalent of Sony, Boeing or Coca-Cola, despite the ambition of the political hierarchy to convert a nation of 1.3bn people into a consumption-driven juggernaut. That lack of a worldwide champion means that Made in China lacks prestige as a label, despite the country&apos;s importance as the world&apos;s factory floor, making everything from iPads to Topshop garments. And that reputation as a global manufacturing hub is one of the problems, nurturing a perception that China is synonymous with cheap, low-quality goods. Newspaper headlines in the west declaim stories about China&apos;s toxic baby milk, lead-contaminated toys and fake pharmaceuticals. But this is changing, as China&apos;s leaders force that economic shift from export-based growth to consumer spending. They are pumping money into research and development so that Chinese brands can compete with foreign rivals in a burgeoning domestic market. Furthermore, many of these companies have taken that baton and are running towards foreign markets, with the hope that global success will result. Much of the push comes in the form of state subsidies \u2013 according to the state-run China Daily newspaper, the country spent \u00a3105bn on research and development last year. A number of Chinese companies have delivered high-quality products abroad, mainly through combining with other international conglomerates. For example, computer maker Lenovo bought IBM&apos;s PC division in 2005 and five years later Geely Automobile bought Volvo from Ford. But analysts say China&apos;s quest to deliver a global brand, while fuelled by an abundance of cash and ambition, may face insurmountable obstacles such as a rigid corporate culture and a top-down approach to innovation. The draconian education system encourages rote memorisation over creativity, while its political system discourages risk-taking and going against the grain. &quot;There&apos;s a conflict of interest that China has \u2013 one which supports as well as deters innovation \u2013 and that is central government control,&quot; says Bill Dodson, the Shanghai-based author of China Fast Forward: The Technologies, Green Industries and Innovations Driving the Mainland&apos;s Future. He adds: &quot;China says OK, we&apos;re going to identify 20 companies to go out and become global brand champions, and we&apos;re going to give them whatever money and resources they need to do that. But if the companies become too big for their britches, or snap back at central government, or become too autonomous, there&apos;s a reining in.&quot; Analysts point to Japan and South Korea&apos;s success in developing global brands as evidence that China could soon follow. Before the 1980s, Japan&apos;s manufacturing base endured the same derision as China&apos;s, but that was before brands such as Sony, Nissan, Toyota and Honda established themselves globally. South Korea&apos;s capital, Seoul, was once reliant on foreign aid to overcome the devastation of the Korean war. It is now one of the world&apos;s most technologically advanced urban centres. Samsung, founded more than 70 years ago as a trading company, is now one of South Korea&apos;s two most successful conglomerates. Its subsidiaries deal in everything from theme parks to life insurance. Taken as a whole, it produces a fifth of the country&apos;s global exports. Its other global superpower, Hyundai, was founded in 1947 as a construction firm and began exporting cars to the US in the 1980s. This month, it unveiled a \u00a331,000 concept car, the HCD-14 Genesis, which it hopes will take on the world&apos;s top brands. Among China&apos;s biggest hopes for a global breakthrough is car maker Chery, founded in 1997. Its most popular model is the QQ City Car, a pod-like hatchback that seems ubiquitous among China&apos;s middle-class families. The company has established joint ventures with a number of foreign brands, including Jaguar Land Rover and in 2011 it exported around a quarter of its production total. Yet Chery has yet to create an image that will turn heads in New York and London. &quot;While Chery is enhancing its hard power actively, it also pays close attention to fostering soft power,&quot; boasts the company&apos;s English website, taking a cue from the country&apos;s diplomatic rhetoric. &quot;With vigorous culture of innovation, Chery has realised the great-leap-forward development and has received deep concern and great attention from the leaders of the country and the Party.&quot; Sceptics say that Chinese brands like Chery will never surpass foreign rivals unless they can embrace fundamental principles of innovation \u2013 open communication, risk-taking \u2013 that require more than cash. This extends to creative industries, such as music, film, and fashion. &quot;We get these endless things from the government saying there should be more innovation and brand building,&quot; says Paul French, chief China market strategist at market research firm Mintel. &quot;But there isn&apos;t anything behind it. The problem is that no one really wants to invest in innovative design. It&apos;s very market-led. So if reports come to the stores that red shirts are selling, they&apos;ll tell their in-house designers to design more red shirts. This means the designers don&apos;t get a chance to do anything.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t think anyone in government understands creative industries,&quot; French adds. &quot;They spent 60 years driving creativity out of the system. To reintroduce it in 10 minutes is a bit hopeful.&quot; Chinese companies are trying to buck that trend. For instance, Huawei, the world&apos;s largest telecoms equipment maker, headquartered in Shenzhen, has more than 140,000 employees, nearly half of whom work in R&amp;D. The company applied for 54,000 patents in 2012, 14,000 of them outside China. However, Chinese technology upstarts will struggle to make inroads into western markets, judging by Huawei&apos;s sometimes faltering progress, because of the political problems they face. Huawei has been barred from operating in the US because of security concerns and its UK operations are the subject of a review by Britain&apos;s national security adviser, Sir Kim Darroch. Robin Li, boss of Baidu, China&apos;s leading search engine, announced a plan to crack the Japanese market in 2007. Last year, when diplomatic tempers flared amid a territorial dispute over a series of islands in the resource-rich East China Sea, Baidu&apos;s main page displayed a cartoon illustration of the islands beneath an oversized Chinese flag. Japanese consumers were incensed. The company has lost more than \u00a360m on the project. WeChat, a smartphone instant messaging app similar to WhatsApp in the US, has taken off in south-east Asia and recently launched an advertising campaign in India featuring Bollywood stars. WeChat has a leg up on its competitors because of its easy-to-use interface and sophisticated integration of features: it combines an Instagram-like photo-sharing tool, a voice-messaging service, and an array of social functions designed for meeting strangers. Yet in January, users discovered that sending politically sensitive terms across international borders returned the words &quot;the message you sent contains restricted words. Please check it again.&quot; WeChat developer Tencent called the incident a &quot;glitch&quot;. &quot;In terms of China&apos;s consumer internet, more than any cultural factors, the biggest barrier would be the regulations and protectionism surrounding the internet,&quot; says Kai Lukoff, co-founder of TechRice, a blog about China&apos;s tech sector. &quot;You have this iron curtain 2.0 that separates the internet culture in China from that of the rest of the world. So \u2026 when Chinese companies go abroad, they feel woefully out of place.&quot; Yet that has not stopped them from trying. This week, popular smartphone maker Xiaomi pulled off a coup by hiring Google&apos;s former vice-president for Android product management, Hugo Barra, to help it expand its global presence. The two-year-old company has established a reputation for producing high-quality, low-cost Android phones. The low-cost smartphone market is drawing Apple&apos;s interest, but Xiaomi is ahead, having already expanded to Hong Kong and Taiwan. Experts say Chinese companies in newer industries such as smartphones stand a better chance of gaining traction abroad. &quot;In western markets we have all these legacies, the infrastructure, built in: the desktop PC, the landline, the fax. In China, they could just leap ahead to the latest and greatest,&quot; says Rebecca Fannin, the author of Silicon Dragon: How China is Winning the Tech Race. Chinese companies have gone to great lengths to avoid the stigma associated with their country&apos;s brands. &quot;They produce a lot of stuff which western people like and use, they&apos;re just not under a Chinese brand name,&quot; says Sam Lipoff, a doctoral student at Harvard Business School who researches innovation in China. Domestic conglomerates often acquire foreign brands, and encourage them to maintain their native identities. Some of these deals have been extremely ambitious, such as the acquisition of British yacht maker Sunseeker by the Dalian Wanda conglomerate. Herborist, a Chinese cosmetics firm, has taken a different tack, marketing its products internationally as &quot;made in Shanghai&quot;, evoking images of bustle and grandeur, rather than dark industrial-belt factories. &quot;This begs the question: what makes a company Chinese?&quot; Lipoff says. &quot;That its workers are in China? Or its offices? Or it sells to Chinese customers? Or has a Chinese name? This is an important thing to think about.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/02/phablets-asia-pacific-tablets-laptops-growth", "publicationDate": "2013-09-02T06:58:22Z", "tags": ["Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Technology", "Software", "Samsung", "Apple", "Phablets"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s HTC has also followed with its own &quot;Butterfly&quot; model."], "title": "Phablets are big in Asia-Pacific, equalling tablets and laptops combined", "article": "&quot;Phablets&quot;, the large-screened phones with screen sizes of between 5in and 7in diagonally, sold as well as tablets and laptops combined in the Asia-Pacific region during the second quarter, says research company IDC. The news indicates that the smartphone business has created a new category lying between the standard smartphone and the tablet, first mapped out by Dell with its Streak phone in June 2010, but subsequently capitalised on by Samsung with its Galaxy Note and successors. A total of 25.2m &quot;phablets&quot; shipped in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan), compared to 12.6m tablets (over 7in) and 12.7m portable PCs, IDC said. Phablet shipments have grown dramatically - doubling between the first and second quarter, and rising sixfold compared to the same time last year. However Samsung&apos;s principal rival in the smartphone space, Apple, is unlikely to be able to capitalise on the popularity of phablets this year. Its new iPhones, expected to be unveiled this month, will be using the same 4in screen seen in last year&apos;s iPhone 5, according to leaks from the supply chain over the past few months. That suggests that it would not be able to introduce a &quot;phablet&quot;-style device before 2014 - even if it wants to. Analysts had foreseen the potential for 2013 to be &quot;the year of the phablet&quot; in January, after noting the rapid rise of the large-screened phones in 2012. That month saw China&apos;s Huawei and ZTE both launch their own versions at the Consumer Electronics Show. Taiwan&apos;s HTC has also followed with its own &quot;Butterfly&quot; model. Samsung more recently staked out the top end of the phablet space with its 6.3in Galaxy Mega, unveiled in April. &quot;Users have realised that a nearly 5-inch screen isn&apos;t such a cumbersome device,&quot; said Joshua Flood of ABI Research in January, and forecast then that countries such as Japan and South Korea, and then India, China and Malaysia, would be major markets for the larger devices. Neil Mawston of Strategy Analytics was more straightforward: &quot;We expect 2013 to be the year of the phablet,&quot; he said in January. Flood&apos;s forecast has been borne out, with phablets accounting for 30% of all smartphone sales in India. The key beneficiary is Samsung, whose Galaxy Note range - due to be enhanced this week with the Note 3 on Wednesday - had nearly 50% of the market. But it has had to fight off rivals which have jumped onto the bandwagon. At its launch at the end of 2011, the Note had 90% of the much smaller phablet space.  Their popularity points to a regional preference for larger screens which can be used to carry out work on the go, rather than separate functions to a smaller smartphone and larger tablet. The Asia/Pacific region, and especially China, are seen as a key battleground for the smartphone business as western markets such as North America and Europe move past the early burst of adoption, and sales growth there slows down. By contrast countries such as China, India and others are seeing rapid uptake. &quot;Phablets first started as a trend driven by mature markets like South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore \u2013 and these markets continue to rise,&quot; said Melissa Chau, senior research manager for IDC&apos;s Asia/Pacific client device team. &quot;What&apos;s changed now is the added pick up of phablets in emerging markets like China and India, not just the plethora of big-name vendors competing head-to-head with Samsung, but instead the low-cost local players who have swooped in to offer big screens for less money \u2013 averaging a retail price of US$220 versus Samsung&apos;s US$557.&quot;  Dell lost out by being too early to the market with the Streak, introducing it at a time when most users had smaller phones with screens under 4in diagonally. But the rise in smartphone penetration, and the shift to more data-centric uses such as maps, has made big screens popular - particularly in countries where the device needs to serve multiple computing needs. ."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/sep/02/smart-watch-apple-samsung-google-microsoft", "publicationDate": "2013-09-02T14:49:00Z", "tags": ["Wearable technology", "Technology", "Smartphones", "Smartwatches"], "sentences": ["In August, reports in Taiwan claimed that two local companies, Quanta and Inventec, had won the contracts to build Apple&apos;s first smartwatch, with suggestions that they could build up to 38m units in 2014 \u2013\u00a0although CIMB Securities analyst Wanli Wang predicted 63m units shipping in the first year after the device launched."], "title": "Smart watches: what are Apple, Samsung, Google and Microsoft up to?", "article": "&quot;The wrist is interesting,&quot; said Apple chief executive Tim Cook at the All Things Digital D11 conference in May 2013, when being quizzed about his company&apos;s potential plans for wearable technology in the years to come. &quot;For something to work here you have to convince people it&apos;s so incredible, that they want to wear it... If we had a room full of 10 to 20-year-olds and we said, &apos;Everyone stand up that has a watch,&apos; I&apos;m not sure anybody would stand up.&quot; Nevertheless, Apple is one of the technology giants at the centre of growing speculation about smartwatches. Along with Samsung \u2013\u00a0whose Galaxy Gear is expected to be unveiled later this week \u2013\u00a0Google and Microsoft, the wrist is proving interesting for anyone who&apos;s anyone in the smartphone world. Research firm Canalys recently claimed that 500,000 smartwatches will be sold this year, but then 5m in 2014 thanks to the entry of Apple, Samsung, Google and other technology firms into the market, alongside traditional watch-makers.  Rival IDC even thinks that demand for wearables (including watches) could slow down tablet sales over the coming years, reducing its forecasts accordingly. So what do we know \u2013 or, to be more accurate, what&apos;s been rumoured \u2013 about the plans of the big tech firms? Apple Apple has been rumoured to be making a smartwatch for some time now \u2013\u00a0it&apos;s a perennial rumour alongside an Apple television, hence those questions for Cook. Apple&apos;s registration of iWatch as a trademark in Japan in June this year only fanned the flames of that speculation. That came after a New York Times report claiming that the company had been &quot;experimenting with wristwatch-like devices made of curved glass&quot; and running iOS software. Past employees have been speculating too: interface expert Bruce Tognazzini claimed the &quot;iWatch&quot; would &quot;fill a gaping hole in the Apple ecosystem. It will facilitate and coordinate not only the activities of all the other computers and devices we use, but a wide array of devices to come&quot;. Fellow ex-Appler Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e provided his own opinions back in March, suggesting that &quot;the iWatch will enrich the iOS ecosystem: Reasonably useful on its own, but most important as a way to increase the value/enjoyment of other iDevices\u2026 at least for now.&quot; In July, reports suggested that Apple had made a number of &quot;acqui-hires&quot; of small companies to build its &quot;iWatch&quot; team, sitting within a wider wearables group at the company. The Financial Times claimed that Apple had been forced to turn to outsiders to help with &quot;hard engineering problems that they&apos;ve not been able to solve&quot; in-house. In August, reports in Taiwan claimed that two local companies, Quanta and Inventec, had won the contracts to build Apple&apos;s first smartwatch, with suggestions that they could build up to 38m units in 2014 \u2013\u00a0although CIMB Securities analyst Wanli Wang predicted 63m units shipping in the first year after the device launched. Samsung Plenty of details have leaked out about Samsung&apos;s smartwatch plans: it&apos;s expected to be called the Galaxy Gear, and will be unveiled on 4 September ahead of the IFA consumer electronics trade show in Berlin. Last weekend, VentureBeat claimed a scoop: actual pictures of the Galaxy Gear, although the description \u2013\u00a0&quot;a blocky health tracker with a camera&quot; \u2013\u00a0didn&apos;t exactly whet the appetite. The emphasis was firmly on fitness though: &quot;My initial impression was that it&apos;s a new wearable fitness device to rival a Nike Fuelband or Fitbit Flex \u2014 a smartphone companion rather than a smartphone alternative,&quot; wrote journalist Christina Farr. Separately, shots of Samsung&apos;s app for controlling the watch have also leaked, via the @evleaks Twitter account. The expectation: a device designed as a companion to Samsung&apos;s Galaxy range of Android smartphones. As with other companies mentioned here, the inspiration is thought to be as much fitness-tracking bands by the likes of Jawbone, Nike and Fitbit rather than trying to squeeze a smartphone&apos;s guts into a watch-shaped device. Google It&apos;s just emerged that Google quietly bought a smartwatch startup called Wimm Labs in 2012: the company had released its own WIMM One smartwatch in 2011 before shutting down in 2012 due to &quot;an exclusive, confidential relationship for our technology&quot;. Google. WIMM had been trying to build a platform for developers rather than just a device, although within Google it&apos;s now part of an even bigger platform and developer community: Android. Yet the other interesting thing about the WIMM One was its ability to work as a standalone gadget with its own apps, rather than simply controlling apps on a paired smartphone. News of the acquisition made previous Google smartwatch rumours worth a second reading. The Financial Times reported in March, for example, that Google was working on a smartwatch project within its Android unit, and cited a patent application by the company from 2011 for a &quot;smart-watch&quot; including a &quot;tactile user interface&quot;. The Wall Street Journal followed that up in June with claims that a smartwatch was being developed alongside a games console, both powered by Android, as Google moved more into hardware. There was a hint that the two devices may be in competition in terms of securing a commercial release: &quot;The Internet giant hopes to design and market the devices itself and release at least one of them this fall,&quot; as journalist Amir Efrati put it. Microsoft Microsoft and smartwatches? There&apos;s some history behind that: the company&apos;s SPOT platform tempted the likes of Fossil, Suunto, Swatch and Tissot when its first watches launched in 2004, but by 2008 it was toast, filed alongside Tablet PC in the company&apos;s possibly-too-soon filing cabinet. And in 2013? Suppliers to Microsoft told the Wall Street Journal in April that the company was sourcing components for a smartwatch prototype, including 1.5-inch displays.  In July, The Verge followed up, suggesting that devices were now being prototyped &quot;directly under the Surface team as the firm moves its wrist-worn device closer to reality&quot;. The trouble with all Microsoft rumours right now, however, is that with chief executive Steve Ballmer on the way out, it&apos;s unclear what his replacement&apos;s strategy will be regarding schemes at the prototype stage. And the rest? Pebble Technology has sold more than 85,000 of its Pebble watches since raising $10.3m to make them on Kickstarter. Sony is already on its second device, the SmartWatch 2, which went on sale earlier this year. High-end smartwatch the Hyetis Crossbow has sold more than 300 units \u2013\u00a0and that&apos;s at $1,200 per device. Intel is also testing some smartwatch devices in its labs. &quot;The watch is kind of \u2014 if you want to put the time on it, that&apos;s fine,&quot; chief technology officer Justin Rattner told a Bloomberg conference in June 2013. &quot;But if you&apos;re talking about texting today, wouldn&apos;t it be nice if you could just look at your wrist?&quot; &quot;Almost every major consumer electronics manufacturer is now working on a smartwatch&quot; noted Quartz in July 2013. And that&apos;s not to mention the traditional watch manufacturers. &quot;Suddenly, everyone&apos;s discovered the wrist,&quot; Casio&apos;s chief executive Kazuo Kashio told the New York Times in August. &quot;We&apos;ve known for a long time it&apos;s prime real estate. We&apos;re prepared.&quot; What does this all mean? How much of the excitement about smartwatches is due to the desire within the technology industry (yes, including journalists) for a new category-shaking range of devices, rather than actual demand from buyers or a strong sense of why these smartwatches would be useful? &quot;Smartwatches are a great idea \u2013\u00a0except for the &apos;smart&apos; and &apos;watch&apos; parts,&quot; noted Time&apos;s Harry McCracken in June. He went on to outline the barriers: battery life, display quality and &quot;no true killer apps&quot; \u2013\u00a0although he admitted that fitness-tracking gadgets may offer the most interesting path forward. Even so, the interest in the future of the wrist \u2013 from Tim Cook and his fiercest rivals&apos; companies \u2013 is genuine, as are the questions around the category&apos;s future. Will these devices be more wrist-worn controllers for smartphones (and other devices) than running their own apps? Will they kill off the fitness-tracking bands, or provide the companies making those like Jawbone, Fitbit and Nike with a new product category to move into? Those questions won&apos;t be answered until 2014 at the earliest, whenever the Galaxy Gear goes on sale."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/sep/05/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2013-09-05T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "sentences": ["Before getting caught, the furthest that Chien got to was setting up his Xiaoyu (meaning &quot;little jade&quot;) mobile phone design firm in Taiwan, as well as Yu (&quot;jade&quot;) in mainland China ahead of collaborating with the Chengdu government.", "Selling secrets from a Taiwanese company to a Chinese mainland organisation would mark an enormous betrayal, if proven.", "Orders for 2nd-generation Nexus 7 for 4Q13 may shrink sequentially, say Taiwan makers &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Component makers in the Nexus 7 supply chain are worried they may see a large decrease in orders from Google and Asustek Computer in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to lower-than-expected sales during the third quarter, according to industry sources."], "title": "Boot up: Gear hands-on, Topsy's growth, airports track passengers, and more", "article": "A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team If Google could search Twitter, it would find Topsy &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com  On Wednesday, the San Francisco company [Topsy] announced that it has now indexed every Twitter message since the first tweet was posted in 2006 \u2014 about 425bn pieces of content when you include photos, pages linked from Twitter, and other related material.

HTC&apos;s ex-lead designer may have leaked info to China&apos;s Chengdu government &gt;&gt; Engadget Richard Lai:   The alleged offer was that if [Thomas] Chien [HTC&apos;s ex-VP of product design] left HTC with some of the technology plus some money, then the municipal government would - through another company it set up - take care of the remaining costs for opening the factory, production and marketing. Previous reports say while still at HTC, the ex-exec had e-mailed some confidential Sense 6.0 files to external contacts, but there&apos;s no confirmation on whether those people are linked to the Chengdu government. Before getting caught, the furthest that Chien got to was setting up his Xiaoyu (meaning &quot;little jade&quot;) mobile phone design firm in Taiwan, as well as Yu (&quot;jade&quot;) in mainland China ahead of collaborating with the Chengdu government. Chien and his two accomplices - ex-R&amp;D director Wu Chien-hung and ex-design team senior manager Justin Huang - also used an external design firm to invoice HTC NT$20 million (about US$668,000, and twice as much as previously reported) between May and July for the One&apos;s design, when in fact the project was all done in-house.  Selling secrets from a Taiwanese company to a Chinese mainland organisation would mark an enormous betrayal, if proven. Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Gear is a smartwatch like no other &gt;&gt; The Verge Vlad Savov:   There are a couple of significant downsides that temper my enthusiasm for the new Gear. First and foremost is the speed and intuitiveness of the user interface \u2014 or rather, the lack thereof. There&apos;s a tangible lag to anything you do with the Gear, while the swipe gestures are hard to figure out and do different things depending on where you are in the menus. Additionally, the speaker built into the buckle is too quiet and makes the old sci-fi action of conducting a phone call via your watch a possibility only in quiet areas; it also doesn&apos;t play back any music, it just controls output on your connected device. Most of all, however, I find it hard to justify spending the $299 asking price on an accessory like the Galaxy Gear. It&apos;s too dependent on its parent device for functionality \u2014 which will cost you a fair amount too \u2014 and, like all other smartwatches, fails to truly live up to the &quot;smart&quot; part of its name. Also important will be the Galaxy Gear&apos;s battery life. It does use the Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy standard to communicate, but at 315mAh its battery is decidedly small. Samsung promises &quot;about a day&quot; of endurance from the Gear, but by the end of our briefing with the company, the cameras on most of its demo units were refusing to turn on due to the watches running low on power.  &quot;About 10 hours&quot; may be generous, then. BlackBerry has &apos;one foot in the grave&apos;: AirWatch CEO &gt;&gt; CIO  BlackBerry slipped when it forced businesses to buy its mobile device management (MDM) platform to fully support BlackBerry 10 devices, according to AirWatch CEO John Marshall. &quot;It&apos;s one foot on the banana peel, one foot in the grave,&quot; Marshall told Computerworld Australia this week at the AirWatch Connect conference in Melbourne. BlackBerry&apos;s latest version of its mobile management software, BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) 10, supports Apple and Android devices. However, the company has not allowed multiple-OS MDMs like AirWatch to support BlackBerry devices \u2014 a move that has essentially forced businesses to buy BES if they want to securely support BlackBerry. &quot;By not opening up the APIs a year and a half ago with [BlackBerry] OS 10, it was the beginning of the end,&quot; he said.  AirWatch is a (highly rated) rival to BlackBerry in MDM, but his point is a strong one: it means enterprises using AirWatch wouldn&apos;t buy BB10 phones. (Via @mbrit on Twitter.) Why airports are tracking your smartphone use while you wait for flights &gt;&gt; Skift  The input will help to shorten [passenger] wait times, for one thing. And in the cases of airports like Copenhagen, which\u00a0offers an app it developed in concert with its tracking program, the data will\u00a0give travelers useful information about their own trips. WIth advance notice that security waits are extra long, for instance, a flyer can make the decision to forego a pre-flight coffee in favor of hustling to get in line. Perhaps most important to airports&apos; financial interests, the results of passenger tracking will reveal where and how airport customers spend money amid the multi-billion dollar industry of airport concessions.  Orders for 2nd-generation Nexus 7 for 4Q13 may shrink sequentially, say Taiwan makers &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Component makers in the Nexus 7 supply chain are worried they may see a large decrease in orders from Google and Asustek Computer in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to lower-than-expected sales during the third quarter, according to industry sources.

Finance  The Japanese electronics company, which has suffered $15bn in losses over its latest two financial years, is staking its turnaround on a transformation from a consumer gadget maker to a supplier for other businesses. The architect of this turnaround plan, Panasonic President Kazuhiro Tsuga, has warned he would weed out any division that fails to meet a 5% operating margin goal within three years. Tsuga told Reuters in an interview that the company&apos;s mobile division was likely to lose more than the 1.1bn yen ($11.02m) targeted loss for the financial year ending next March. Panasonic&apos;s mobile division posted an 8.1bn yen loss last year.  In 2001, it was the second-largest handset maker in Japan. Now? It&apos;s all Apple and Samsung.

Meal for two: \u00a340-\u00a360 It began with a craving and ended with garlic breath so powerful it could have floored the cat. I&apos;m not apologising \u2013 I&apos;ve never much liked my cat. Here&apos;s what happened: earlier this summer I went to Yank Sing, a huge Chinese restaurant in San Francisco so highly regarded for its dim sum that on Sunday lunchtimes it feels like half the city is queuing for tables. By far the best thing we ate were the xiao long bao, the famed Shanghainese soupy dumplings, the silky skins holding a\u00a0bolus of minced pork surrounded by hot broth. God knows how they&apos;re made \u2013 cold when the broth is a solid jelly? \u2013 but they are one of the most powerfully comforting food items ever devised by this or any other species. Back in London I wanted them again. I called my friend David Coulter, a musician who survived seven years in the Pogues. Every restaurant critic needs a musician among their circle. They tour a lot, get bored and hungry, and end up knowing where to find the good stuff. &quot;Go to Leong&apos;s Legend in Chinatown,&quot; he said. &quot;Plus, they do those pork buns that David Chang flogs for big bucks in New York.&quot; Ah yes: slices of long-braised pork belly stuffed inside soft fluffy steamed buns, with greenery and sauce. Chang, who is New York&apos;s Asian answer to Gordon Ramsay, only without the people skills, has built a career flogging them. Yum Buns, the street-food outfit which now has a permanent base near Farringdon, has also lovingly ripped them off for London. I didn&apos;t know you could get them at Leong&apos;s Legend, too. A few weeks ago I said the pleasing but nose-bleedingly expensive food at Hutong in the Shard was available in other places at a fraction of the cost and without the view. Leong&apos;s Legend, which specialises in the genre-crossing food of Taiwan, is one of them. It barely has windows, let alone a view. It&apos;s all teahouse hardwood stools and bare tables; the waitresses don&apos;t so much provide service as carry stuff while gossiping over each other&apos;s phones. All to the good. It makes the food the star.     'Pouches of loveliness': xiao long bao.

The skins aren&apos;t quite as delicate as those in San Francisco, but not far off. The challenge is to eat them at the right temperature. If they cool they&apos;ll stick to the steamer&apos;s greaseproof paper then tear when you pick them up and leak the stock. That would never do. Eat them too hot and you&apos;ll scorch your tongue. David&apos;s smart ruse was to pluck them out \u2013 by hand; you&apos;ll perforate them with chopsticks \u2013 and cool them in the saucer of dark vinegar with its julienne of fresh ginger. They are a\u00a0truly absorbing eating experience. The pork buns are listed as Taiwanese mini kebabs and are the most fun you can have in Chinatown for \u00a33.30. Stuffed inside the neutral pillow of bun are tangles of pig plus fronds of coriander, the crunch of peanut and a little sugar. Gosh. The menu offers many things designed to scare the children \u2013 spicy pork intestines with crispy skins, anyone? \u2013 but also the ripe promise of a\u00a0fresh oyster omelette: sweet salty molluscs and spring onion enclosed in an eggy blanket with a dribble of sweet-sour sauce. And then the cat-flooring dish of stir-fried chilli crab, Wind Shelter Bay style. Apparently in Wind Shelter Bay they like to fry their crab and cover it with dunes of deep-fried minced garlic, spring onions and red chillies with a little sugar and (not too much) salt. I\u00a0picked meat from the shells by hand, until my fingertips were salty and sticky, and finished up by spooning the unmissable fried garlic into my mouth, unable to let it go. And then back home I breathed on the cat, and I&apos;m absolutely certain it winced. Leong&apos;s Legend is exactly what we all need now and then: a\u00a0place that satisfies a basic need."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/sep/11/top-travel-websites-opentrips-tripobox", "publicationDate": "2013-09-11T12:21:00Z", "tags": ["Travel websites", "Travel"], "sentences": ["Other trips currently on the cards include a trip to write a collaborative cookbook in Italy and \u2013 still in its early planning stages \u2013 a food tour of Taiwan led by Bao London, who have won awards for their Taiwanese street food in the UK."], "title": "Top travel websites: OpenTrips.co.uk", "article": "Have you ever looked at a holiday company&apos;s itinerary and wished you could modify it? A few destination swaps here, an extra day there \u2026 and how about making sure all activities are linked to your own personal interests? That&apos;s what OpenTrips.co.uk is trying to facilitate. Instead of letting a travel company dictate an agenda based on what will sell, it allows individuals to suggest their own group trip and invite others \u2013 friends or strangers with shared interests \u2013 to join them. Those invitees are then allowed to join in the trip planning, suggesting and voting for possible excursions, and once everyone is happy with the plan, it is handed back to the OpenTrips team, who will collaborate with a range of their contacts in the travel industry to price it up and make it a bookable trip. So far trips have sold out, including a food tour of north-east Hungary (16 people signed up at \u00a3425 a head for four nights, including all accommodation and meals, hunting and fishing trips, foraging and sausage-making). Other trips currently on the cards include a trip to write a collaborative cookbook in Italy and \u2013 still in its early planning stages \u2013 a food tour of Taiwan led by Bao London, who have won awards for their Taiwanese street food in the UK. &quot;Friends don&apos;t necessarily make the best travel companions,&quot; says founder Florian Siepert. That can be true, but the site is not aimed entirely at solo travellers and people can sign up with friends or partners. Established tour companies can also post a trip idea and allow travellers to select its components. It&apos;s a great idea, but the site is still finding its feet and only time will tell if it can gather enough momentum to propel it forward. Another site worth bookmarking For those who want to travel only with people they know, there&apos;s Tripobox.com. Instead of countless pre-trip emails and phone calls between group members, you can set up a trip itinerary here, a little like a online pinboard, and allow friends to pick from a selected assortment of hotels, restaurants and activities. The companies involved have either approached Tripobox or been specifically selected, and Tripobox receives commission on any bookings. The current mix counterbalances a few bland inclusions (the Ibis in King&apos;s Cross) with some more interesting partnerships, including supper club site Eatwith.com. A nice touch is that payments can be split equally between all participants in the group trip, which saves the hassle of having one person take the hit and then have to chase everyone for the cash later. The site currently only covers a handful of destinations (including Barcelona, Berlin, New York and Paris), but it looks set to expand. After a $200,000 initial investment, the founders are now looking for more funding to grow."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/china-panda-gift-belgium", "publicationDate": "2013-09-12T12:10:19Z", "tags": ["Belgium", "Europe", "China", "World news"], "sentences": ["The giant panda has long been used as a diplomatic peace offering in international relations, from Mao Zedong&apos;s gift of a pair to the US in 1972 after Richard Nixon&apos;s historic visit, to Beijing&apos;s offering to Taiwan in 2008."], "title": "China's panda gift aggravates Belgian tensions", "article": "The giant panda has long been used as a diplomatic peace offering in international relations, from Mao Zedong&apos;s gift of a pair to the US in 1972 after Richard Nixon&apos;s historic visit, to Beijing&apos;s offering to Taiwan in 2008.

Between June of 1995 until April of 2001, a span of 455 Indians home dates, every seat in Jacob&apos;s Field (now Progressive Field) was either filled or paid for. Their sellout streak was an extraordinary achievement for a franchise which had flirted with the idea of moving to New Orleans in the early 1970s, whose losing ways were immortalized in the late 1980s film Major League. Their winning-starved fans came to watch Jim Thome, Kenny Lofton, Roberto Alomar, Manny Ramirez, Albert Belle and Omar Vizquel, the core of a ballclub that racked up two American League pennants and six playoff appearances in seven seasons. Since then, the Tribe, who haven&apos;t won a World Series title since 1948, have made the playoffs just once.  And so you would think that with their Indians back in the thick of the playoff race for the first September in six seasons, fans would respond by coming out to watch, but that&apos;s not the case in Cleveland, where sparse crowds watch manager Terry Francona&apos;s revived ballclub. In baseball, the formula has almost always been win and they&apos;ll come in, but in Cleveland, the Indians are winning and few are coming. There are exceptions - the Rays have struggled with attendance despite competing for playoff spots since 2008, the A&apos;s are working towards their second consecutive American League West title, 11th of 15 AL teams in attendance. This season the Indians are just behind Tampa in the race for the second wildcard spot and just ahead of them in attendance, 14th of 15 AL teams, averaging just under 20,000 fans a game.  On Wednesday, an 87 degree day with the Royals, a divisional rival that&apos;s also in the playoff hunt, in town, just 12,085 fans turned up to watch their Indians lose 6-2 and slip to two games out of the wildcard. A little more than a week earlier, just 9,962 were in the house to see the Baltimore Orioles (who are having their own attendance issues at the moment), a September low for the ballpark that opened up to acclaim in 1994. Outfielder Michael Bourn, one of the offseason signings that has helped boost the Indians chances in 2013 recently told the Cleveland Plain Dealer:  If you&apos;re in the hunt this close, the stands should almost be filled up every night. It&apos;s not like we&apos;re way out of it. We&apos;re right there in the hunt. It&apos;s not like we&apos;re 15 games out of it right now and trying to make some crazy run. We&apos;re right there. We&apos;re in the thick of things.  Francona also recently told the Plain Dealer:  I think everybody would rather play to a packed house. It&apos;s more fun, more enthusiasm in the ballpark. We also know this city&apos;s been hit pretty hard in these times. So I guess the way I view it is the people who come and the people who watch the Indians, I hope they leave happy. That&apos;s really how we feel. The people who come are very loyal and I think you also have to recognize that this town has been hit, and you just have to respect that.  A roam around the local Cleveland media reveals the following theories as to why attendance is so poor: \u2022 The Indians decision to sell the radio rights to a news/talk station rather than the all-sports stations - a presence on a sports network would generate more Tribe chat during the day and drum up more interest - at least in theory. \u2022 Back in the 1990s when the Indians revived, began winning and started to fill seats, the NFL&apos;s Browns weren&apos;t around. Now that the sport has returned to a football crazed town, there is less focus on baseball. The economy was also stronger during the sellout streak.  \u2022 The stadium was in its infancy during the sellout streak - with the novelty of a new venue long gone, it&apos;s all about the baseball, which has been poor for several seasons, until now.  \u2022 That couch gets more and more comfortable every day, and wow, that TV sure looks good.  My thoughts? Well, this season, you could say that their inability to beat good teams has preventing fans from taking them seriously. Cleveland are 42-18 against losing teams, but have the worst record amongst playoff contenders against teams with winning records. Then there&apos;s the idea that this team, for its talent, just isn&apos;t all that interesting. There are good players - Justin Masterson, Jason Kipnis and Carlos Santana - but for the most part, there&apos;s not a lot of flash. Jason Giambi is always worth a look and Chris Perez, who is mostly disliked in Cleveland and who has sounded about about attendance in the past, sent marijuana to his home in his dog&apos;s name, which is promising. After that, there&apos;s not much to hang your hat on.  Despite their loss on Wednesday, the Indians&apos; remaining schedule is favorable - there are trips to Chicago and Kansas City, then home against Houston, before more games against the White Sox and four in Minnesota. Given Cleveland&apos;s reputation this season for trashing bad teams, that puts them in a favorable position to eclipse Tampa and reach the playoffs. Would Clevelanders fill up their stadium for playoff games? Who wants it? The Tampa Bay Rays are 4-13 since August 24th. The Texas Rangers have dropped seven of their last nine games - these are your current American League wildcard leaders. It&apos;s hard to believe they&apos;re still out in front considering the way they&apos;re playing as the season nears a close, that is, until you look at how nearly everyone else chasing them are playing. The Orioles are 8-9 in their previous 17. After starting out September strong, the Yankees are 4-4 in their last eight - hardly playoff baseball. The Tribe also started off the month well, but have now lost three of four games. The most consistent team this month are the Kansas City Royals, who have climbed into the playoff race by going 8-3 in September, moving from 6.5 games behind Tampa in that second wildcard slot to just two games out - that&apos;s nearly five games made up in 11 days. Meanwhile, over in the National League, the Washington Nationals have won five straight games, closing to within six of the Cincinnati Reds thanks to their dropping two of three games to the Cubs this week.             Some wildcard injury news: the Yankees crawl to the finish will take place without Derek Jeter, 39, whose surgically repaired ankle put him on the disabled list once again this season, this time for the rest of the year. Jeter, who played just 17 games in a season he describes as a nightmare, has a player option to return to New York for $8m next season according to baseball-reference.com. In Cleveland, Justin Masterson said on Monday that he expects to play again this season. The Tribes&apos; ace is attempting to recover from an oblique strain ahead of schedule. Bryce Harper, who has struggled with injury issues for a major chunk of the season, has missed five games this month but returned to the lineup in their 3-0 win over the Mets in Flushing, going 1-4, including this smash hit.  Seeing a red (and blue) October in September Who do you want to see in the World Series? The Pittsburgh Pirates? A great story for a set of fans that deserve a winner. The Tigers? Miguel Cabrera, Prince Fielder, Max Scherzer, Justin Verlander - a fabulous group in Detroit if not just a touch dull. The Reds? Strong pitch, strong hit, a well rounded force - watchable. The Yankees? Mariano Rivera is on his way out of New York, Alex Rodriguez may be behind him - New York drama, always a strong candidate. The Cardinals? They&apos;re so 2011. Texas? They&apos;re in the midst of another September skid and they could find themselves out of the picture if they don&apos;t stop the bleeding. The A&apos;s? Their band of brothers in Oakland are colorful, as baseball fans know - decent choice. The Orioles? Manny Machado, Chris Davis...getting warmer. The Rays? The dome is a buzz kill for everybody. The Braves? Eh. The Nationals? If they somehow get in, it could get interesting, I guess.  Apologies to the afore mentioned, but Tuesday night, while flipping through games, my ideal World Series flashed before my eyes - an epiphany of sorts.  When we reach the final two teams in October it has to be Boston and Los Angeles, the Dodgers and the Red Sox playing for the ugly gold trophy. Talk about a matchup, talk about first class backdrops - the only thing better would be swapping out picture perfect Dodger Stadium for Wrigley Field in a World Series featuring Fenway Park. The late season 2012 trade between LA and Boston helped set up their spectacular seasons, so it makes perfect sense that these teams with enormous fan bases meet.  If only Josh Beckett were healthy for such a series, just imagine what his appearance in Boston would be like. A series where Clayton Kershaw faces David Ortiz in a huge spot. A series where Carl Crawford and Adrian Gonzalez make dents in the Green Monster. A series where Dustin Pedroia and other scrappy Sox bring a dust bowl to Chavez Ravine. A series where Yasiel Puig runs rampant in right at Fenway. Koji Uehara, Matt Kemp (possibly) Mike Napoli, Clay Buchholz (who looked good in his first start since June on Tuesday) , Carl Crawford, Zack Greinke, Jacoby Ellsbury (if he can recover from that broken foot) - too many good to great players to mention and story-lines to mention, including an ex-Yankee in the Dodgers dugout. It would be as big as it gets, an instant classic this fall. And so as we eagerly await the regular season to conclude, that&apos;s my wish for October - how about you? Big in Japan     Yakult Swallows' Wladimir Balentien is likely to become the single season home run record holder in  Japan - he hit his 55th home run on Wednesday to tie the mark. Photograph: AP    Wladimir Balentien is on the verge of making history - not in Major League Baseball where his career began, but in Japan where his professional career took off. The Cura\u00e7ao native tied the NPB single season home run record of 55 on Wednesday and now has 21 games to make it his own. The Yakult Swallows slugger began the year on the sidelines with a leg injury, missing the first 12 games before making up for lost time by going on a season long tear. The outfielder spent parts of three campaigns with the Mariners and the Reds, putting up a .655 OPS, a number that has nearly doubled in 2013. Now now he&apos;s one big fly from passing Japanese baseball icon Sadaharu Oh, along with co-record holders Tuffy Rhodes and Alex Cabrera for the prestigious mark. As the New York Times pointed out recently, foreign players who have threatened the record in the past have been pitched around to ensure they did not pass Oh, who despite being born in Taiwan is seen as a national treasure. Japanese baseball is said to have thawed somewhat when it comes to protecting the records of their own and really, I can&apos;t believe that hurlers could pitch around a hitter for 21 games without making the league look like a complete and total disgrace. Meanwhile, the NPB are using a new ball this season which the league reluctantly admitted in June had been tweaked to fly farther - it seems to have worked with home runs up in a big way in 2013. The tweak, which was done secretly, was a reaction to an initial tweak in 2011 which deadened the ball and led to a serious decline in homers. Now perhaps they&apos;ve overdone it meaning that there could soon be an asterisk debate over the single season home run record on two continents. Marlins won&apos;t back own franchise player On Wednesday Jose Fernandez, the Marlins candidate for National League Rookie of the Year, made his final start of the season. The 21-year old, who finished with a 2.19 ERA, 187 strikeouts and a 12-6 record became the latest young pitcher to be shut down before the end of the season, just as Stephen Strasburg was in 2012, as general managers continue to pretend they know something about preventing injuries when in fact they know very little.  That&apos;s not the story today however, rather, it was Fernandez finishing with a bang, connecting on his first big league home run, one that led to a bench clearing incident. Fernandez, who pitched seven innings of one-run ball in Miami&apos;s 5-2 victory, watched his handiwork after crushing a Mike Minor pitch over the left center wall - that amounts to showing up a pitcher, a major offense in baseball&apos;s silly unwritten rule book we hear so much about. This of course offended Braves third baseman Chris Johnson and Braves catcher Brian McCann who greeted Fernandez with a lecture at home plate. Johnson, seeing the exchange, charged furiously at Fernandez, before hilariously taking his place behind the umpire as benches cleared.  Here is what the video does not show: \u2022\u00a0Braves Rookie Evan Gattis hit a home run earlier off Fernandez and he also took time to admire his work. Fernandez could be seen smiling and saying &quot;wow&quot;, either because Gattis showed him up or because he was impressed with Gattis&apos; home run.  \u2022\u00a0Later in the game, Chris Johnson was chirping at Fernandez as he ran up the line after flying out. Fernandez was visibly upset and his manager Mike Redmond took him into the tunnel to help relax his player in-between innings.  Then the Cuban-born Fernandez got his revenge, thumping Minor&apos;s pitch over the wall and watching it fly, which seems like a reasonable reply. When you sum it up, all Fernandez really did to Minor is what was what was done to him, and for whatever reason, probably because the kid was destroying the Braves, Atlanta couldn&apos;t handle it.  For this so called immature behavior, Fernandez was taken to task not just by the Braves but by his own manager for showing up a pitcher and &apos;not respecting the game&quot;, so much so that he was basically guilted in to apologizing in a press conference and then personally to Braves players. Mike Redmond said that his night was ruined by Fernandez&apos; immaturity, which is one of the worst managerial decisions I can imagine. Unless there is something we are not seeing or hearing about, to not back your own rookie franchise cornerstone is inexcusable and a decision that will likely come back to haunt Redmond own the road.

The vote clears the way for the huge buyout, in which Dell is working with private equity partners Silver Lake after seeing off a challenge from activist investor Carl Icahn. The move comes as traditional PC companies struggle to make money in a market that is rapidly shrinking, with the latest forecasts showing that PC sales will be overtaken by tablets for the first time in the final quarter of this year. Research group IDC said tablets will outsell all PCs in the three months to Christmas, and by 2015 they will regularly outsell PCs as consumers&apos; tastes shift towards the more mobile format. &quot;We are forecasting 84.1m tablets will be shipped in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to 83.1m PCs,&quot; said an IDC spokesman. The abruptness of the shift \u2013 modern tablets only went on sale with the launch of Apple&apos;s iPad in April 2010 \u2013 has caught a number of traditional PC companies, including Dell, flatfooted and with no viable strategy in the fast-growing mobile\u00a0market. By 2017, says IDC, 87% of devices connected to the internet will be tablets and smartphones, relegating PCs from their former position as the main means of getting online. Speaking after the Dell vote, Francisco Jeronimo, IDC&apos;s smartphones analyst, said the wider market shift will &quot;kill many old companies and create new leaders&quot;. PC makers such as Dell have struggled with limited profits for years. But as consumers, who made up half of PC buyers, have shifted spending to tablets and smartphones, the industry has suffered falls in sales which are squeezing small and large players alike. Michael Dell, who founded the company from a college dorm room in 1984, has fought for months to convince investors his offer is the best option for the company&apos;s future. Icahn ended his challenge after deciding it was &quot;impossible to win&quot;. Dell has been forced into a buyout after 25 years on the stock market because the PC market is dwindling so rapidly. The company reported a 72% slump in quarterly earnings last month as it cut prices and prepared an attack on the market for supplying big &quot;enterprise&quot; businesses. The iPad was rapidly followed by more tablets, from companies including Samsung, Amazon and Google. After years when PC sales growth was regularly between 10% and 20%, it has gone into reverse for the past five quarters, and IDC forecasts a drop of nearly 10% this year. Other companies besides Dell have been hit due to the lack of a successful tablet strategy. Taiwan&apos;s Acer, one of the five biggest PC makers, has seen profits collapse since 2011, and revenues have shrunk for five quarters in a row. HP, which bought Palm for $1bn but wrote off its TouchPad tablet in August 2011 after less than two months, is also struggling to make a profit from PCs. Michael Dell argues that the company needs to go private so it can restructure to cope with the new computing landscape away from the quarterly pressures of Wall Street, and focus as IBM does on providing its storage, servers and services to public organisations and large companies. Dell first proposed the buyout in private discussions in June 2012. It was announced on 5 February at $13.65 per share. Rival bidder Blackstone raised that to $14.25 in March, and Icahn offered $15 soon afterwards. Dell finally offered $13.75 per share. A vote on the buyout had been postponed three times as Michael Dell and the company&apos;s board scrambled to garner enough votes in favour. But last month Dell raised his offer price, tacked on a special-dividend sweetener, and got the board to change voting rules so that abstentions no longer count against him \u2013 turning the tide in his favour. A change of over two months in the deadline for proxy votes may also have brought backing from hedge funds that bought shares for short-term gain and were likely to support a buyout."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/20/typhoon-usagi-philippines-taiwan-hong-kong", "publicationDate": "2013-09-20T11:38:00Z", "tags": ["Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Asia"], "sentences": ["The Philippines has evacuated northern coastal villages, suspended ferries and called in fishing boats as the category 5 storm moves between the country and Taiwan, later headed for Hong Kong and China."], "title": "Super typhoon Usagi set to hit the western Pacific: share your images and stories", "article": "The Philippines has evacuated northern coastal villages, suspended ferries and called in fishing boats as the category 5 storm moves between the country and Taiwan, later headed for Hong Kong and China.

In many countries, eating meat is part of the national identity. Think of Australian barbecues, American cowboys and South American cattle ranchers. There was controversy earlier this year when President Obama hosted a dinner for 12 Republican senators, and one of them ordered a vegetarian meal. The identity of the culprit was protected, for fear that exposure could mean losing their seat. TV host Bill Maher commented that American voters would sooner elect a gay president than a vegetarian. Republican senators in Iowa and Texas said vegetarians were &apos;&apos;un-American&quot; and made public pledges to eat more meat. Still, once you&apos;ve waved the political madness aside, you&apos;ll find that cutting-edge vegetarian and vegan cuisine thrives on America&apos;s east and west coasts. San Francisco still benefits from its hippie heritage with decent vegetarian and vegan options as standard around the Haight. San Francisco&apos;s Zen Center established Greens in 1976, and various cookbooks from its resident chefs continue to influence the menus of vegetarian eateries worldwide. Millennium, in the city centre, ranks as one of the world&apos;s top vegan restaurants with impressive high-end cuisine. Seattle and Portland are hot spots, with vegan bakeries, breweries, clothing stores, bike shops and even \u2013 in Portland \u2013 a vegan strip joint. However, Peta&apos;s choice for the top city in the US this year was, surprisingly, Austin, Texas. In the heart of ranching country, vegan entreprenuers have taken to the streets with food trucks offering tempeh burritos and chicken faux-jitas. It can still be a struggle to find vegetarian food in small-town diners, and it makes most sense to look for sustenance in areas that are highly populated and diverse: big cosmopolitan cities are the best place to look for vegetarian and vegan food. Barcelona is fast becoming a hot spot for vegetarians, whether your preference is for punk bars or candle-lit fine dining. Elsewhere in Spain, it can be a struggle to explain that vegetarians don&apos;t eat ham. Likewise Berlin, another city where countercultures thrive, offers a good deal more for the vegetarian or vegan visitor than more rural German towns. France is notoriously hard work for vegetarians, and it can be far easier to settle for an omelette than to brave the ire of a waiter in a high-end French restaurant, but Paris has more than 30 exclusively vegetarian eateries. Even Russia, where vegetarianism was actually banned and driven underground for decades after the revolution, offers enough meat-free dining experiences in St Petersburg and Moscow to keep vegetarian visitors out of a rut for a week or so. Any bustling city with a diverse population, cultural leanings and a university or two can generally be relied upon to offer a few exclusively vegetarian cafes, but often the food on offer is disappointingly divorced from the national cuisine. Falafels and hummus, veggie burgers, pizza, pasta and Indian-style buffets are pretty standard all over the place, but getting a vegetarian meal in, for example, a restaurant that specialises in typical Danish food can be very hard work. Vegetarian visitors to Denmark tend to rely on curry houses and Turkish kebab shops that offer falafels, tabbouleh and salad-filled pittas. There&apos;s no history of meat-free eating in Belgium \u2013 even the chips are often cooked in lard. Belgian vegetarian food makes frequent use of seitan, a surprisingly realistic meat substitute made from wheat gluten. Against all odds, the EVA (Ethisch Vegetarisch Alternatief) has persuaded many cafes and restaurants in its home town, Ghent, to adopt Paul McCartney&apos;s Meat-Free Monday idea and serve vegetarian food one day a week \u2013 in this case, Thursdays. Ghent also has more vegetarian restaurants per capita than most cities (13 for a population of 240,000). Of course, there are many parts of the world where vegetarianism is widespread, largely because of religious principles and dietary laws. Hindus, Jains and Taoists all advocate vegetarianism to a greater or lesser extent, and this has a positive effect on the availability of vegetarian food in India and Asia. Between 20% and 40% of India&apos;s population is vegetarian \u2013 the figure is muddied by the fact that most Indian Hindus do not consider people who eat eggs to be vegetarian. Clear food labelling laws make things easy for vegetarian visitors. Most of the food served at Sikh gurdwaras is vegetarian, not because Sikhs are required to be vegetarian but because they aim to offer food that is acceptable to as many people as possible. Countries with large Buddhist populations are generally good destinations for vegetarians, although the Buddhist approach to vegetarianism varies and is often misunderstood. The Theravada tradition, dominant in Thailand, teaches that it is all right to eat meat if it is offered to you, the Mahayana Buddhists of Taiwan, Vietnam and Japan recommend vegetarianism, and Tibetan Vajravana Buddhists consider vegetarianism optional. Being vegetarian would have been tricky in a mountainous region centuries ago, so it&apos;s hardly surprising that countries with climates that support plentiful harvests of fruit and vegetables tend to have more of a history of vegetarianism than those whose inhabitants are forced to rely on eating fish or animals that do not require lush grazing land. Vegetarian travellers can also benefit from religious dietary observations that don&apos;t directly advocate vegetarianism. In Israel, Kashrut laws require that meat and dairy produce are not served together, making it relatively easy to find vegetarian food. In some African countries, such as Ethiopia, the Christian faith calls for frequent days of fasting, when only meat-free or vegan meals are acceptable. British vegetarianism has Christian roots, too. Abstinence from meat was considered a form of temperance in the early 1800s, and over the years many radical thinkers embraced the idea. During the second world war, rationing conferred luxury status on meat, but interest in vegetarianism perked up again in the 1960s, thanks to trendsetters such as the Beatles, who brought the idea to a new audience. In today&apos;s multicultural society, it is easy to find meat-free specialities from all over the world. Add to that clear labelling regulations, and the UK has to be one of the easiest places in the world to be vegetarian."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/24/tech-startups-the-stockholm-guide", "publicationDate": "2013-09-24T10:40:31Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Technology startups", "Stockholm holidays", "Sweden", "Mobile phones", "Spotify", "3D", "Digital media", "Games", "Wearable technology", "Data and computer security"], "sentences": ["But Candy Crush has been the number one game in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore."], "title": "Tech startups: the Stockholm guide", "article": "Welcome to Stockholm: in constant iteration\u00a0 Caroline Walerud, co-founder of 3D scanning startup Volumental, explains that even in Sweden&apos;s mature startup scene, she had to turn to Kickstarter this summer to raise more than $20,000 in seed funding  Volumental, my own startup, was born in a hotel room during a Skype call at 3am in October 2012. I was calling three technologists from Stockholm&apos;s\u00a0Royal Institute of Technology, whom I had first met just days before. We decided to start the world\u2019s first cloud-based 3D scanning service.\u00a0 The 3D revolution will change the world, but it requires access both to 3D printers and to 3D models for printing. But those 3D models are still too difficult to create - and that is what Volumental is here to change, from one of the top startup hotspots in the world.\u00a0      Caroline Walerud of 3D scanning startup Volumental. Photo by&nbsp;stockholminnovation&nbsp;on&nbsp;Flickr.&nbsp;All rights reserved     Welcome to Stockholm, birthplace of Mojang\u00a0and Spotify. We\u2019re an educated, early-adopter people, often described as trendy Germans who speak great English. We\u2019re tech-savvy and, with the help of a supportive ecosystem, our startups quickly go global. Volumental&apos;s first customer, for example, was Australian.\u00a0 Still, we are the land of the &apos;safety junkies&apos;, as described by the Swedish psychiatrist\u00a0David Eberhard. It pains me to write that Swedes are afraid of failure, but we are. Like it or not, successful ventures are not built in the lab; they evolve through repeated market testing. In that evolution, failure is natural and weeds out bad ideas. Failure should welcome feedback.\u00a0 Unfortunately even the government is afraid of failure, despite most early capital coming from public institutions with book-long applications. Early grants are earmarked for consultants, pushing the focus away from sales and towards administration and meticulous business planning.\u00a0          An introduction to Volumental     The Swedish innovation agency Vinnova\u00a0is doing a great job changing that approach, but they can&apos;t do it alone. Private funding cannot fill this gap: due to suffocating tax laws on investment\u00a0Sweden has few business angels, and even venture capitalists are safety junkies in their own way. Because of this, Volumental is focusing on international funding sources, such as our Kickstarter campaign\u00a0that went live this summer and exceeded its fundraising target.\u00a0 How do startups compete with big business? That safety dependency means we fight for magical people, but they prefer stability. Instead of high salaries, we want to incentivise with shares and stock options, but tax regulation made this almost impossible to set up. Sweden must realise that today we are fighting for the rising stars in a global market, losing start-ups to the speedier Silicon Valley. In that 3am call, I took the leap into Volumental. It was the first of many late nights when we were only a team of techies with a cool idea, months of hard work with no pay and constantly firefighting problems.\u00a0 We\u2019re still learning from our failures, now with customers, funding and a team of eleven, and getting closer to success. This is part of Stockholm - a capital iterating on its failures, and getting better every time.  Caroline Walerud, chief executive and co-founder of Volumental  Klarna: The biggest mobile startup you&apos;ve never heard of Klarna tells Jemima Kiss why its payment system takes the pain out of buying on mobile, and why it is also sitting on a powerful big data play \u2022 One-click mobile payments tool \u2022 Used for 30% of Sweden&apos;s ecommerce transactions \u2022 Pay later option that consolidates bills across multiple retailers  Buy something using Klarna on any retail site and you&apos;ll immediately notice the difference: a clean, minimised login that can be done in one click, and you can choose to pay immediately using Visa, Mastercard or online banking \u2013 or choose to pay next month. Director of product management Ted Bowman says complex logins, repeating information and paying before goods arrive were all points of pain that Klarna is trying to fix.\u00a0 &quot;We think we are the first product that makes people want to buy on mobile,&quot; he adds. &quot;No one has totally cracked it but we&apos;re very focused on mobile conversions.&quot;     Klarna's mobile checkout service. Photograph: Klarna    Bowman\u00a0explains how the fiddly process of buying online is easily disrupted \u2013 the doorbell rings, the kids kick off, you can&apos;t find your purse \u2013 so the simpler to process, the more likely you are to complete the transaction. And if you buy using Klarna from multiple sites, you can pay the whole bill together once each month. How can Klarna offer credit to consumers without taking on too much risk? The answer, says Bowman, is by employing far more sophisticated and comprehensive ways of tracking a user&apos;s creditworthiness. &quot;We think we have the best risk assessment in the world, looking at 142 different factors on a transaction-by-transaction basis, from social media and time of day and to data on individual things you have bought. If you suddenly go online and buy five iPads shipping to Romania at 5am, we&apos;ll flag that up.&quot;     Ted Bowman, Klarna's director of product management. Photograph: Klarna    The front end, meanwhile, combines a simple interface with the idea of making Klarna the &apos;want&apos; button on retail sites. The focus is on being part of a physical goods delivery system - there is no interest in being used to buy virtual goods, which have a less tangible value. One click checkout is done using your email address or phone number, and the process uses information from previous orders or a third party provider to prefill the rest of your details.\u00a0 How ethical is it to gather this kind of fine grain information about consumers and use it against them in this way? &quot;The German authorities are very particular about the data we use to make credit decisions,&quot; says comms VP Claes Tellman, who not coincidentally has a background in the risk assessment-heavy gambling industry. &quot;Debts are growing for younger people, but debts on Klarma have gone down to 0.5%. We don&apos;t let debtors in.&quot; Are they challenging PayPal? &quot;We&apos;d be happy to have the level of success they have had in the US but we do think there is room for improvement,&quot; says product manager Phil Mikal of the eight countries in which Klaran operates. &quot;Our product is not the same country to country, and we learn through the pain and success of each unique product.&quot; In Sweden, the benefits are a highly educated workforce with a way of working that is very focused on solutions to problems, he explains. Swedish companies tend to be less hierarchical, so junior staff are more free to questions managers.\u00a0     Stockholm's archipelago.&nbsp;Photograph: Ville Hyv&ouml;nen/flickr    Klarna&apos;s story is a familiar one of tenacious founders in their early 20s with a good idea. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Victor Jacobsson and Niklas Adalberth have had a meteoric rise from meeting at Burger King, to a level of ubiquity in Sweden on a par with cash or credit cards, where Klarna accounts for 30% of all ecommerce transactions. Klarna&apos;s slick Stockholm offices are home to most of its 800 staff, backed by Sequoia, General Atlantic, Digital Sky, Oresund and by veteran Swedish investor Jane Walerud \u2013 mother of Volumental founder Caroline \u2013 who pitched in the first $80,000 back in 2005.\u00a0 There&apos;s an intensity and growth in Sweden that echoes the success of Silicon Valley, but a particularly Swedish thought leadership, commercial polish and highly skilled workforce.\u00a0     Klarna's new office, as modelled in Lego. Photograph: Jemima Kiss    Klarna is being used by 15,000 merchants, starting to expand from its large user base in Sweden, and has been used by 20 million individual consumers for 60m transactions since launch. It processed \u20ac2bn in transaction volumes for 2012 with an average spend of \u20ac40, and is profitable with &quot;a couple of hundred million in revenues&quot; since launch.\u00a0 As well as breaking new markets, Klarna is also looking at its goldmine of real-time retail data; a powerful chunk of market insight especially at peaks such as Christmas. Compare that to market insight at the startup Editd, which mines fashion sector data from retail and trend watching sites to inform retailers designs, stock and price points and you can see how powerful, though sensitive, this cross-industry could be. &quot;That would have to be rolled out in a universally accepted way because sharing data between merchants is controversial. We&apos;re not yet at a point where we could release that as a product, but we are looking at that on our roadmap.&quot;  Tictail: the future of selling online Tictail&apos;s sleek, simple and brilliant plan is to be the Tumblr of online stores \u2013 and with an API to match.

Listen to the interview on Soundcloud here      Spotify: why discovery tools put it on course for the mainstream Beloved by music geeks the world over, Spotify is arguably Sweden&apos;s most famous modern export. But how can the service move into the mainstream? Jemima Kiss speaks to Ian Robbins on Spotify&apos;s product development team for music discovery \u2022 Sweden&apos;s most famous startup wants a more mainstream consumer audience \u2022 Web version and stickier recommendations designed for more plays \u2022 Artist pages to be pushed as promotional tools     Spotify's lobby at its Stockholm HQ. Photograph: Jemima Kiss    Music discovery has been top of Spotify users&apos; request list since, arguably, the service began. The site offers two different experiences, explains Ian Robbins from the product development team; the lean forward user who knows exactly what she wants to listen to and isn&apos;t daunted by that blank search box; and the lean back user, who wants a more serendipitous experience akin to radio.\u00a0 It&apos;s that leanback experience that had been missing until the discovery feature for the web app launched in April on trial and then more broadly in May this year. Crucially, discovery is a feature designed to pull in and keep new users, making the service more sticky and accessible \u2013 and mainstream. &quot;Personalisation is a powerful experience and infectious,&quot; said Robbins. &quot;When you come into the product from the first day as a new user, it shows what you&apos;re listening to, what might interest you and tells you that if you follow artists and bands the experience will become even more personalised.&quot;\u00a0     Collaborative workspace at Spotify. Photo: Jemima Kiss    Users who browse more play more music, he said, pointing to user data, so the aim is to encourage more playlists and more plays. He described more &quot;affection&quot; for Spotify itself once those kind of discoveries have been unlocked. This desire to appeal to a mainstream music fan informs the way that Spotify rolls out new products; rather than use an elite group of Spotify obsessives or musos to test new features, the site now rolls out to 1% of all users, then 2%, then 5% and then site-wide. Feedback is then far more relevant for the majority of users. Spotify admits to being caught out by the speed at which users are moving to mobile platforms. &quot;It makes &apos;platformisation&apos; even more important. Everything is now mobile first,&quot; says Robbins. &quot;That isn&apos;t the priority for all companies \u2013 it depends what the product or service is, and who the user base is.&quot;\u00a0 iPhone users, for Spotify, are slightly more geeky, but the rocketing number of Android users \u2013 and more mainstream users \u2013 means it is now as important to develop for.\u00a0 The three core products are now iPad, iPhone and web app, the latter being a significant step towards reaching a mainstream who might be uncomfortable downloading desktop software.     A Nirvana-themed meeting room at Spotify's HQ. Photograph: Jemima Kiss    There are clever tweaks in discovery; the new preview tool plays with press-and-hold, so click off and the current song continues playing. A little of the touch-and-hold of Vine? The preview is a small clip a certain percentage of the way through the song \u2013 &quot;the magical mean&quot;.\u00a0 Spotify has also ditched the &quot;friend&quot; model in favour of the &quot;follow&quot; model; Robbins describes this as a broader and more relevant term, as users can follow albums as well as artists. Those artist pages can now be customised, giving them a profile to curate and making followers \u2013 their fans \u2013 visible.\u00a0 Making playlists for fans is popular; Daft Punk do this regularly, and the massive success of Get Lucky on Spotify (and everywhere else) has made it the site&apos;s number one track of all time with more than 63m listens. Robbins talks about the acquisition of fellow Swedish playlist company Tunigo in May. &quot;It was already one of our best partners and the traffic stood out last year \u2013 it&apos;s about brilliant curation.&quot; It gave Spotify a market-tested playlist tool, and accelerated its work on music discovery tools.\u00a0 &quot;Phase four is to expand that artists experience to more of a promotional platform,&quot; Robbins says. &quot;That follow model means artists can take advantage of having all those fans, so they could ask followers to log in to share a preview of their new single. We want to create a level of customisation that is measured, so not quite the MySpace side of the spectrum but not the same site for everyone \u2013 developers get tools, and artists get promotion.&quot;  Stockholm soundbites: Johan Jorgensen of FundedByMe Jemima Kiss interviews Johan Jorgensen of\u00a0FundedByMe, a platform that connects investors with entrepreneurs Reading on mobile?

King&apos;s own focus on that area, and refining a format that has worked repeatedly, came after their initial strategy of partnering with portals such as Yahoo started to falter.     King is working on hit-proofing its games. Photo: Jemima Kiss    &quot;Facebook was sucking the air out of casual game play but that took a while to understand that,&quot; says Sebastian Knutsson, chief creative officer. &quot;We reinvented what we did, took half the Stockholm staff and put them on new formats using our knowledge of games, until we found formats that work well.\u00a0 King is profitable, though Knutsson won&apos;t talk financials. Users are 50% to 60% female in that 25-45 age bracket, although more men are finding King&apos;s titles since it began to focus more on mobile; they seem happier to admit to playing these accessible, populist games on mobile than on Facebook.\u00a0     King's Thomas Hartwig and Sebastian Knutsson. Photograph: /PR    Its runaway success is the Candy Crush saga, a familiar format of addictively rearranging colourful sweets. &quot;We don&apos;t expect every game to reach that level of success, but we are trying to hit-proof the business by launching games on our platform on the web in a smaller, lighter form, then get a sense of the response and embellish the gameplay,&quot; says Knutsson. &quot;We have a higher success rate than most, but many of our games are evergreen. Card games are as popular as ever, and Tetris just as much as it was 20 years ago.&quot; For casual gamers, or people just starting, it&apos;s normal to start with something that feels familiar, even nostalgic, just as new users of Spotify tend to search for the music they loved 20 years ago. The way to engage those users is not by giving them tools to brag about their achievements, but with tools that let friends help each other \u2013 particularly on the infamous level 65 of Candy Crush.\u00a0     King's games had around 92 million daily users, as of June 2013, with Candy Crush its breakout hit. Photograph: /PR    King has offices in London, Stockholm, Hamburg and Bucharest among others. Knutsson said the focus on product and innovation \u2013 perhaps without the bluster and hype of some US social games companies \u2013 has contributed to a stealthy success for this sector; Scandinavian games accounted for five of the top 10 iPhone games at time of writing. It&apos;s often said, but the principle of being humble about success is innate. &quot;I think you have to be careful about believing that success is permanent, that we have to say what the mistakes are and build the right internal culture and manage that success in a good way,&quot; says co-founder Thomas Hartwig. The team develops games quickly \u2013 about three months is typical from conception to launch \u2013 and the focus is on developing game IP, though the ideas that don&apos;t work are just as important in informing game design.     Plans afoot in King's Stockholm office. Photo: Jemima Kiss    It&apos;s easier to grow new territories on mobile, he said, but while there is huge potential in the US and Europe, it&apos;s Asia \u2013 particularly Japan and China \u2013 that would be the grand prize. &quot;There&apos;s intense competition from local players and it&apos;s hard for western companies to grow big. China has a huge market and big studios. The future giants will be Asian \u2013 Tencent has something like 48,000 staff. But Candy Crush has been the number one game in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. The game is general enough that it speaks to a mainstream audience but needs strong marketing channels and partnerships to get into that market.&quot; There are 39 staff at King who work on data analysis, using information on gameplay to inform their new titles. &quot;That work with data combines with intuition and experience to fine tune our games. But longevity is trickier than getting the one hit that explodes. Repeating it is the big challenge, though there is an advantage in being in a segment where the games aren&apos;t really bleeding edge \u2013 the consumers are less fickle, and if you have good relationships with those consumers you can keep them for 10 years.&quot;  Stockholm soundbites:\u00a0Fredrik Espinoza and Magnus Sahlgren of Gavagai Semantic data analysis tool for speech Gavagai\u00a0has multiple applications.

Photo: Jemima Kiss Photograph: /Jemima Kiss    While most of the rest of the newspaper industry was tying itself in knots about the death of print, Norway&apos;s Schibsted was ploughing ahead with diversification. In 2003, Schibsted paid around \u00a320m for blocket.se, a traditional online classifieds site that has become a template for complementary businesses to Schibsted&apos;s media portfolio. With plans to close the printing presses in 2017, the race to online profitability is on. Though &quot;considered reckless&quot; by the media at the time, according to head of growth investments Dan Ouchterlony, Blocket has become Sweden&apos;s biggest classifieds site and profits quickly grew to justify the purchase price; in 2012, EBITDA profit grew 54% year on year to \u00a341m. Schibsted had failed to replicate what Blocket was doing in the early days, and so bought the site instead.\u00a0     Blocket is Sweden's most successful classifieds site. Photo by&nbsp;THS Armada&nbsp;on&nbsp;Flickr.&nbsp;Some rights reserved.    &quot;The decision was not a management one, but driven from the floor because journalists felt classifieds were a natural extension,&quot; says Ouchterlony. Schibsted has invested in another seven established classifieds sites, including Willhaben.at in Austria and Coches.net in Spain, as well as 14 earlier stage sites including Mudah\u00a0in Malaysia and Bikhir.ma\u00a0in Morocco. Most are based on the Blocket model, though Richard Sandenskog, a former journalist and the investment manager for Schibsted Growth, says the point is not to make a quick buck out of consumers, but to provide tools that help them make better decisions.\u00a0     Aftonbladet office. Photo by&nbsp;bengt-re&nbsp;on&nbsp;Flickr.&nbsp;Some rights reserved.    Schibsted&apos;s media properties include Norway&apos;s Aftenpost\u00a0and Verdens Gang, the 20 Minutes brand in France, Spain\u00a0and Switzerland\u00a0and the Swedish national tabloid Aftonbladet. Aftonbladet&apos;s network claimed 4.8 million unique browsers\u00a0for the last week of August 2013 making it one of the busiest sites in Sweden, with Blocket recording 3.3 million. Another principle has been to use unsold inventory on Schibsted&apos;s media sites to promote its own companies \u2013 rather than flogging the space through services like Google who auction to the highest display bidder. TV guides, weather, daily deals, personal finance, insurance and mobile price plans all complement those media sites, said Sandenskog. Schibsted&apos;s sunny open-plan Stockholm offices are buzzing with banks of startup teams, all working on these complementary products.     Schibsted's early-stage startups share its Stockholm office. Photograph: Jemima Kiss    &quot;Journalists don&apos;t think they are in the media business \u2013 they think they are in the content production business, so they don&apos;t get excited about new business models. But the fact that we have this model today shows we are major global players \u2013 the mindset is a more commercialised environment than broadsheets.&quot; Sandenskog said journalism has been addicted to the ad-funded model for 150 years, yet display advertising is just not large enough to support news businesses now. &quot;Management has been doing this long enough to be curious about what could happen if they bet on the internet, and did so even during the financial crisis \u2013 we effectively moved to cannibalise our own business.&quot;\u00a0 But the window of opportunity to develop these consumer-focused web businesses is getting increasingly competitive. Concept clones now take months, not years, to roll out and with increasing activity in China and the ever present US, that competition is global. But that does have some benefit for a Scandinavian company initially insulated against English-language competition by its domestic market. &quot;We&apos;re getting bigger and bigger footprints, and can help startups omit VCs,&quot; said Ouchterlony. &quot;We explain that we can help them scale, and use our firehose of marketing power as well as the experience of our 20 portfolio companies.&quot;\u00a0 &quot;There are hundreds of profitable internet companies - very healthy local investments and transparently profitable. The profound conclusion you draw is to not try to be the next Facebook, Google or Twitter.&quot;     From Schibsted's entrance hall.

At the moment, employees are effectively taxed twice on equity, meaning they lose as much as 80% to 90% of the equity value in tax. That makes it much harder for startups to use equity as an incentive to attract new talent \u2013 something that&apos;s standard in the wider tech industry \u2013 so it&apos;s bound to be hugely popular. That said, the Green party won only a 7.3% share of the vote in Sweden&apos;s last election and is very far from being in power, so there is little chance of changing the law unless one of the major parties decide to pick this up. \u2022 &quot;Jantelagen&quot; is somewhere between a social tradition, a cultural mindset and an unspoken characteristic of Scandinavians in which individual success or self-promotion is frowned upon, while humility and shared success is seen as more worthy and valuable. It is often discussed and regularly dismissed, but however realistic, there has unquestionably been a lack of self-promotion and credit for the Swedish startup scene in particular, which punches way above its weight in terms of commercial acumen and talent.\u00a0 \u2022 LA-based tech rabble rouser Tyler Crowley has been living and working in Stockholm this year helping organise Stockholm&apos;s Tech Meetup and motivating entrepreneurs and developers to promote Stockholm&apos;s talent more widely.

HTC developing &apos;alternative plans&apos; after patent case loss to Nokia &gt;&gt; FOCUS TAIWAN  Taiwan&apos;s HTC Corp. said Tuesday after losing the first round of a patent dispute with Finnish handset vendor Nokia Oyj that it is working on alternative plans to minimize the case&apos;s potential impact on its business. In a notice published Monday, Judge Thomas Pender of the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) said HTC had infringed two of the three wireless patents-in-suit claimed by Nokia. Nokia, which filed the complaint in May 2012, had asked the U.S. trade agency to impose a sales ban on certain HTC Android-based phones and tablets. A final ruling is scheduled for Jan. 23 next year after the judge&apos;s findings are reviewed by the six-member panel.  Not standards-essential patents, so Nokia could get a trade ban - or HTC could figure out workarounds. Under the covers: The clever engineering that went into the new Surfaces | CITEworld Mary Branscombe:   What&apos;s so clever about the new second-generation Surface devices, which Microsoft unveiled yesterday? For a start, although the cases look very similar, this isn&apos;t just Haswell slapped into the same motherboard of the Surface Pro - although that might have been faster to bring to market. This is a completely redesigned motherboard, tuned to reduce power consumption as much as possible.  Lots and lots more detail inside. Microsoft new Surface shipments to reach 3 million units in 2014, sources estimate &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Microsoft has unveiled its second-generation Surface tablets, but sources from the upstream supply chain estimate the devices&apos; sales will reach only three million units in 2014, accounting for 1.15% of the global tablet shipments. Microsoft has released its Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2. Microsoft sold about 900,000 Surface tablets in the first quarter of 2013 and 300,000 in the second, totaling 1.2m units in the first half, according to the sources citing figures from IDC. The sources pointed out that the first-generation Surface&apos;s poor sales are mainly due to their high prices although their hardware specifications and industrial design are competitive.  Seems very low. Perhaps it&apos;s moving more to a just-in-time model? Microsoft silent on its reasons for discontinuing original Surface Pro &gt;&gt; Neowin  Even with the high initial demand for the first Surface Pro, Microsoft has decided to stop selling the tablet, though it continues to sell the almost year old Surface RT for a lower price. We asked Microsoft to give us a reason why they have suddenly discontinued the sale of the original Surface Pro, even at a lower price, and received this statement from a Microsoft spokesperson:  When Surface Pro 2 becomes available, Surface Pro will no longer be available for purchase from Microsoft or its retail partners. Our goal is to help as many customers as possible experience all the benefits Surface has to offer. Starting at $349 for Surface RT 32GB, it&apos;s extremely easy to join the Surface family.  Yes, that statement does not really offer a specific reason why the Surface Pro is no longer being sold. We were told that&apos;s the only comment that Microsoft will give officially on this subject.  Could it be that it&apos;s got tons of Surface RT v1 left over and would like to keep selling them, having written their value down to zero in a $900m writeoff last quarter? Why we&apos;re shutting off our comments &gt;&gt; Popular Science Suzanne LaBarre:   even a fractious minority wields enough power to skew a reader&apos;s perception of a story, recent research suggests. In one study led by University of Wisconsin-Madison professor Dominique Brossard, 1,183 Americans read a fake blog post on nanotechnology and revealed in survey questions how they felt about the subject (are they wary of the benefits or supportive?). Then, through a randomly assigned condition, they read either epithet- and insult-laden comments (&quot;If you don&apos;t see the benefits of using nanotechnology in these kinds of products, you&apos;re an idiot&quot; ) or civil comments. The results, as Brossard and coauthor Dietram A. Scheufele wrote in a New York Times op-ed: &quot;Uncivil comments not only polarized readers, but they often changed a participant&apos;s interpretation of the news story itself.&quot;  Remarkable. Be wary of the dubious &apos;iMessage chat&apos; Android app | Macworld  there are a few good reasons to stay away from this iMessage imitator. First, it asks for your Apple ID, which is attached to your personal and payment information. And as Jay Freeman (a.k.a. &apos;saurik&apos; of Cydia fame) notes, all of the app data gets processed through the developer&apos;s server in China before connecting to Apple. This apparently prevents Apple from blocking the app, but it also raises security concerns about what happens to your data and login details. Steve Troughton-Smith also points out that the app has the ability to download and install additional software in the background. Add the fact that the developer hasn&apos;t created any other apps, and you have every reason to be suspicious of this Android version of iMessage.  Is it time for Google to start policing trademark violation on Google Play? It seems like it would be a good way to protect its users. Considering that more than a million have downloaded fake BlackBerry Messenger apps, it could make a difference. Update: Pulled from Google Play, after 13 days, because it &quot;violated policies&quot;. TouchID defeated: what does it mean? &gt;&gt; Erratasec Robert Graham:   Many people claim this hack is &quot;too much trouble&quot;. This is profoundly wrong. Just because it&apos;s too much trouble for you doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s too much trouble for a private investigator hired by your former husband. Or the neighbour&apos;s kid. Or an FBI agent.\u2026 At the same time, it doesn&apos;t mean Touch ID is completely useless. Half the population doesn&apos;t lock their phone at all because it&apos;s too much trouble entering a 4 digit PIN every time they want to use it. If any of them choose to use Touch ID security instead of no security, then it&apos;s a win for security. There are also some ways around the hack. Use your ring finger or pinky finger instead. You don&apos;t use these fingers to navigate your phone, so these prints won&apos;t be on your phone. These are also the most difficult and unlikely prints to retrieve from other surfaces, like beer glasses.  Using your ring finger isn&apos;t possible unless the phone is flat; however you can just about grasp it and manipulate your little finger over the button. Not ideal, though. CEE tablet market continues to rocket, driven by low-cost devices &gt;&gt; IDC  The tablet market in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) continues to surge, growing 175.6% year on year in the second quarter of 2013, according to the latest results from International Data Corporation (IDC). Tablet shipments totaled 3.6m units in 2Q13, making the CEE region among the strongest growing markets worldwide. The ongoing market expansion has been increasingly fueled by low-cost Android devices. Android tablets captured 84% of the total CEE tablet market in 2Q13, accounting for over 3m shipments. The share of iOS-based devices decreased by 9.2 percentage points year on year, while shipments of Windows and Windows RT devices increased sharply year on year, although this was largely due to a low base in the previous quarter, which still gave these devices less than 3% of the tablet market in 2Q13.  What companies should do if they&apos;re worried about the iPhone fingerprint hack &gt;&gt; CITEworld Ryan Faas:   But the biggest point about Touch ID in the enterprise organisations is this: It can be disabled [as a login option] across all iOS devices in your organisation with the click of a button using any MDM solution that supports iOS 7.

Why 2013 Is RIM&apos;s BlackBerry Year\u00a0&gt;&gt; Computerworld Rob Enderle, in December 2012:   As we look ahead to 2013, it&apos;s becoming increasingly clear that the new year provides an unprecedented opportunity for Research in Motion to make a huge comeback. This is largely because the market is dominated by two platforms: Android, which is seen as an unsecure malware magnet, and iOS, which comes from a firm that has never learned to spell &quot;IT.&quot; In fact, Apple&apos;s biggest failures were Lisa and the Apple Server, both created on Steve Jobs&apos; watch (Lisa was even his product, initially) and both targeted at the IT market.

A $849 64GB iPhone 5s only costs Apple $218 to build &gt;&gt; ZDNet  According to a teardown analysis carried out analysts at IHS, a top-of-the-line 64GB iPhone 5s, which retails unlocked for $849, costs Apple a mere $218 to build, a price that includes the manufacturing costs. The build price difference between this and the 16GB iPhone 5s is less than $20, and yet Apple charges consumers a whopping $200 for the extra 48GB of storage.

Windows is losing ground among enterprise developers as Android gains &gt;&gt; CITEworld  Appcelerator has queried IT directors, CEOs, development directors, CTOs and people in a number of other roles what their priorities are in the mobile market. The results hint at how the enterprise arena is slipping away from Microsoft, while at the same time acceptance for Android is growing and iOS is the number one priority. As part of the survey, Appcelerator asked the 804 participants how interested they were in developing consumer and enterprise apps for the various mobile platforms. Apple was on top, with 80% saying they were very interested in developing applications for the company&apos;s smartphones and tablets, which is roughly the same response elicited by the first quarter version of the survey. The third-highest priority was Android-based smartphones, which 71% of the respondents said they were very interested in, an increase of 7 percentage points from the first quarter. But unlike Apple, Google and its hardware partners have so far failed to convince enterprises that Android-based tablets are as important as smartphones based on the OS: 59% stated they were very interested, though that was an increase compared to 52% during the first quarter survey. \u2026After that there is a big gap down to Windows-based smartphones and tablets, at 26% and 25%, respectively, compared to 29% and 30% in the first quarter study. To add insult to injury more than 60% thought that Windows 8 would ultimately fail as a mobile platform.

Taiwan market: HTC may lose top-rank title due for lack of new flagship models &gt;&gt; Digitimes  HTC may lose its top-rank title in Taiwan&apos;s smartphone market in the fourth quarter of 2013 as it has failed to deliver a new flagship model for the second half of the year in the local market, while rivals including Samsung Electronics, Sony Mobile Communications and LG Electronics have all released new models, according to sources in the local retail channels. The new flagship models being released recently in the local market include the Galaxy Note 3 from Samsung, the Xperia Z1 from Sony Mobile and the Optimus G2 from LG. All three models are targeting the high-end segment with a price tag of over NT$20,000 (US$676), noted the sources. The competition will become keener at the end of 2013 when Apple begins to market its iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c smartphones in the local market, the sources added.  Taiwan is HTC&apos;s home market.

Nokia Windows Phones win PCMag&apos;s End-user Business Choice Award 2013 &gt;&gt; WMPoweruser  Windows Phones have always scored well when it comes to customer satisfaction, and a new survey published by PCMag finds this satisfaction also carries over into the work place, with business users who use Windows Phones as their primary work phone being much more satisfied with them than Galaxy, iPhone or Blackberry users.  These are scores from end users. No indication of sample sizes (though the blanks for &quot;Technical Support&quot; and &quot;Repairs&quot; indicate fewer than 50 responses - so this might be a small sample).

A spiky assertion of independence, perhaps, or wistful, Japanese-inspired fables? The literary landscape of mainland China has begun to take shape for western readers, but that of Taiwan remains a\u00a0blank \u2013 despite the island&apos;s sophisticated and long-established publishing industry. The English translation of Wu Ming-Yi&apos;s intriguing fourth work of fiction simultaneously plunges the reader into the melting pot of contemporary Taiwanese fiction and refuses any attempt to define it. It is easy to see why Wu&apos;s English-language publishers compare his latest\u00a0novel to the work of Murakami and David Mitchell. His writing occupies the space between hard-edged realism and extravagantly detailed fantasy, hovering over the\u00a0precipice of wild imagination before\u00a0retreating to minutiae about Taiwanese fauna or whale-hunting. Semi-magical events occur throughout the novel: people and animals behave in mysterious ways without quite knowing why they\u00a0are doing so; and, in\u00a0a Murakami-esque touch, there&apos;s even a prominent cat. But beyond these superficial similarities lies an earnest, politically conscious novel, anchored in ecological concerns and Taiwanese identity. The plot is nominally based around two characters: Atile&apos;i, a 15-year-old boy who lives on an untouched island in the South Pacific, and Alice Shih, an\u00a0academic and writer who is considering suicide after years of being haunted by the death of her husband and mysterious disappearance of her son. Atile&apos;i&apos;s world \u2013 the imaginary island of Wayo Wayo \u2013 is established with extraordinary detail, complete with folk legends and sayings, and the customs and traditions of the islanders recounted in long passages. This is underpinned with a seriousness that is mirrored later in the novel, when the focus shifts to the lives of Taiwanese aboriginal people. One of these customs demands that Atile&apos;i, like every second son, is sent to sea, never to return. But Atile&apos;i is swept up by the\u00a0currents and caught in a gigantic trash vortex about to crash on to the eastern coast of Taiwan. The vortex hurls him ashore and brings him into contact with Alice and her small group\u00a0of friends. But the novel, like the trash vortex that threatens to devastate the island, rapidly accumulates plotlines of various shapes and complexity. It draws in other voices and characters, so Alice and Atile&apos;i&apos;s narratives become part of a huge, amorphous story. The flora and fauna of Taiwan play a prominent role. Birdsong, butterflies and bears are lovingly described, as are the mountains that were the beloved domain of Alice&apos;s deceased husband; and there is a constant awareness of the Taiwanese terroir. Nature comes to life in various guises, influencing the other characters and insinuating itself into every twist of the plot. Entwined with this idea of the prominence and fragility of nature are\u00a0the ancient, marginalised but still-proud aboriginal Taiwanese people, represented by Hafay and Dahu. Telling their own stories, they bring true emotional heft to the book. Many\u00a0of the novel&apos;s most moving moments come not from Alice&apos;s predicament, but from Hafay&apos;s struggle to exert her own independence amid the difficulties of modern life. She handles her job as a seedy masseuse with dignity and humour before saving\u00a0enough money to start her own\u00a0modest cafe. Beyond the book&apos;s ecological and\u00a0scientific attributes, you can see a\u00a0deft\u00a0novelist&apos;s hand at work: the Wayo\u00a0Wayoan traditions include wry\u00a0touches such as &quot;feeling the wind\u00a0with the testicles&quot;; and the human encounters \u2013 notably Hafay&apos;s relationships with her clients and\u00a0Alice&apos;s marriage \u2013 are closely observed\u00a0with a wistful melancholy. There may be walking trees, miraculous butterflies and deer that morph into goats, but this is a novel anchored in\u00a0the gritty mess of what it\u00a0means to\u00a0remember and to exist as an\u00a0individual. \u2022 Tash Aw&apos;s Five Star Billionaire is published by Fourth Estate."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/sep/29/jung-chang-wild-swans-empress-cixi", "publicationDate": "2013-09-28T23:05:00Z", "tags": ["Biography", "China", "Books"], "sentences": ["The Chinese edition is published in Hong Kong, sold in Taiwan."], "title": "Jung Chang: 'They should take down Mao's portrait from Tiananmen Square'", "article": "What made you suspect Empress Dowager Cixi was ripe for a biography?When I was writing Wild Swans [Chang&apos;s memoir of three generations of Chinese women], I described my grandmother&apos;s bound feet as &quot;three-inch golden lilies&quot;. I&apos;d assumed foot-binding had been banned by the communists but discovered that it was, in 1902, the Empress Dowager who outlawed it. That got me interested in her. Also, researching my biography of Mao, I was astonished by the freedom he enjoyed growing up [he was born in 1893 when the Empress Dowager was in power \u2013 she died in 1908]. For example, he could travel with a girlfriend, checking into hotels. He had sexual freedom, along with other freedoms that I, growing up in China, couldn&apos;t dream of. There was press freedom too. I had thought the Empress Dowager a diehard conservative despot \u2013 her reputation in China is still as a vicious villain. Why has that hung on?Because as a woman she was not allowed to rule in her own right. She ruled from behind the throne of her son and adopted son. Without research and study, it is not straightforward to decide what her position was. Barely three years after she died, China became a republic. And later Mao and the communists wanted to accuse her of leaving China in a mess. Articulate foes abroad created lies against her. How trapped was she?When she came to power in 1861, China was medieval. She wasn&apos;t allowed to see her officials. She hated the Forbidden City but was not allowed out of it. She wanted to travel. Yet she had the acumen to judge what was possible. She did not let her personal wish for freedom divert her from reforms. She got more radical as she got older\u2026When she came to power she was 25 and from a secluded environment. She didn&apos;t know what the west was like. But she had shrewd judgment. She knew an open-door policy would benefit China \u2013 her greatest contribution. She had an open mind and was attracted to western ways. She was semi-educated but because she hadn&apos;t spent 10 years imbibing incomprehensible classics, her intuitive intelligence wasn&apos;t smothered. You make a fantastic case for her but cannot gloss over her murder of her adopted son. How can this be defensible?That was not the most painful thing. After all, he had plotted to murder her. She realised that if he survived her, China would land in Japan&apos;s lap because they had a hold over him. There would be the nightmare scenario of Japan, which was developing towards being a fascist country, dominating east Asia. It would have been a nightmare for the world \u2013 an incredible moral dilemma. I forgave her this act. How complex was the book to research?In the Forbidden City there are 12 million documents about her and her dynasty. Teams of scholars and archivists have been analysing and digitising them. Her imperial decrees can now be downloaded. I could look at them from the comfort of my study. Will the book be banned in China?If it were, it would be because the regime would not want to promote me. And my conclusions are new, so the book is bound to create waves. But I hope it will be allowed in China. I&apos;m struck by your descriptions of the oppressive order of palace life. To what extent is ordinary feeling repressed by organised Chinese structures?Very repressed. What appalled me was the ban on music. After the emperor&apos;s death there had to be four years of silence \u2013 unbelievable. She loved music. How would you live? There were books but they were classics. When did you move to the UK and how Chinese do you feel now?In 1978. My mother lives in China, and a brother and sister. I care deeply what happens there but London is home. I found things I loved here: flowers, grass, pretty clothes, people being nice to each other. In the Cultural Revolution, people were condemned for saying &quot;thank you&quot; too much \u2013 it was thought bourgeois, as were books. London was freedom and a lovely life. Are clothes important? You dress beautifully\u2026 Yes, they are. But the Empress Dowager would spend two hours dressing up\u2026 and I never\u2026 [she laughs] You worked with your husband on the Mao book. Has it, though banned in China, made an impact there?It is the most fantastic thing: a huge impact. The Chinese edition is published in Hong Kong, sold in Taiwan. Many copies have gone into China. Information from our book is on the web and people are debating it. How did you and your husband meet?In the 1980s I&apos;d finished my doctorate at the University of York and was making a TV series about China. Jon [Halliday, an historian] was working on a documentary about the Korean war. He was told I might open doors in China. I did nothing of the sort. What has your mother&apos;s influence been?My mother is 82 and fearless, which gives me courage. She never cautions me. She lets me do whatever I see as right. And it is courageous because she could be affected by what I do. What one thing would you change in China?Say goodbye to Mao. Take down Mao&apos;s portrait from Tiananmen Square. You were in the Red Guard at 14. Do you feel as if you were another person then?No \u2013 I was very much me. When I go back to China, my schoolfriends say my personality has hardly changed. I never was a fanatic. Extreme actions make me afraid. I was a reluctant Red Guard. Like the Empress Dowager, I was radical but no extremist. It sounds like you identify with her\u2026I admire her for bringing off an incredible revolution in China with minimum bloodshed. I empathise with her.

The Treasury said there were no plans to develop a UK sovereign wealth fund to rival the \u00a315bn French and \u00a3875m Italian government funds, though the local government minister, Eric Pickles, is consulting on whether to create a &quot;superfund&quot; from the UK&apos;s assorted state pension schemes, which have amassed almost \u00a3200bn in assets. There are 89 local government pension schemes, with around \u00a3150bn under management; several others, including the Royal Mail pension scheme and the fund for MPs&apos; pensions, have built up assets from investments in shares and bonds. However, pension funds are excluded from the list of sovereign wealth funds, which are expected to generate wealth for the nation as a whole. Thomas said that, with a change in the law lifting restrictions that limit it to property and land in Britain, the crown estate could become a sovereign wealth fund and develop its investment strategy. Last year the estate generated a surplus of \u00a3253m from its investments after making an 11.9% annual return. The bedrock of the estate is the Prince Regent&apos;s London property holdings, built 200 years ago, which run from Regent&apos;s Park through Oxford Circus and Regent Street to St James&apos;s Park. Seabeds managed by the estate are leased to offshore windfarms, and land across the UK is home to many other renewable energy schemes, business parks and factories. The fund was boosted last year by the acquisition of the Coliseum shopping park, in Cheshire, and Silverlink shopping park, outside Newcastle. Lifting restrictions on the estate would, Thomas said, allow it &quot;to begin to explore ventures into overseas property markets, for example in the Asian Pacific region, where eight of the world&apos;s largest 20 property markets are located, including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and India, or taking a stake in companies set up to bring new technologies to market&quot;. Most of the largest funds rely on oil and other commodity revenues to boost their assets under management. Norway already has a \u00a3460bn sovereign wealth fund generated from taxes on its oil and gas industry. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and China have also amassed huge wealth in funds that have become active investors in foreign markets, including the UK. It is estimated that government-backed funds account for around $30tr (\u00a318.5tr) of global assets, the same as the estimated $30tr of pension funds&apos; assets. Since the beginning of 2008, which marks the high point for most stock and bond markets, funds registered with the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute have increased their assets by 59%. Much of the gain is from oil and gas revenues, which soared after the eurozone crisis caused a wholesale price rise.

Stefano De Sabbata and Dr Mark Graham from the Oxford Internet Institute have tried to show this with a map visualising each country&apos;s most popular website using a design that pays homage to the Age of Empires video game series. You can click on the map below to zoom in and see the countries in detail. There is a key showing the websites featured at the bottom left of the map.       The researchers explain their methodology on their Information Geographies blog:  The map uses freely available data retrieved from Alexa on August 12th, 2013. The company has provided website analytics since 1996. Alexa collects data from millions of internet users using one of over 25,000 different browser extensions, and the data used for this visualization were calculated &quot;using a combination of the estimated average daily unique visitors to a site and the estimated number of pageviews on that site from users in that country over the past month&quot;. The data are visualised as a choropleth map, where the colour indicates each country&apos;s most visited website. Starting from the evident dominance of two companies (Google and Facebook), whose colours (red and blue, respectively) cover most of the map, we styled the illustration as an old colonial map, and named it after the computer game series Age of Empires.  The age of internet empires So Google and Facebook rule most of the world except Asia where local providers have managed to maintain their domination of the market.  The researchers point out that Google is the most visited website in the majority of European, North American and Oceanian countries while Facebook dominates in the Middle East, North Africa and most Spanish-speaking countries in South America. The once dominant Yahoo! maintains a stronghold in Japan, where it is branded Yahoo Japan! (as a joint venture with Japanese company SoftBank) and also in Taiwan. Unfortunately there are some countries missing from the map, as the researchers explain:  Alexa does not provide much information about countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, most countries that have a significant Internet population are covered. Kenya, Madagascar, Nigeria, and South Africa fall within the sphere of Google&apos;s empire, whereas Ghana, Senegal, and Sudan have been subsumed within Facebook&apos;s dominion.  Size is not everything The countries where Google is dominant contain half of the internet&apos;s whole population, with over one billion users.  Although the locations it dominates contain more landmass, Facebook loses out to Chinese search engine Baidu when it comes to total internet population. To illustrate this discrepancy De Sabbata and Graham have also displayed the data on a map where countries are sized by internet population.

Given that the IMF has been delivering pretty sober assessments for more than four years now, it&apos;s not that surprising. This time the outlook also involved a bit of looking back at how good things were expected to be before the GFC/great recession hit, and how bad they were predicted to be once it did. What is striking is that for many countries and parts of the world, 2013 finds them in a worse position than where they were expected to be in April 2009 when the IMF issued its first bleak outlook after the tumult of the GFC. So while there has been some joy in the UK because the IMF has revised its prediction for growth in 2013 from the meagre 0.7% expected in the April WEO up to 1.4%, it is worth remembering that back in April 2009 the IMF expected the UK to be growing about 2.8% by now. For the next three years it kept revising down that prediction. Only in the past year has the IMF been too pessimistic:      For Australia, the reverse is true. If we look at the predictions for GDP growth from 2007 onwards, the IMF in 2008, before the GFC hit, was rather buoyant about Australia&apos;s future. It expected by the end of 2013 Australia&apos;s economy would have grown 20% above where it was in 2007. When the GFC hit, the IMF got real gloomy and revised this down to a mere 9.2%. And yet on Wednesday the IMF reported Australia&apos;s economy growing by 16% since 2007.      In fact, if you look at a comparison of where the IMF expected advanced economies to be by 2014 when the GFC hit and where they are now, Australia has performed better than all but Singapore, Taiwan and Israel:      Countries like Korea and China have grown faster than Australia, but they were expected to do so. Back in April 2009 the IMF expected Australia, the US and Canada to get through the GFC with much the same growth, but only Australia performed above expectations. So Australia has gone through the GFC much better than expected, but interestingly back in 2010 the IMF thought we would be in better shape than we are now. Moreover, the latest outlook has revised down the estimate for Australia&apos;s GDP growth in 2014 from its April estimate of 3.3% to 2.8%. Similarly, it has changed its expectations of our unemployment. In April it thought unemployment in 2014 would reach 5.2%, now it says 6.0% is the more likely outcome. Treasurer Joe Hockey noted this increase, saying, &quot;Worryingly, the IMF forecasts Australia&apos;s unemployment rate to rise from 5.6 per cent in 2013 to 6.0 per cent in 2014.&quot; As Michael Pascoe observed, however, the IMF&apos;s forecast on unemployment is actually rather more optimistic than that of the Treasury, which in the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook predicted unemployment to reach 6.25% by June 2014.  So there are ups and downs to the outlook, but there certainly are risks looking ahead. Rather as Australia&apos;s economy has experienced transition, so, too, has the world economy. The IMF notes that while most advanced economies are gradually strengthening, &quot;at the same time growth in emerging market economies has slowed&quot;. For Australia this slowing is particularly important. The report estimates that the slowdown of Chinese growth from an average of 10% during the previous decade to an average of 7.5% over the coming decade will reduce Australia&apos;s revenue in exports by about 3% of GDP over that time. This makes us second only to China&apos;s neighbour, Mongolia, in exposure to a Chinese slowdown. And slow down China has. In the past three years the IMF has reduced its expectations for China&apos;s growth in 2014 from 9.5% to 8.5% to 7.3%. It now only predicts annual growth each year till 2018 to be 7.0%. How low is that? Well it hasn&apos;t been that low since 1990.      So the struggles lie ahead for Australia, and for those hoping relief might come from a lower dollar and a boost to our manufacturing sector, the news is not great either. The IMF suggests the &quot;US recovery is set to accelerate&quot; \u2013 though this assumes &quot;the shutdown is short, discretionary public spending is approved and executed as assumed in the forecast and the debt ceiling is raised promptly&quot;.  Even with these somewhat risky assumptions it predicts the US Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates until 2016. And until that happens it is unlikely our dollar will fall to anywhere near the long-term average of 80 US cents."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/10/pc-sales-slump-enters-sixth-quarter-with-no-end-in-sight", "publicationDate": "2013-10-10T09:16:43Z", "tags": ["Computing", "Software", "Windows", "Tablet computers", "iPad", "Technology"], "sentences": ["Trouble in Taiwan For Taiwan&apos;s Asus and Acer, the quarter brought more bad news, with their shipments declining substantially - by a third compared to last year according to IDC, and 20% according to Gartner."], "title": "PC sales slump enters sixth quarter with no end in sight", "article": "The PC industry shows no sign of coming out of its slump, which now extends for a record six straight quarters of decline - and could continue into 2014, analysts say.The research group Gartner says that in the third quarter, to the end of September, shipments of PCs (defined as computers with a permanently attached keyboard)\u00a0fell by 8.6% year-on-year to 80.28m, while another research group, IDC\u00a0put the drop at 7.6% to 81.61m. IDC expects no relief in the fourth quarter, forecasting that the figure there will be 83.1m - down 5% from 87.5m in the comparative period in 2012. The companies think that 2014 could mark the low point, and that PC sales might stop dropping in 2015 as older PCs are finally replaced. However Gartner reckons it would see no better than single-digit growth even then.     IDC/Gartner average of PC shipments, Q1 1999 to Q3 2013, in millions. Photograph: /Guardian    At the same time, analysts now think that sales of tablets (including Microsoft&apos;s Surface and formats with detachable keyboards) will for the first time overtake those of PCs next quarter - a dramatic rise for a category which only began to take off when sales of the iPad began in the second quarter of 2010. Preliminary IDC estimates suggest that just 49m tablets shipped worldwide in the third quarter - but Christmas is expected to bring a surge in buying, helped by new products from Apple, Google and even retail vendors including Tesco. The shift is part of a structural change that is hitting the PC industry, which has effectively hit saturation in the west and where buyers in developing countries, particularly in Asia, appear to be opting for smartphones and tablets as a first computing device. That is putting pressure on companies which rely only on PCs and do not have a smartphone or tablet strategy as those markets see explosive growth.     Significant events in the PC market's development: previous Windows launches saw dips. Photograph: /Guardian    Consumers are also holding onto PCs for longer as they see less improvement in processing power or battery life, and less need for it. Trouble in Taiwan For Taiwan&apos;s Asus and Acer, the quarter brought more bad news, with their shipments declining substantially - by a third compared to last year according to IDC, and 20% according to Gartner. The three large PC companies, Lenovo, HP and Dell, all tightened their grip on the business as purchasing shifted away from consumers and towards businesses; but only Lenovo saw even minimal growth, of over 2%, in shipments. IDC said Acer was hit by weak consumer spending; Asus, by a lack of corporate buyers. Continuing upgrades of older commercial systems which were running Windows XP, and are now being replaced with versions mostly running Windows 7, is keeping the business side of purchasing healthy. But consumers are effectively staying away. The prospect of new PCs based on Intel&apos;s new low-power Haswell chips, and the release of Microsoft&apos;s 8.1 update to its Windows software, may help sales to consumers in the next quarter. Both Gartner and IDC&apos;s figures include Apple shipments. Using an estimated 6% decline in Apple&apos;s worldwide computer shipments - the same as its last quarter - suggests that the Windows PC market declined by 8.7%.     Windows PC shipments (excluding Apple), Q1 1999 to Q3 2013. Figures for Q3 2013 estimated on -6% growth for Apple year-on-year, the same as the previous quarter. Photograph: /Guardian    IDC had expected worse overall PC figures for the quarter - it forecast a 9.5% decline - but Loren Loverde, its vice-president for PC tracking, remarked that even so the figure &quot;doesn&apos;t reflect much improvement in the PC market, or potential for near-term growth&quot;. Consumers are still putting off PC purchases and replacements, Loverde said: &quot;the third quarter results suggest that there&apos;s still a high probability that we will see another decline in worldwide shipments in 2014.&quot; Back to school... but not with a PC At Gartner, principal analyst Mikako Kitagawa commented that despite the third quarter usually being described as the &quot;back-to-school&quot; quarter - when adults buy new machines for children beginning secondary school or university - &quot;sales this quarter dropped to their lowest volume since 2008&quot;. The regional picture shows that the US market may have bottomed out, while that in China - once the largest growth market - has still stalled in the face of growing purchases there of new tablets and smartphones. Gartner reckoned that shipments to the US market grew 3.5%, to 16.1m, while IDC reckoned it shrank slightly, by 0.2%, to 16.4m. In the Europe/Middle East/Africa, both Gartner and IDC said the market shrank: Gartner put the market size at 22.4m, or about a quarter of the world total. \u2022 How the smartphone is killing the PC \u2022 PC boom is over as tablets and smartphones take over, says IDC"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/14/htc-one-max-fingerprint-scanner-low-end", "publicationDate": "2013-10-14T14:25:13Z", "tags": ["HTC", "Technology", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Taiwan"], "sentences": ["HTC, the troubled Taiwanese smartphone maker, will continue competing at the high end against companies such as Apple and Samsung, insists its global online communications manager.", "Separately, Appledaily, a Taiwanese website, suggested\u00a0that the company is in talks with China&apos;s Lenovo about &quot;strategic cooperation&quot; after secret meetings in Taiwan during August, and that a deal of some sort could be concluded by the first half of 2014.", "But there would be political obstacles to a takeover of HTC by a Chinese company, because of the longstanding differences between Taiwan, which has never recognised the mainland Chinese leadership as legitimate."], "title": "HTC will stay out of low-end market, manager insists, as new One Max promises fingerprint scanner", "article": "HTC, the troubled Taiwanese smartphone maker, will continue competing at the high end against companies such as Apple and Samsung, insists its global online communications manager.

The sensor can be used to open three different apps, triggered by different fingers. The HTC One Max has a 5.9in screen, and is being released in China ahead of the US. That is seen as indicative of the company&apos;s attempts to reach a broader market, and a break with the past given that in 2010 HTC was the biggest Android brand in the US. But it still faces an uphill task in breaking through there, because it has a tiny market share and is competing with Android smartphones in a market which is highly price-sensitive. Separately, Appledaily, a Taiwanese website, suggested\u00a0that the company is in talks with China&apos;s Lenovo about &quot;strategic cooperation&quot; after secret meetings in Taiwan during August, and that a deal of some sort could be concluded by the first half of 2014. Lenovo, the world&apos;s largest PC seller, also has ambitions in the smartphone market, though it has mostly focussed on its Chinese home market so far.\u00a0 But there would be political obstacles to a takeover of HTC by a Chinese company, because of the longstanding differences between Taiwan, which has never recognised the mainland Chinese leadership as legitimate. HTC is likely to need some sort of help if its problems persist. It fell to a NT$3.5bn (\u00a373m) loss in the third quarter, its first loss in more than ten years, as sales dropped by a third to NT$47.05bn (about \u00a31bn), as its smartphone shipments slumped to an estimated 6m - which would give it about 2.3% of the world smartphone business. It faces serious challenges in trying to compete against Apple and Samsung, which have products which dominate the high end of the smartphone business, which is generally splitting towards a high- and low-end market, with minimal business in the middle end between about $300 and $400.     The HTC One has struggled to make an impact in the high-end field despite good reviews. Photograph: Ashley Pon/Bloomberg via Getty Images    The company was also obliged to put out a\u00a0clarification on its site\u00a0after an interview on Bloomberg TV in which its chairwoman, Cher Wang, appeared to say that the company faced &quot;its most challenging&quot; quarter in the current three months. Wang, the company insisted, was referring to &quot;living up to the challenge of innovative marketing in Q4 of 2013. She puts direct communications with [the] consumer at the center of [HTC&apos;s] overall business strategy.&quot; Meanwhile Gordon,\u00a0on Twitter, insisted that &quot;HTC will not suddenly shift strategy to become a budget smartphone maker.&quot; He\u00a0added\u00a0that &quot;running to [the] low end would be the exact wrong solution&quot; to the company&apos;s present problems. Gordon suggested that Chinese companies which are coming to the wider market are operating at the low-profit end of the market - one into which even Amazon is expected to make a move. &quot;Competing against Huawei, ZTE, eventually Amazon, etc for [the] low end [on] razor-thin margins is a fool&apos;s game,&quot; he\u00a0said. Gordon was reacting to the suggestion by\u00a0Tero Kuittinen, an analyst at Alekstra, that with LG, ZTE and Huawei now shipping more than 12m phones per quarter, &quot;HTC will face crushing price competition&quot;. Kuittinen suggested that &quot;It is entirely unrealistic to expect HTC, which has obsessively focused on the $600 price point, to suddenly become competitive at below $150.

PDA/mobile device comparison / chooser &gt;&gt; Steve Litchfield  The idea here is to score most current PDA/smartphone solutions and see which one comes out on top. The scores for each criteria are my own personal evaluations. You can apply your own weightings, though, and the page will multiply everything up and work out your most suitable smartphone solution. Models and scores: (10=excellent, 1=terrible). Weightings: &apos;Not&apos;/&apos;Quite&apos;/&apos;Very&apos; multiplies scores by 0, 1 or 2 respectively.  Quite fun, though it would be better - as in more honest - if you couldn&apos;t see the matrix of offerings while you&apos;re choosing. Needs lots of browser width, so maybe not one for the phone. HTC One max review: a lot more of the same &gt;&gt; The Verge Vlad Savov:   Using the One max in the recommended way \u2014 as a very generously proportioned phone \u2014 is an exercise in frustration, and nothing exemplifies that better than its major new feature, the fingerprint scanner. Firstly, it&apos;s placed in exactly the wrong place. Sitting immediately below the camera lens and requiring a swipe, it pretty much compels you to smudge the lens every time you want to identify yourself. The need for a vertical swipe is also problematic, since your hand&apos;s natural position is at an angle to the sensor, demanding an unnatural and uncomfortable motion to activate it. Inevitably, that leads to regular failures to recognise your epidermic signature. Equally enervating is the fact that you have to wake the One max from sleep before swiping to unlock it. The whole point of these fingerprint sensors is to speed up security processes, not make them more finicky, and that&apos;s exactly where the HTC One max fails.  And though you can enrol three different fingers to launch three different apps, that only works from the lockscreen - not anywhere else. Savov says the scanner is &quot;clumsy, awkward, and comfortably in line with the long history of failed attempts at making this technology work.&quot; Fake traffic is causing a crisis for advertisers &gt;&gt; Adweek  A few weeks ago, Lindsay Buescher, senior manager, analytics at Carat, read an article on Adweek.com about a company called FreeStreams.com that was pumping up its traffic by enticing Web users into accidentally visiting via hidden links on sites that house pirated content. As it happened, one of her agency&apos;s clients, Red Bull, was a FreeStreams advertiser. Buescher was determined to find out what was going on. Her team discovered Red Bull video ads were running on FreeStreams through two different networks, including ValueClick, a publicly traded company. (ValueClick says it has since stopped working with FreeStreams.) That wasn&apos;t something Buescher had run into much. She kept digging. After about three weeks, Carat was blacklisting 77 more sites for Red Bull beyond FreeStreams. Many of the sites didn&apos;t actually sell pre-roll ads, which was what the client was supposedly paying for. Some were merely gaming sites with interstitials.

Maybe what we need is less fake advertising content. iPhone 5s outselling iPhone 5c two-to-one &gt;&gt; AllThingsD  According to CIRP&apos;s survey of U.S. consumers who purchased Apple&apos;s latest iPhones during the last days of September, the 5s accounted for 64% of total iPhone sales following its launch that month. Meanwhile, the the 5c accounted for 27%, with the legacy iPhone 4S making up the remaining 9%. So not only is the 5s outselling the 5c, it&apos;s outselling it more than two to one. Welcome news for Apple, since cannibalization of the 5s by the 5c was a potential commercial risk for this iPhone cycle. CIRP&apos;s data suggests that the company has so far avoided it \u2014 though that&apos;s hardly surprising at this early stage. After all, the iPhone 5c was intended as a mainstream smartphone, the iPhone 5s as an enthusiast one \u2014 a &quot;forward-thinking&quot; device for forward-thinking folks. And enthusiasts are often early adopters.  In fact, the sales split seems to have been almost exactly the same as the 5/4S split a year ago - except the 5c is doing slightly better (though probably within the margin of sampling error).  Learning from Blackberry&apos;s Decline &gt;&gt; Tech-Thoughts Sameer Singh:   There is a tendency among industry watchers to gauge the future of a company based on feedback from the company&apos;s best customers. Unfortunately, the highest or most demanding tiers of a customer base are often the worst judges of an established company&apos;s prospects. While Blackberry&apos;s business was being disrupted by the iPhone and Android smartphones, their core &quot;enterprise&quot; and &quot;prosumer&quot; markets remained fiercely loyal. Many analysts remained steadfast in their opinion that Blackberry&apos;s core customer base would ensure the company&apos;s relevance in the years to come. The problem with the &quot;best&quot; customers is that they provide no information about the dominant basis of competition in the industry, i.e. the mainstream market. Blackberry&apos;s core user base always held the opinion that their email/messaging services and hardware keyboard gave the company a sustainable competitive advantage over competitors. Unfortunately, while industry watchers were preoccupied with those features, the basis of competition in the mainstream market shifted to ease of use, availability of apps, full featured browsing, etc.  Google CIO Ben Fried on how Google works &gt;&gt; AllThingsD  Google employees themselves live in a bit of a cocoon of Google products, using mostly Android phones and tablets, with near-perfect Wi-Fi and cellular service, and with limited flexibility to try other companies&apos; productivity applications. It&apos;s a privileged existence, and perhaps one that gives them less of an ability to relate to their customers and be exposed to new and exciting things. There are very good reasons for the cocoon: Google is a huge company, with a ton of highly sensitive and confidential information about its own strategy and operations, and that of its five-million-plus Google Apps enterprise productivity suite\u00a0customers. Google can&apos;t be cavalier about security, and it can&apos;t let its employees take too many risks. It takes time and effort to make nifty new apps appropriate for the enterprise, and someone has to oversee that.  Dropbox: banned. Fantastical (a calendaring app): banned. Windows PC: requires permission from a manager. Microsoft Office: requires permission. Own laptops: banned (except Chromebooks). The picture that emerges of the Google internal monoculture is fascinating. No bids in 700 MHz auction, Paulwell disappointed &gt;&gt; JamaicaObserver.com  Despite a robust showing of interest from a number of entities, including the 24 persons from 10 countries, including India, China, Ghana, Japan, Canada, Taiwan, the Russian Federation and the United States who attended a public forum for interested parties via the internet, the auction ended with no bids submitted before the 2:00 pm deadline. &quot;We view this as a minor setback,&quot; [said Phillip Paulwell, Jamaica&apos;s minister for science, technology, energy and mining].

In fact toilet-themed restaurants are nothing new \u2013 Taiwans&apos; Modern Toilet where chocolate ice-cream is served in toilet-shaped dishes is well-documented. Inspired by its success Magic Restroom owner YoYo Li has introduced toilets as seats and a mix of Asian and western food \u2013 like zha jiang mian, named &quot;constipation&quot; on the menu, braised pork over rice, (&quot;smells-like-poop&quot;), and sundaes (choose from chocolate &quot;black poop&quot; or the vanilla-strawberry sundae &quot;bloody number two&quot;) served, of course, in miniature toilet bowls. Revolting and distrubing in equal measure. Freud would have a field day. Isabel Choat  Twin Stars Diner, Moscow     Photograph: Reuters TV / Reuters/Reuters    It&apos;s hard to stand out in a city that loves extreme dining, whether it involves vines and amphorae, (Tiflis, the Russian word for the Georgian capital, Tbilisi), moving trams (Annushka), live goats (Shinok), or waterfalls (Blue Elephant) \u2013 but Alexei Khodorkovsky has managed to find a new niche, with the opening of his twin-themed restaurant. At the Twin Stars diner in Moscow, all the staff \u2013 from waiters to bartenders and even the chefs \u2013 are identically-dressed twins. The creepy concept is inspired by a 1964 Soviet film in which a girl winds up in an alternate reality and confronts her twin. Khodorkovsky says it&apos;s been hard to find suitably qualifed twins but the concept is paying off - the 24-hour restaurant is a hit with locals who don&apos;t seem bothered about the issue of whether or not to tip twice.  If Twin Stars represents the new Russia with its modern, funky design, the Expedicia is more traditional Russia - appealing, one imagines, to chest-beating Putin types with a love of the outdoors. In the pricey, survival-themed Expeditsia (&quot;expedition&quot;) restaurant you eat between an orange helicopter parked in the pine trees and a stuffed polar bear scratching itself by a stream. Guests can sprawl on the roof garden lawn or be beaten with birch twigs in the Siberian banya. Ingredients such as wild duck, fresh berries and mountain honey are flown in from the far north and east of Russia, and delicacies include elk in aspic, smoked venison, sea urchin and sturgeon, served with vodka, sea buckthorn juice or Baikal mineral water. Expect to pay around 1,500 roubles (\u00a330) for a main course; a shot of vodka will set you back around \u00a35 and a fresh juice \u00a39. \u2022 expedicia.ruPhoebe Taplin and Isabel Choat Carton King, Taichung City, Taiwan Taiwan has a penchant for themed absurdity when it comes to eating out. Whether for Japanese assassins lurking in the rafters at Ninja or the drinks served in specimen bottles to wash down one&apos;s turd-shaped bread at the aforementioned Modern Toilet, the food is rarely the primary draw. And so it is with Carton King, a restaurant whose owner was so depressed by the preponderance of plastic in modern life he built an eatery which, instead, promotes the virtues of corrugated cardboard. From the chairs to the plates and even the walls \u2013 the whole place is bedecked in the brown stuff. The food, although not fine dining, was more than edible and all that remained of our stewed pork ribs and herb-roasted chicken was the odd greasy smear on our cardboard table.

So the only surprise about Taipei&apos;s Barbie restaurant is that it took so long for someone to come up with the idea. It is staffed by waitresses in bright pink tops, tutus and tiaras, while the chairs are dressed in tutus and there&apos;s enough pink food to sink a Barbie cruise ship. IC Le Refuge des Fondues, Paris Why, when in Paris, a city full of great restaurants, you would choose to go for a fondue is anyone&apos;s guess but tucking into the Swiss dish is not the oddest thing about Le Refuge des Fondues in Monmatre. The real weirdness begins when you order your wine \u2013 and it&apos;s brought to you in a baby&apos;s bottle, apparently a ruse to avoid French tax on wine served in proper glasses. Gooey cheese and drinking out of a teat \u2013 it&apos;s not somewhere you&apos;d want to go on a first date, but it&apos;s been pulling in the tourist crowds for decades.  \u2022 17 Rue des 3 Fr\u00e8res IC The Royal Dragon, Bangkok, Thailand          If you think Britain&apos;s biggest restaurant, serving 2,000 diners a day, is massive, think again. Bangkok&apos;s Royal Dragon is monumental. The colossal seafood place sprawls across 8.35 acres, has 1,000 staff, and requires 540 costumed waiters on roller skates to serve some 5,000 customers. And while it boasts the largest collection of live seafood tanks and 1,000 pan-Asian dishes, diners don&apos;t come for the food. It&apos;s all about the spectacle: traditional Thai and Chinese music, dance and martial arts shows, and waiters walking on water and &quot;flying&quot; through the air on zip-wires. Watch what you order if you choose live seafood (it is priced by weight and can be expensive), so there are no surprises \u2013 other than the waiters falling from the sky, that is. The dim sum buffet and set menus are the best value. Service can be slow despite the wheels and wires, making the experience best done with a group of (well-lubricated) friends.royal-dragon.comLara Dunston The Heart Attack Grill, Las Vegas, US     Photograph: Alamy    We all know Americans love big portions. The Heart Attack Grill in Vegas (where else?) celebrates the fact with gusto by serving obscenely huge burgers with sides of fries deep-fried in lard. Diners are given hospital style gowns before tucking into the likes of a quadruple bypass burger, a towering heart attack on a plate made with four beef patties and 20 slices of bacon, served by waitresses dressed as nurses who will help you out of the restaurant in a wheel chair if necessary. If you are prepared to gamble with your health, the Heart Attack Grill is certainly a meal to remember. \u2022 heartattackgrill.com IC Draculas and Witches in Britches, Melbourne, Australia     Witches in Britches, Melbourne    Two longstanding Melbourne schlock horror-themed theatre restaurants owe their recent resurgence in popularity to the Twilight phenomenon, the current obsession with vampires, witches and werewolves, and the burlesque craze. Claiming to have served three million people in 30 years, Draculas offers a camp, vaudevillian-style cabaret during a three-course dinner that begins with drinks in the Graveyard cocktail lounge and a ghost-train ride.\u00a0 Located in the Wicked Castle, the 40-year old Witches in Britches offers a kitschy interactive show rooted in contemporary pop culture (it helps to have some knowledge of Aussie television) and a five-course meal that starts with pumpkin soup with &quot;herbs picked from the old hag&apos;s garden&quot;, ladled from a cauldron. \u2022 draculas.com.au, witchesinbritches.com.au  LD Onkel Taa, Italian Tyrol     Karl Platino, owner-chef of Onkel Taa    Hidden away in a tiny village of the Italian Tyrol, Onkel Taa is a gourmet restaurant serving traditional Mitteleuropa cuisine, but it is also the fantasy world of the owner-chef, Karl Platino. He is known in Italy as &quot;Il Re delle Lumache&quot;, the Snail King, because not only does he serve a dozen dishes featuring snails, he also breeds these molluscs in the jungle-like gardens surrounding the restaurant. And this is only one of Onkel Taa&apos;s passions: the decor of the cosy wood-panelled osteria is filled with his weird and wonderful collections \u2013 everything from corkscrews to snail shaped fossils; and a whole museum is dedicated to the Habsurg Empire and Emperor Franz Josef in particular, whom, coincidentally, the chef closely resembles. And if you want to see something really special, ask to go upstairs from the dining room, where Signor Platino has over a thousand incredible antique wooden doors stashed away.\u2022 bad-egart.comJohn Brunton Soldatenkaffee, Bandung, Indoneisa          And the award for most tastless restaurant goes to ... the Soldatenkaffee in Bandung, Indonesia. Celebrating &quot;Hitler as pop culture&quot; it is staffed by waiters in Nazi uniform. On the menu are &quot;German&quot; nachos, curry wurst and &quot;Bird Ness&quot;, whatever that is; and on the walls are photos of Hitler, stormtroopers and swastikas. Owner Henry Mulyana seemed genuinely surprised at the outrage the restaurant caused, insisting that he doesn&apos;t idolise Hitler, he &quot;simply adores the soldier&apos;s paraphernalia&quot;, a message he emphasises on his website: &quot;This WEB is not pro NAZI. It is matter of fact, with the intention of exploring Hitler &amp; the NAZIS as pop culture. The authors of the WEB are not NAZIS or neo-NAZIS, we are Indonesian with no political affiliations&quot;. The furore caused by Soldatenkaffee didn&apos;t put off another owner opening the equally offensive Hitler Fried Chicken in Bangkok, a bizarre take on KFC, with an image of Hitler replacing that of Colonel Sanders. The runner-up prize for most tasteless restaurant goes to Bunga Bunga in Battersea, London. It&apos;s hard to fathom anyone wanting to eat in a restaurant themed around a slimy, criminal fraudster famed for his liaisons with underaged prostitutes, but here it is, the shameless Bunga Bunga, which draws crowds of young Chelsea types with its all-you-can-drink prosecco and bellini parties.

According to people familiar with the project talking to the FT, Amazon and HTC have three devices on their product roadmap, with one likely to be released in 2014. Amazon has long been rumoured to be working on a smartphone to pair with its Kindle Fire range of Android tablets to compete with offerings from Google and Apple. HTC risks expulsion from Google&apos;s OHA If HTC has worked with with Amazon to produce a &quot;forked&quot; version of Google&apos;s Android operating system on the phones, then it could face expulsion from the Open Handset Alliance (OHA) - a consortium of mobile phone makers and networks whose stated purpose is to &quot;accelerate innovation in mobile and offer consumers a richer, less expensive, and better mobile experience&quot;. As part of the OHA, HTC gains free access to Google\u2019s Android software. It also means HTC can gain Google certification for its Android devices allowing them to come pre-loaded with access to Google Play and its 850,000 standard Android apps, as well as Google\u2019s Android app suite, which includes Chrome, Gmail, Calendar, Maps and Search.\u00a0 Amazon &quot;forked&quot; Android to produce the software powering its Kindle Fire tablets in 2012, so that they would access its own app store, not Google&apos;s. The Kindle Fire range uses Microsoft&apos;s Bing for its search engine, maps from Nokia, and its own Silk browser.\u00a0 Previous attempts by another OHA member, Acer, to produce a smartphone with a different variant of Android produced by China\u2019s Alibaba, resulted in a clash with Google which saw Acer abruptly pull out of its partnership with Alibaba. For HTC, which dipped to a heavy loss in the third quarter, the threat of being forced out of the OHA could be double-edged. It is losing ground in the Android space in the west to Samsung&apos;s larger marketing spend and phone range, and has set its sights on China - where Google&apos;s Android is used on only a tiny percentage of smartphone handsets, most of which run the Android Open Source Platform (AOSP) without Google services.\u00a0 Back to its roots Founded in 1997 in Taiwan, HTC started life designing and manufacturing devices, such as mobile phones and PDAs based on Microsoft\u2019s Windows Mobile operating system, for distribution by mobile phone operators like Orange in the UK as own-brand products.

He already has more than 270,000 followers. And that&apos;s just one of the surprising stats around the social networking app, which is still seen by many Westerners as that messaging app that&apos;s huge in Japan. That&apos;s only partly true. Line is certainly huge, having signed up more than 260m users since its launch two years ago, with 160m of them having registered in 2013 so far. But the app is about more than instant messaging: it&apos;s a fully-fledged social network, complete with its own games platform and ambitions to move into music and shopping. It&apos;s also not just big in Japan. &quot;80% of our traffic is from outside Japan. People consider it to be more Asian, but now it&apos;s a different story,&quot; says Sunny Kim, senior vice president and head of business development for Line Euro-Americas, before reeling off some figures to prove it. &quot;We&apos;ve got 17m users in Taiwan, 18m in Thailand, 14m in Indonesia, but now also 15m in Spain, and we expect to have more than 10m users in Mexico and other Latin American countries this year. And now we think it&apos;s time to enter more high-profile countries like the UK.&quot; That&apos;s the reason for Kim&apos;s visit to London: Line&apos;s apps are already available here on various smartphones, but the company is planning a proper launch in the coming months, signing up more celebrities and brands \u2013\u00a0McCartney isn&apos;t a bad start on that front \u2013\u00a0and getting local designers to create digital stickers that will appeal to Brits. Stickers? They&apos;re another intriguing element to Line&apos;s growth. In August, the company said it was making more than $10m a month selling stickers in its apps, with people able to use them as richer emoticons when messaging friends. Some are based on big stars or brands \u2013\u00a0Barcelona and Real Madrid have their own Line sticker ranges in Spain \u2013\u00a0while others are based on Line&apos;s own characters, who are so popular in Japan that they have their own TV cartoon called Line Town. &quot;People know all about chatting apps, so they want to know what&apos;s different. And when they first install Line, it&apos;s the stickers: they&apos;re very cute, and when you start to use them in chatting, it&apos;s really addictive,&quot; says Kim. &quot;In Spain, people were very excited about the [Lionel] Messi stickers for example. But then they discover our photo-sharing features, and then Line games. So people discover our functions step by step.&quot; Earlier this year, comScore estimated that Spain had 24m smartphone users, so the fact that 15m people there have at least registered for Line is impressive. Football clubs may also be high on the company&apos;s priority list for partners in the UK, as it hopes for similar growth here. More stats? Line says that in July, it had 73m unique monthly users worldwide of its app&apos;s Facebook-style Home and Timeline features, and that 7bn messages were being sent every day using the app in August, including 1bn stickers. Line&apos;s games business is also growing at a rapid pace, and shaping up as a genuine alternative to Facebook as a platform for developers to build social games on. Kim says that there are now more than 36 games on Line, which have collectively generated more than 190m downloads. Initially, Line made its games in-house using its own characters, basing the gameplay on popular casual genres, from bubble-popping to gem-swapping. Line Pop and Line Bubble have been downloaded 33m and 25m times respectively. &quot;We are opening up our platform to third-party game studios, and depending on the markets, we are inviting local studios,&quot; says Kim.     Line's games include Line Bubble and Line Pop with 25m and 33m downloads respectively    Line has numerous rivals in the messaging/social space, from Korean firm Kakao \u2013\u00a0which has a similar mix of social features and games platform \u2013 through to Western messaging apps like WhatsApp, and on to bigger beasts of the social networking world like Facebook (which is also getting into stickers) and Twitter. WhatsApp announced this week that it now has 350m monthly active users, and it seems to be the company most in Line&apos;s sights, judging by some of Kim&apos;s comments, from her claim that Spanish people were &quot;a little tired of WhatsApp&quot; when Line launched there, to her description of it as a &quot;first-generation&quot; app whose market share in Asia is &quot;meaningless&quot;. &quot;No one uses WhatsApp there, but we know that every market is different: France is strong for Facebook Messenger for example,&quot; says Kim. &quot;The market is open for competition: we always know that the next month, some new service can change this market.&quot; Relationships with celebrities and brands will be important: as well as signing them up, Line is trying to educate them in how best to use its app, how that differs from Facebook and Twitter, and what kind of data they can get back in return. &quot;They&apos;re not just counting the clicks. People sending messages to Line users can watch on a real-time basis how many users open the message, and how long they played the video for,&quot; says Kim. &quot;Then next time, they can adapt their message based on the learnings from the previous one. It&apos;s a very advanced marketing tool for them. And for famous singers, they can easily have a million subscribers on Line. That&apos;s the minimum, actually!&quot; As for the advice, Line is keen for its celebrity users to understand that the app is about more than text-based marketing \u2013\u00a0something that Facebook and Twitter have also moved towards in their advice for social marketing. &quot;Our proposal to celebrities, especially musicians, is that we are operating in a smartphone and 3G or 4G environment, so you should try to push more interactive and video content, not just a text,&quot; says Kim. &quot;In Asia, we&apos;re releasing new packages with top singers: a sticker plus MP3 files. It&apos;s a new format: people can listen to the music on Line, but the exciting part is when they sing the song, they can send a sticker to their friends.&quot; Music will play a bigger role in Line&apos;s future: the company recently announced plans to launch a service called Line Music, enabling people to listen to songs with their friends. It&apos;s due to launch this year \u2013 in Japan at least \u2013\u00a0but for now Kim has no more details to share. She&apos;s focusing on the global rollout for Line as a whole, including the UK. &quot;We are anxious to get into this market, so we will prepare for the service this year or early next year,&quot; says Kim. &quot;We don&apos;t want to introduce Line as a new messaging app, though. It&apos;s a new social service for the young generation.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/23/htc-shuts-one-of-four-smartphone-production-lines-sources-say", "publicationDate": "2013-10-23T21:31:01Z", "tags": ["HTC", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Technology", "Samsung", "Apple"], "sentences": ["Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC has halted at least one of its four main manufacturing lines, accounting for at least a fifth of total capacity, and is outsourcing production as a sales slump puts pressure on its cash flow, according to sources with direct knowledge of the situation.", "The company, whose woes have been exacerbated by supply chain constraints and internal turmoil, reported its first quarterly loss in more than a decade this month, of 3.5bn Taiwanese dollars (\u00a373m) and its cash flow from operations dropped to a negative \u00a3440m as of the end of June, indicating that it was spending more than it was receiving.", "HTC initially denied it was shutting down any production, in Taiwan or elsewhere, and declined to comment on whether it was in discussions to outsource production.", "Update: in a filing to the Taiwanese stock exchange on Wednesday, the company said: &quot;HTC is not shutting down nor does it have plans to sell any of its factory\u00a0assets.", "HTC was considering selling the out-of-use production lines in China and Taiwan, two of the sources said.", "HTC, which positions itself as a premium brand, will contract out some manufacturing to FIH Mobile Ltd International , a subsidiary of Taiwan&apos;s Hon Hai Precision Industry, because contract manufacturers have better component supply management and cost control."], "title": "HTC shuts one of four smartphone production lines, sources say", "article": "Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC has halted at least one of its four main manufacturing lines, accounting for at least a fifth of total capacity, and is outsourcing production as a sales slump puts pressure on its cash flow, according to sources with direct knowledge of the situation. A Reuters reporter who visited an HTC factory at the company&apos;s former headquarters in Taoyuan, about an hour&apos;s drive from Taipei, saw loading docks shuttered and a sign on a locked lobby door that read: &quot;Lobby is temporarily closed for use. Thank you for your cooperation.&quot; HTC launched its latest version of the flagship One series handsets this year but has struggled to gain traction in a market dominated by larger rivals Apple and Samsung Electronics. The company, whose woes have been exacerbated by supply chain constraints and internal turmoil, reported its first quarterly loss in more than a decade this month, of 3.5bn Taiwanese dollars (\u00a373m) and its cash flow from operations dropped to a negative \u00a3440m as of the end of June, indicating that it was spending more than it was receiving. Despite lacklustre sales, HTC devices usually receive rave reviews, and it has in recent months expanded its range to include smaller and larger models of the One phone and hinted at further products, including a tablet and a wearable device. HTC initially denied it was shutting down any production, in Taiwan or elsewhere, and declined to comment on whether it was in discussions to outsource production. Update: in a filing to the Taiwanese stock exchange on Wednesday, the company said: &quot;HTC is not shutting down nor does it have plans to sell any of its factory\u00a0assets. HTC has a strong cash position and financial structure, and will\u00a0provide the latest financials in our upcoming earnings call to investors\u00a0and the broader community.&quot; That call will be on 5 November. The statement does not however contradict the sources&apos; suggestion that production at one of the lines has been halted. &apos;Strong balance sheet&apos; &quot;HTC is not shutting down nor has plans to sell any of its factory assets,&quot; the company said in an emailed response to queries from Reuters. &quot;HTC has a very strong balance sheet and will provide the latest financials in our upcoming earnings call to investors and the broader community.&quot; When asked about what Reuters had seen at the factory in a telephone interview, HTC chief marketing officer Ben Ho declined to give details, but said: &quot;Like any manufacturer, we do volume planning to optimize our lines, our manufacturing and production facilities. &quot;Whether we are operating those facilities depends on market demand and our own expectations. When you have less demand you work with less facilities to optimize your costs. When you have demand, or bigger growth, you definitely have to activate all these facilities.&quot; According to data from HTC and the research company IDC, HTC&apos;s quarterly phone shipments have dropped from a peak of 13.3m units in the third quarter of 2011 to around 6m units in the same period this year. Two of the four sources who spoke to Reuters said HTC had combined production from two lines at Taoyuan into one, which would reduce its potential capacity by about 1m phones per month, out of a total capacity of around 2.5m at the site and around 4.5m including operations elsewhere. Manufacturing has been halted since at least August on the line, housed in a facility called Building H, while production continued at a nearby plant known as TY5. Most of the assembly lines in HTC&apos;s Shanghai factory, which can produce 2m phones a month, were also out of production, one of the sources said, with only a small number of phones being produced for sale inside China. HTC was considering selling the out-of-use production lines in China and Taiwan, two of the sources said. &quot;HTC&apos;s cash flow is not doing well. It has to do something soon to generate cash,&quot; said one of the sources with direct knowledge of the manufacturing sale plan. Temporary handover HTC&apos; chief executive Peter Chou, the driving force behind its award-winning handsets, has temporarily handed some of his duties to the company&apos;s chairwoman in order to focus on innovation and product development, the Financial Times reported on Monday. Shares of HTC jumped following the report, on hopes that the change of duties among the top management will help it recapture the sparkle that saw it named Device Manufacturer of the Year at the World Mobile Congress in 2011, when its stock was flying high. The company&apos;s market value has roughly halved this year. HTC, which positions itself as a premium brand, will contract out some manufacturing to FIH Mobile Ltd International , a subsidiary of Taiwan&apos;s Hon Hai Precision Industry, because contract manufacturers have better component supply management and cost control. It is also in talks with Compal Communications and Wistron Corp, according to four sources. FIH and Hon Hai declined to comment. Spokesmen for Compal Communications and Wistron could not be reached for comment. HTC also declined to comment. One of the sources said HTC&apos;s top management had agreed to separate the design and manufacturing businesses, which would more closely resemble Apple&apos;s model of creating products in-house but then outsourcing to assemblers such as Hon Hai. By contrast Samsung Electronics both designs and manufacturers its smartphones. However, sources said even if HTC splits the two operations, it would likely hold onto some of its factory capacity initially as the split-up would be a slow process and HTC might explore the possibility of making phones for others. Chou aims for a doubling In a Town Hall meeting with staff on Tuesday, CEO Chou said HTC aimed to double its shares of the high-end smartphone market to 15% next year. When asked about separating out the manufacturing business, he said the company did not rule out the possibility. The comments were reported by local media and confirmed by Ho. At the end of June, HTC&apos;s cash position decreased to NT$48.1bn (\u00a31.02bn) from NT$55.5bn (\u00a31.18bn) a year earlier as cash flow turned negative. Its balance sheet also shows that bill payments increased while less money came in from customers. Receivables - the money owed to the business - increased by NT$7.9bn (\u00a3167m), but accounts payable - the money by the business to its suppliers - dropped NT$7.8bn (\u00a3165m). HTC&apos;s return on assets (ROA) - an indicator of how effectively a company uses its assets to generate earnings - is expected to turn negative this year at -0.69%, the first time since 1999, according to SmartEstimates. Its ROA last year was 8.1%. No potential bidders for the manufacturing space have surfaced so far, in part because the global smartphone and tablet PC supply chain is facing overcapacity, the sources said. As a result, HTC is also exploring other options to generate income by using its factories, sources said. Several analyst and media reports said HTC was in talks with Chinese peer Lenovo Group Ltd and US online retailer Amazon. There is also speculation that Hon Hai will use HTC&apos;s plant for its own production. Hon Hai said there was no plan to use HTC&apos;s production lines in Taoyuan now. Lenovo declined to comment and Amazon could not be reached for comment."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/24/samsung-fined-taiwan-campaign-against-smartphone-htc", "publicationDate": "2013-10-24T16:18:57Z", "tags": ["Samsung", "HTC", "Taiwan", "Technology", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s Fair Trade Commission on Thursday fined the local unit of South Korea&apos;s\u00a0SamsungElectronics NT$10m (\u00a3212,000/$340,000) for organising an &quot;astroturfing&quot; campaign to denigrate smartphone rival HTC.", "The incidents first surfaced in April, when the Taiwan FTC said that it would investigate the matter after receiving complaints.", "The United Evening News in Taiwan said at the time that students had been hired through Samsung&apos;s local agent to write online articles attacking HTC and recommending Samsung phones.", "At the time Samsung posted on its Facebook page that it regretted &quot;any inconvenience and confusion from the Internet event&quot; and that &quot;Samsung Taiwan has halted all Internet marketing such as posting articles on website.&quot; The fine imposed was less than half the maximum NT$25m that could have been levied.", "The FTC also handed out smaller fines on two Taiwanese trading companies it said were responsible for mounting the online campaign."], "title": "Samsung fined in Taiwan for 'dirty tricks' campaign against smartphone rival HTC", "article": "Taiwan&apos;s Fair Trade Commission on Thursday fined the local unit of South Korea&apos;s\u00a0SamsungElectronics NT$10m (\u00a3212,000/$340,000) for organising an &quot;astroturfing&quot; campaign to denigrate smartphone rival HTC.

Now its scotch sells for \u00a31,500 a bottle", "article": "Port Ellen on the island of Islay, just off Scotland&apos;s west coast, would seem an unlikely twin for a village in Burgundy or the Loire. The latter are likely to have considerable wealth based on their ancient vineyards, while the former is a rugged \u2013 albeit beautiful \u2013 fishing village with a couple of pubs, a few shops and an Indian restaurant. However, a common trait now links these places: both lend their names to extraordinarily expensive drinks. Wines from Gevrey-Chambertin or Pouilly-sur-Loire can sell for eye-watering prices; now Port Ellen is to join this elite club of beverage makers. The drinks conglomerate Diageo will this week release 2,950 bottles of Port Ellen whisky \u2013 at \u00a31,500 a bottle. Within days, many will be offered on eBay at twice that price \u2013 not bad for a whisky that sold for \u00a330 two decades ago. &quot;Port Ellen&apos;s price has soared for a straightforward reason,&quot; says Diageo&apos;s Nick Morgan. &quot;We don&apos;t make it any more. Its scarcity is the driver.&quot; And that is the extraordinary aspect of the Port Ellen story. Its distillery was closed in 1983 because demand for whisky was plummeting. Today the industry is struggling to meet demand. New distilleries are being built, warehouses expanded and imports of barley \u2013 whisky&apos;s prime ingredient \u2013 have soared. Scottish whisky&apos;s fortunes have been transformed, with considerable political ramifications. The story of Port Ellen, therefore, has key implications. In the late 1950s, regulations controlling whisky manufacture were changed and distilleries made big improvements in output, creating a glut in a market then dominated by the US and Britain. Sales peaked and companies cut production. Distilleries \u2013 including Port Ellen \u2013 were closed and their great gleaming copper stills sold for scrap. The Port Ellen decision has since been scrutinised, because its whisky was one of Islay&apos;s most distinctive single malts with a deep smoky taste derived from the peat used to dry its barley. &quot;Port Ellen was then used entirely to make blended whisky and it was thought that our other distilleries \u2013 at Lagavulin and Caol Ila \u2013 would simply take up the slack,&quot; adds Morgan. Since then there has been an extraordinary transformation in the fortunes of whisky makers. &quot;It has become the drink of aspiration for the spreading middle classes of China, Latin America, Taiwan and other nations,&quot; said Campbell Evans of the Scottish Whisky Association. A bottle of Johnnie Walker, the world&apos;s biggest selling whisky, or another similar blend on a sideboard has become a symbol of success in many homes around the world. &quot;The point is that Scottish whisky is made to very rigorous manufacturing standards. When you buy a bottle, you know it will be good and it will be just as good as the last bottle you bought,&quot; adds Evans. The fact that whisky is becoming the number one choice of the planet&apos;s swelling middle classes is good news for Scotland, of course. Over the past decade, whisky exports have almost doubled, creating a market that was worth \u00a34.3bn to the Treasury last year. On top of that, the Treasury made \u00a3800m from duty on whisky sales inside Britain. &quot;Today whisky accounts for 25% of the UK&apos;s entire food and drink overseas market,&quot; says Evans. And that has crucial implications for control of the industry and its staggering dividends, which could switch dramatically depending on the outcome of Scotland&apos;s independence vote next year. Manufacturers and distillers refuse to comment on any issues they might have about an independent Scotland&apos;s treatment of their industry, though Evans was at pains to stress the importance that the EU \u2013 whose future relations with an independent Scotland remain unresolved \u2013 plays in negotiating protective tariffs for Scottish whisky around the world. &quot;To put it simply, we need EU protection,&quot; he said. By contrast, concerns over next week&apos;s Port Ellen sale are of a slightly lower order. Collectors merely have to work out if a bottle is really worth \u00a31,500, while Diageo has to contemplate how to price next year&apos;s release. &quot;We are down to our last few casks,&quot; says Morgan. &quot;In a decade or so, it might all be gone. Future pricing is going to be very tricky.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/27/new-to-nature-hydrophylita-emporos", "publicationDate": "2013-10-26T23:04:02Z", "tags": ["Zoology", "Animals", "Wildlife", "Science", "World news", "Environment"], "sentences": ["Yuan Tung Shih, with co-authors including Dr Andrew Polaszek of the Natural History Museum in London, have described a new species, H emporos, from Taiwan that packs a lot of amazing behaviour into its diminutive size."], "title": "New to nature No 114: Hydrophylita emporos", "article": "About 800 species of parasitic wasps of the family Trichogrammatidae have been named to date but, as with most species-rich groups of small-sized insects, there are no doubt many yet to come. If you are not an entomologist and the name sounds familiar it may be because species of the genus Trichogramma are among agriculture&apos;s success stories in searching for biological control agents for crop pests. Of the more than 80 genera in the family, three include parasites of eggs of various aquatic insects. Only four species of the genus Hydrophylita have been described, all from the new world and all, as far as is known, parasites of damselfly eggs. New and yet-to-be-named species have been reported from Madagascar, Indonesia and Australia, suggesting that the genus will ultimately contain far more species. Yuan Tung Shih, with co-authors including Dr Andrew Polaszek of the Natural History Museum in London, have described a new species, H emporos, from Taiwan that packs a lot of amazing behaviour into its diminutive size. One expects parasites of eggs to be small, of course, and this species does not disappoint, measuring in at a mere 1.1 to 1.2mm. But it is a comparative giant among others in the family, some of which include the smallest fully winged insects, measuring a scant 0.17mm. For every male in the new species, 125 females were observed, and it is suspected that males may spend most of their lives under water. Amazingly for a wasp, they need to surface no more than once per day. Enlarged claws of females may help them cling to the substrate and avoid being swept away in currents. H emporos is parasitic on the damselfly Psolodesmus mandarinus mandarinus in northern Thailand. The female host uses the tip of her abdomen to make an incision in a leaf for her eggs. She prefers submerged branches of Piper kadsura, an east Asian species of pepper vine commonly known as &quot;Japanese pepper&quot;. One and sometimes several of the wasps may be found lurking at the base of the abdomen of the host. When the damselfly begins probing a plant in search of a good site for her eggs, the wasps make their move, walking quickly to the tip of her abdomen. Using wings and legs to swim and walk, the tiny wasps leave their unaware transport to reach the damselfly&apos;s eggs and begin to lay their own. Phoretic behaviour is unique to this species in the genus, but hitching a ride is not unknown in the family and appears in this case to not only position them near host eggs but also to plunge them into the aquatic domain. They are so small that they have great difficulty breaking surface tension on their own. While most females of the next generation emerge to take flight and seek out a new damselfly, some apparently remain underwater attacking remaining eggs that avoiding the first round of attack. It is interesting that where phoretic behaviour is seen in half a dozen families of wasps and flies, in all cases, including the present one, the hosts are insects that lay large masses of eggs. The online article describing this remarkable little wasp is open access in the journal PLoS One and includes a short movie of their behaviour."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/29/film-today", "publicationDate": "2013-10-29T07:30:01Z", "tags": ["Film", "Chris Hemsworth"], "sentences": ["On the site today \u2022 Thor star Chris Hemsworth reluctant to take shirt off for scene in sequel \u2022 Disney to discontinue Star Wars and Marvel slot machines \u2022 Luc Besson/Scarlett Johansson drug mule movie quits Taiwan over aggressive paparazzi\u00a0 \u2022 Susan Boyle confirms biopic \u2022 Fifty Shades: filming delayed by a month \u2022 This week&apos;s quiz is on the evergreen horror franchise, Nightmare on Elm Street \u2022 Video interview with Paulina Garc\u00eda, the star of Gloria, the latest film from the suddenly-hot Chilean industry, about a fiftysomething woman looking for love in the bars and clubs You may have missed           \u2022 Jeremy Kay on the US box office over the weekend, including The Counselor&apos;s flop and Jackass&apos;s triumph \u2022 Our top 10 series tackles war movies \u2022 Diane Keaton plans US remake of BBC&apos;s Last Tango in Halifax \u2022 Meryl Streep, Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz tipped for &quot;female Expendables&quot; \u2022 Sean Connery is America&apos;s favourite British film star \u2022 Ben Affleck was &quot;reluctant&quot; to take Batman role and is planning to direct untitled geopolitical thriller \u2022 Edith Head&apos;s costume designs were Google-ised \u2022 Stuart Heritage&apos;s liveblog of Hammer&apos;s Blood from the Mummy&apos;s Tomb"], "title": "Film today: Chris Hemsworth is feeling a little Thor", "article": "On the site today \u2022 Thor star Chris Hemsworth reluctant to take shirt off for scene in sequel \u2022 Disney to discontinue Star Wars and Marvel slot machines \u2022 Luc Besson/Scarlett Johansson drug mule movie quits Taiwan over aggressive paparazzi\u00a0 \u2022 Susan Boyle confirms biopic \u2022 Fifty Shades: filming delayed by a month \u2022 This week&apos;s quiz is on the evergreen horror franchise, Nightmare on Elm Street \u2022 Video interview with Paulina Garc\u00eda, the star of Gloria, the latest film from the suddenly-hot Chilean industry, about a fiftysomething woman looking for love in the bars and clubs You may have missed           \u2022 Jeremy Kay on the US box office over the weekend, including The Counselor&apos;s flop and Jackass&apos;s triumph \u2022 Our top 10 series tackles war movies \u2022 Diane Keaton plans US remake of BBC&apos;s Last Tango in Halifax \u2022 Meryl Streep, Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz tipped for &quot;female Expendables&quot; \u2022 Sean Connery is America&apos;s favourite British film star \u2022 Ben Affleck was &quot;reluctant&quot; to take Batman role and is planning to direct untitled geopolitical thriller \u2022 Edith Head&apos;s costume designs were Google-ised \u2022 Stuart Heritage&apos;s liveblog of Hammer&apos;s Blood from the Mummy&apos;s Tomb"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2013/oct/29/international-school-students-cultural-identity", "publicationDate": "2013-10-29T10:49:20Z", "tags": ["Students", "Higher education", "Education", "International students"], "sentences": ["Press me, and I&apos;ll say that I&apos;m also half Taiwanese.", "For me, I&apos;ll never be Taiwanese, no matter what I do.", "My passport might as well have been Taiwanese.", "I count with my fingers the way they do in Taiwan and I grew up eating roti in Singaporean food courts and goose fat noodles at my grandmother&apos;s house in Kaohsiung."], "title": "International school students: rootless and without a home?", "article": "Remy Shea is a sixth-form student at my international school in Beijing. When I ask her where she is from, she says: &quot;I&apos;m Canadian-Chinese but, at the same time, I&apos;m neither.&quot; Most students at my school aren&apos;t from one particular place. Sure, our passports might say we&apos;re British or Malaysian, but it&apos;s more complicated than that. Where you&apos;re &quot;from&quot; is less about birthplace and more about cultural identity; as an expat student your cultural identity ends up being difficult to categorise. If you ask me where I&apos;m from, I&apos;ll tell you I&apos;m English. Press me, and I&apos;ll say that I&apos;m also half Taiwanese. Ask which part of England I&apos;m from, and I&apos;ll be forced to explain that I spent most of my childhood and part of my adolescence flitting around Asia: Taipei, Shanghai, Singapore, Beijing. Though I was born in Guisborough in Yorkshire, I honestly couldn&apos;t point it out on a map or tell you anything about the place. Students like me are uniquely rootless; we don&apos;t belong anywhere and we can&apos;t describe ourselves as any one thing. Some find that they make their home wherever their family is. Some just accept the inherent loneliness that comes with the lack of concrete ties to any single place. Exir Kamalabadi, a year 13 student at my school, sums it up perfectly: &quot;I&apos;ll never be Chinese, no matter what I do.&quot; Replace &quot;Chinese&quot; with any other country, and you can understand the conflict within many &quot;third culture kids&quot;, as we&apos;ve been dubbed by the media. For me, I&apos;ll never be Taiwanese, no matter what I do. And, despite my predominantly English-influenced upbringing, I will never feel fully at home there either. I feel like a foreigner everywhere I go, a sentiment echoed by other students at international schools like mine. Mixed-race students who travel a lot while growing up can lack a cultural identity and also have to struggle with the fact that they don&apos;t have a history \u2013 or not one that&apos;s easily explained. Kamalabadi says: &quot;I very much feel like a cyber-age person, with bits and pieces of my background stuck together like a montage from the things I read, movies I watch and places I&apos;ve been.&quot; For me, a cultural identity is something I have to cultivate and maintain, not something that falls into place naturally. I&apos;ve heard my accent becoming progressively more American over the last five years. This is jarring because my vaguely British accent was the last real reminder of where I was born. Without it, how am I supposed to tell people I&apos;m from the UK? I&apos;ve had to make a concerted effort to retain my nondescript, regionally ambiguous &quot;English&quot; accent because without it, I don&apos;t have any proof that I was from the UK at all. My passport might as well have been Taiwanese. This lack of definition means that I&apos;ve ended up in a murky haze of different cultures, with bits and pieces from everywhere I&apos;ve lived and everyone I&apos;ve met. I count with my fingers the way they do in Taiwan and I grew up eating roti in Singaporean food courts and goose fat noodles at my grandmother&apos;s house in Kaohsiung. My accent is tinged with my friends&apos; American inflections, but I still spell colour with a &apos;u&apos; and lament the lack of Gregg&apos;s in China.

It&apos;s the biggest movie production to hit Taiwan since Ang Lee&apos;s Oscar-winning fantasy blockbuster Life of Pi in 2011, and local reports suggest the pair have had enough of photographers swarming around cast and crew.

The American actor is said to have been &quot;spooked&quot; by actions of aggressive paparazzi. Taipei mayor Hau Lung-bin has issued a statement berating the &quot;dangerous action&quot; of local photographers and calling for restraint. The Taipei Film Commission yesterday also denied reports that Lucy was to quit Taiwan, but admitted Besson had been upset by paparazzi activities. &quot;The shoot is going very well.

Artistic director and chief executive Alistair Spalding announced a 10-year plan that has at its core the creation of a new 500-seat venue designed to present &quot;mid-scale&quot; work. He said the appetite for dance from young and old had never been greater. &quot;It seems to me that something is happening out there that we really want to take advantage of \u2013 to make it the artform for now, because it really does seem to be that.&quot; It is also an opportunity for London to take over from the traditionally recognised dance centres of New York and Paris, neither of which is producing the levels of new work of London, he said. The search is now on for a venue, a conversion or new build, with a view to opening in 2018. &quot;We&apos;re hoping people will come to us and say &apos;we have the perfect space for you&apos;,&quot; said Spalding. One motivation, he said, had been having to turn away great work unsuitable for the 1,500-seat main auditorium, the 180-seat Lilian Baylis studio or the 1,000-seat Peacock theatre used to stage more West End-style shows. With audiences running at 88%, the centre needs more space to satisfy appetites. Spalding said it was too early to specify what the new venue would cost but he rejected a suggestion it might be near \u00a3100m. It would not be luxurious and could be achieved relatively cheaply, he said. It would be &quot;a very contemporary space&quot; young audiences would enjoy. Spalding also said the organisation planned to invest \u00a35m over the next decade in original dance work \u2013 part of a strategy to allow the art form to punch above its perceived weight. &quot;Dance has just not been seen in the same light as theatre and opera. It has not been really deeply embedded in our culture, unlike theatre. We&apos;ve got to try and push ourselves in to a different place and there is an appetite.&quot; The announcements were made as Sadler&apos;s Wells revealed details of one of its most successful years with audience figures of nearly 500,000 in 2012-13. For every \u00a31 of public subsidy it got, \u00a310 was generated. Spalding said the 2014 programme would be its busiest spring/summer season to date with 40 shows being performed across its current three venues. The superstar company Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch will visit in February with a rarely performed piece called 1980 that Bausch \u2013 who died in 2009 \u2013 wrote after the death of her partner Ralf Borzik. Other highlights will include the return of what was the first contemporary dance company to set up in any Chinese speaking country, the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre of Taiwan; and a celebration of the World Cup in Brazil when 35 performers show off their samba skills in Brasil Brasileiro. Spalding also announced that the Canadian choreographer Crystal Pite would be Sadler&apos;s Wells&apos; 16th associate artist and her latest work, The Tempest Replica, would get its UK premiere in April."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/toronto-mayor-rob-ford-controversy", "publicationDate": "2013-11-06T17:43:30Z", "tags": ["Canada", "World news"], "sentences": ["I went to Seoul, South Korea, I went to Taipei, Taiwan."], "title": "Toronto mayor Rob Ford: smoking crack is not the only resignation issue", "article": "\u201cYes, I have smoked crack cocaine,\u201d Toronto mayor Rob Ford said on Tuesday. \u201cProbably in one of my drunken stupors.\u201d\u00a0 The admission followed six months of did-he-or-didn&apos;t-he speculation, and the\u00a0calls for him to step down grew louder, but Ford\u00a0said he intends to remain mayor of\u00a0Canada\u2019s largest city. Ford was elected as Toronto&apos;s 64th mayor in 2010, and was ordered out of office two years later by a judge who found him guilty of a conflict of interest over his\u00a0private football foundation.\u00a0That decision was later overturned, but it served as a highlight in a public life that has seen Ford admit to reading newspapers while driving, and have to be asked to leave a party because organizers were concerned about him being drunk. (The reading-while-driving event was memorialized in a butter sculpture.) Many who have\u00a0followed Ford\u2019s controversial career were calling for him to resign long before the crack cocaine admission. Here&apos;s why. Assault allegations In 2008, Ford\u2019s wife, Renata, charged him with assault and making a threat against her. The charges were withdrawn 10 minutes after the case was heard because of inconsistencies and \u201ccredibility issues\u201d with Renata Ford\u2019s allegations. Ford said: &quot;Justice has been served today.&quot; His former rival Sarah Thomson accused Ford of sexual assault when they were running for mayor in 2010. Ford responded by saying the allegations were &quot;not true&quot;, and questioned whether Thomson was \u201cplaying with a full deck.\u201d Thomson said she thought Ford was high on cocaine at the time. No charges were brought. In 2012, Ford was involved in an incident with Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale while Dale was researching a story about the public land behind Ford\u2019s house. The pair agreed that Ford did not throw any punches, but Ford admitted he may have charged the reporter\u00a0and blocked Dale like \u201ca cornered rat\u201d.     Toronto protesters outside city hall. Photograph: Aaron Harris/Reuters    Racism? In March 2008, when Ford was a city councillor, he said:  \u201cThose oriental people work like dogs. They work their hearts out. They are workers non-stop. They sleep beside their machines. That\u2019s why they\u2019re successful in life. I went to Seoul, South Korea, I went to Taipei, Taiwan. I went to Tokyo, Japan. That\u2019s why these people are so hard workers (sic). I\u2019m telling you, the oriental people, they\u2019re slowly taking over.\u201d  Homophobia? While running for mayor in 2010, Ford and pastor Wendell Brereton, who was running for city council, mutually endorsed each other. Brereton was known for making anti-gay comments and once said that same-sex marriage can \u201cdismantle\u201d democratic\u00a0civilisation. Ford said he also supports \u201ctraditional marriage.\u201d A National Post transcript showed that in a June 2006 debate on HIV/Aids spending, Ford said: \u201cWhy are we catering to one group with a disease that&apos;s preventable? It&apos;s very preventable. If you&apos;re not doing needles and you&apos;re not gay, you won&apos;t get Aids probably. And I don&apos;t know why we&apos;re spending $1.5m on this.\u201d\u00a0 Football Ford coaches two junior football teams, and was nearly removed from office when he was found to have accepted improper donations on behalf of his private football foundation. The Toronto Star found that Ford\u2019s aides\u2019 used \u201ca significant portion of their workday\u201d to help the teams. He also has missed city council meetings and left executive meetings early to uphold his duties coaching the Don Bosco Eagles high school football team. Toronto transit passengers were told in November 2012 to get off a bus so it could be re-routed to pick up a football team playing an away game. It was raining. Drink and drugs Ford initially denied even being present at an April 2006 Toronto Maple Leafs game at which he drunkenly harassed a couple. After the couple asked him to be quiet, he said: &quot;Do you want your little wife to go over to Iran and get raped and shot?&quot; He was subsequently removed from the game, and only later admitted to having been there.  In 1999, in Florida, Ford\u00a0was charged with driving under the influence\u00a0and possession of marijuana.\u00a0The drug charge was dropped, and he pleaded no contest to impaired driving. When the incident became public in 2010, much like the crack smoking, Ford denied everything: &quot;I\u2019m dead serious. When I say no, I mean never. No question. Now I\u2019m getting offended. No means no.&quot; He later blamed his faulty memory.\u00a0"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/nov/07/nexus-samsung-android-patents", "publicationDate": "2013-11-07T07:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "sentences": ["[corrected] Shipments of Nexus 7, Kindle Fire HDX below expectations &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Monthly shipments of the new Google Nexus 7 and those of the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX have fallen short of original expectations and therefore their shipments in 2013 are likely to be lower than their preceding models in 2012, according to Taiwan-based supply chain makers.", "Usual pinch of salt, though Digitimes&apos;s Taiwanese supply chain sources are usually solid; the Nexus 7 is made by Asus in Taiwan."], "title": "Boot up: Android patent payments, Samsung promises, tablet woes, and more", "article": "A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Yes, parts of KitKat are exclusive to the Nexus 5.

Those parts are the integration of Google Now into the home screen and the ability to activate Voice Search by saying &quot;Okay, Google&quot; while on the home screen. The latter part isn&apos;t entirely surprising, as that functionality always seemed to be presented as more of a Nexus 5 feature than a core KitKat element (and it may require some level of hardware-specific integration in order to work efficiently). Keeping the new presentation of Google Now exclusive to one device is rather unexpected, though, since that&apos;s a strictly UI-oriented software element. But for better or for worse, that part of KitKat will not appear on other Nexus devices - or any other Android phones - for the time being.  So an updated Nexus 4 will still have Google Now as a separate app. Even the Nexus line is fragmented?  As it happened: Samsung&apos;s analyst day liveblog &gt;&gt; WSJ Digits blog  Mr. Yoon paints an apocalyptic vision of the future - one with no appliances like washing machines, televisions, air conditioners.

In short, the company wants to build a universe of products that effectively give customers no reason to buy any competitors&apos; products, since all the Samsung products will, in theory, mesh seamlessly together.\u00a0 It may not be brand new, but an interesting concept all the same. Ominous word choice with the phrase &quot;lock-in,&quot; though.

Apple pre-announcing software? This is a first, surely. How BlackBerry and Watsa can win with John Chen &gt;&gt; Businessweek  The BlackBerry smartphone itself can and should be made by someone else, or die a dignified death. Sure, some people love the QWERTY keyboard, some might even like the tiny screen. But in a business that requires scale, it&apos;s not a place where BlackBerry can profitably compete. The challenge right now is time, which is running out for a company that&apos;s burning through cash. Watsa&apos;s $4.7bn offer, had it succeeded, would have increased that pressure by piling on a crushing level of debt. Instead, Chen has to move quickly to cut costs but keep relevant top talent. It doesn&apos;t help that Google recently chose BlackBerry&apos;s hometown of Waterloo, Ont., to be its sole Canadian tech hub. He has to find a way to hand off the smartphone business without killing its customer base \u2014 a task that could take a year or two. And he has to shift management&apos;s mindset to competing with other software providers, rather than Samsung or Apple.  Apple adds suppliers to boost smartphone, tablet production &gt;&gt; WSJ.com  According to J.P. Morgan analyst Alvin Kwock, the high return rate of defective iPhone 5 smartphones also led to tensions between Apple and Hon Hai over which company would be responsible for repair-work costs. Apple declined to comment on the manufacturing and labor issues. &quot;Hon Hai Chairman Terry Gou is not willing to cut contract prices substantially to get more orders from Apple. Hon Hai is also aware of the risk of building gigantic production capacity for a single customer so it is adopting a more cautious stance on expanding production,&quot; said a Hon Hai executive, who declined to be named. Hon Hai&apos;s fortunes have largely hinged on Apple because about 40% of its revenue comes from the Cupertino-based company. Its operating margins have been under pressure over the past year due to high labor costs and a slowdown in revenue growth. &quot;Apple has raised this quarter&apos;s iPhone 5S orders from Hon Hai as demand has been stronger than expected. But it takes time to boost production capacity and Apple can&apos;t find other assemblers to increase production to meet demand immediately,&quot; said the Hon Hai executive.  Wistron to make the iPhone 5C, Compal to make the iPad mini. But how high is the &quot;high&quot; return rate for  the 5S  last year&apos;s iPhone 5? [corrected] Shipments of Nexus 7, Kindle Fire HDX below expectations &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Monthly shipments of the new Google Nexus 7 and those of the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX have fallen short of original expectations and therefore their shipments in 2013 are likely to be lower than their preceding models in 2012, according to Taiwan-based supply chain makers. The sources said that as of now monthly shipments of the two devices are down from what they were in 2012 and are likely to continue that way until the end of the year, adding the decline is likely because of increased competition in the market. The sources also believe that due to recent upgrades for Apple&apos;s iPad and iPad mini series, the Google and Amazon products will have a weaker foothold in the market during 2013.  Usual pinch of salt, though Digitimes&apos;s Taiwanese supply chain sources are usually solid; the Nexus 7 is made by Asus in Taiwan. It seems counterintuitive though that midrange tablets would be challenged by the low end *and* high end.

This is the mecca of particle physics. Most of it looks like a fairly undistinguished campus. &quot;The money has not been spent on the buildings,&quot; I am repeatedly told. &quot;The money is all underground.&quot; Underground, of course, are the tunnels where beams of light are smashed into each other. Under my feet are the colliders and detectors that are helping us understand what the universe is actually made of. Above ground it&apos;s all fairly utilitarian. After dumping my bag in the spartan hotel, I head over to the big canteen. The streets are named things like Route Heisenberg or Route Democrite (Democritus postulated the first atom). Cern has four restaurants, but the big canteen is the centre of the place. Cern, indeed physics itself, has entered popular consciousness in recent years. Geeks are pretty cool, and theoretical physics has replaced philosophy as a signifier of intellectual prowess. My\u00a012-year-old had heard of the Large Hadron Collider. &quot;That&apos;s where Sheldon wants to go.&quot; Indeed, a whole episode of The Big Bang Theory was about Leonard wanting to take his girlfriend to Switzerland to see the LHC, which resulted in Sheldon&apos;s paroxysms of jealousy. &quot;But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research! I&apos;ve been dreaming of seeing the Large Hadron Collider since I\u00a0was nine.&quot; I am no Sheldon, but have been wondering about Cern since seeing hordes of people cheering when the announcements about the Higgs boson (many people here call it the Goddam particle) were made and a recalcitrant Peter Higgs getting the Noble prize. &quot;Oh yeah, sleeping bags everywhere, queues to get in,&quot; a young Canadian tells me. What do all these people do all day, I\u00a0wondered, these people preoccupied by that which we cannot see? As I sit down in the canteen \u2013 every expense spared, except for an Antony Gormley sculptural scribble hanging outside \u2013 it is obvious these people have their minds on something higher than decor. &quot;Will I see anyone doing any physics?&quot; I muse to myself without having any real idea what that might look like. Next to me two guys are\u00a0talking Japanese but I can hear the words &quot;configurations&quot;, &quot;servers&quot;, &quot;axes&quot;, &quot;rubics&quot;. Just opposite, some young guys and an older man are actually working stuff out on the back of a napkin. This, I will soon realise, is how it\u00a0is. Indeed, one of them tells me, &quot;one of the top guys here works everything out on the back of an envelope. So he keeps a special supply of envelopes.&quot;     'The money has not been spent on the buildings \u2013 the money is all underground' \u2026 offices at Cern. Photograph: Stefan Pangritz    These people live and breathe physics. A young woman shows me the iPad she has just been &quot;doodling&quot; on. It&apos;s all numbers and equations. Carl Sagan may have said that &quot;we are all made of stars&quot;, but here this translates as &quot;we are all made of numbers&quot;, and if you are not a numbers person, Cern is another planet. Often when I am talking to people, they will jump up and draw a quick graph to make their point, which only further confuses me. It takes a while to get used to the international babble all around \u2013 &quot;Cernish&quot; is the common language \u2013 and\u00a0the way people will introduce themselves: &quot;I&apos;m accelerators.&quot; Cern, founded in 1954, has 20 member states, with many other countries co-operating. The atmosphere is collegiate but blokey. The ratio of men\u00a0to women is about 80:20, but the women I meet are well supported. There\u00a0is a creche and a kindergarten, and I see toddlers running round. The problem seems to be getting women into apprenticeships, and the UK as a whole suffers from our shortage of engineers. Once in, though, there appears to be less of an old boys&apos; network than in many professions. &quot;As long as you drink coffee, you are in.&quot; Most people here \u2013 apart from the British \u2013 have four or five languages. Cern employs 2,000 people, but another 10,000 pass through, working on the\u00a0four main experiments (AMS, CMS,\u00a0Atlas and LHC). This is a large and shifting community. People may come on student placements and then get work here. In summer the place is full of students drinking beer outside. To live here requires commitment \u2013 the surrounding villages either in France or Switzerland are expensive. But it soon becomes clear that people are here for the work, and the line between work and leisure is permeable. They often work 16 hours a day, because they want to. Even in the canteen. &quot;There is an etiquette. If they have their laptops open, it could be an ideas meeting,&quot; Claire Lee (physicist and Phd\u00a0student) tells me. &quot;Oh, they keep all hours,&quot; says Rachel Bray (product lifecycle management and document management specialist). &quot;My office is next door to some theoretical physicists. I\u00a0often see them rock up at 5.30. Or having a kip. There are no rigid hours.&quot;     The children's play area in the cafeteria at Cern. Photograph: Stefan Pangritz for the Guardian    Rachel tells me about all the clubs that Cern employees can go to. Many are keen to shake off the image of physicists as wild\u2013haired, eccentric old men, and that image is easily disrupted when I see a hip young woman and a guy queueing for his dinner in the bottom half of a gorilla suit. &quot;Physicists don&apos;t have the best dress sense,&quot; Rachel laughs. Indeed, it&apos;s all pretty casual. There are lots of clubs for those inclined and lots of winter sports, although some prefer to spend their spare time coding or doing robotics. Rachel asks me if I fancy some pilates at lunchtime, but I want to go and see the little office where Tim Berners-Lee invented the web. Cern has also given us cloud computing. It proves to be a hassle, however, to actually get online, and I have to get approval. &quot;Cern is under constant attack from hackers.&quot; When I ask most people what they miss, or what they have given up to be at Cern, they look bewildered. It seems a love of physics goes hand in hand with a love of skiing and snowboarding. They love the fact their children are in local schools and are bilingual. Lucy Lockwood (HR systems analyst) has two small children, who her husband looks after, and says she doesn&apos;t have a social life, but she loves being &quot;in\u00a0this temple of physics&quot;. The problem I hear of over and over is that when a couple are both physicists or engineers, it can mean only one person gets the job they both want. Right across Cern there is movement between different roles: physicists become engineers. Everyone on an experiment will do overnight shifts in the control room. All this produces a less hierarchical way of working. It is this flattening out of traditional structures that makes this place special, as well as the daily and huge international co-operation. Scientists whose countries are in conflict work together, Palestinians besides Israelis. Steve McMahon also explains: &quot;Remuneration is not an issue. I may be working alongside eastern Europeans, for instance. We\u00a0just don&apos;t talk about money&quot;. The fact that the director is well paid, but not on a mega CEO/banker-type salary, helps this sense of common purpose. People are valued for their ideas and their ability to work across projects. &quot;Hans Blix was here last week,&quot; someone will say casually. &quot;Well, he would be. He is interested in Thorium.&quot; Or, &quot;No one knew what to wear when the Dalai Lama came, so we wore Cern T shirts&quot;. The philosophy of knowledge transfer and access to data adds to the openness of the place. The only real sense I get of hierarchy is when people talk in awe of Nobel prizewinners. If you get one of those, you can do what you like. Smoke cigars in your office. Jakob Steinberger, who won the Nobel in 1988 for his discovery of the muon neutrino, will be\u00a0hanging out in canteen with every one else. &quot;Its like a college. But with no\u00a0undergraduates,&quot; says Alex Brown (development office). I soon stop asking people about their qualifications. &quot;Only an obnoxious so-and-so would announce that they have a PhD. Best to assume whoever you are talking to does.&quot;     'This is a large and shifting community' \u2026 Suzanne Moore in the newspaper shop at Cern. Photograph: Stefan Pangritz for the Guardian    But if demarcations between nations and jobs dissolve under the mantra &quot;We\u00a0are all here for science&quot;, this is still a strange place to be, a transient society. Alex explains the psychology: &quot;You have to have a new model of friendship. You make friends, and in six months you have a whole new group and your best friend has gone.&quot; Instead this class of international young scientists uses Twitter, Facebook and Skype. Claire, who is wearing a bat on her headband for Halloween, is planning to paint herself blue for the evening&apos;s festivities. &quot;You know, the Na&apos;vi out of Avatar,&quot; she explains. If\u00a0you want to bust the image of the average physicist, look no further. With funding from South Africa and Taiwan, she has a small baby whom her husband, an IT project manager, looks after. Still, there is a Cern bubble that is hard to escape. Because Geneva has the UN, there is a large ex-pat community. Hugo Day (Marie Curie fellow) says he meets locals as he speaks the international language of heavy metal, and is honest about the limitations. &quot;It is the place to be for physics. If you want cutting-edge, straight-up computer science, it would be IBM or Google.&quot; Now an engineer, after some years at Cern he is quite proud he doesn&apos;t ski. Ice\u00a0climbing is his thing. And zombies. Everyone I talk to bristles when I ask if, having found the Higgs, research has now stalled. The LHC is on &quot;the long shutdown&quot;. The Higgs boson has actually thrown up more unknowns, from anti-matter and dark matter to supersymmetry and the inability of the standard model to incorporate gravity. All this work and these massive machines are about proving theories that are decades old. This is a long game. I go underground to see the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) particle detector, a massively complex but gorgeous piece of mega-engineering. We also see the AMS (Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer), and watching people sitting in a control room analysing data as it comes down from the international space station is fairly mind-blowing. A young Jordanian shows us round and tells us about Sesame, a\u00a0major new research facility in the Middle East bringing in scientists from Egypt, Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian territories and Iran, among others. Its\u00a0object is partly to promote peace through scientific co-operation. Steve McMahon (Atlas upgrade tracker leader) commutes between Cern and the Rutherford Appleton lab in Oxfordshire, and like everyone here, is thankful for easyJet. He takes me round Atlas. He seems to know everyone, stopping to chat to an old Israeli, pipe-smoking professor. As he talks about everything from luminosity to his four\u00a0children, to explaining the new dimensions and all the other bits of the\u00a0universe to be explored (most of it) a\u00a0Russian guy knocks on his door excitedly. He has had some good news on funding. &quot;You know people say, &apos;It&apos;s\u00a0not rocket science&apos;?&quot; says Steve. &quot;Well,\u00a0it is. He is a rocket scientist.&quot; I tell him I like the big statue of Shiva in the grounds \u2013 the old &quot;cosmic dancer&quot; \u2013 but I sense a lot of people don&apos;t like big expressions of cultural difference, never mind faith. Everything is for a higher purpose, and that purpose is phsyics. I have never been anywhere where I\u00a0felt such a sense of shared purpose. It is in the canteen at lunchtime, where folk whizz about with trays of food and seemingly no system, as if they were crazed particles themselves, so that one fears a collision. But there is none \u2013 just this sense of charged intensity. People talk passionately in every tongue about the problems they are solving. Everywhere one feels these minds working collectively and intently, and even someone like me, who is not really up to speed on quarks, strangeness, mass and gluons, can pick up this\u00a0terrific buzz. What is the universe made of? Matter and force. Or, here, concentration and caffeine. And a new kind of excitement. Real energy. I begin to understand a little of what Lucy said earlier: &quot;We are\u00a0all here for what Cern is doing. This\u00a0is a beautiful thing.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 8 November to correct the name of Leonard from The Big Bang Theory The Guardian and Observer are media partners of the London Science Museum&apos;s Collider exhibition, which opens on Wednesday and runs until May 2014.

But of particular note to Zlatan might be the fact that both Cristiano Ronaldo (in Rwanda) and Lionel Messi (also in Rwanda but also in Mozambique) got there first. And nor is the Paris St-Germain striker the first Swede to get the honour. A set released to coincide with Euro 1992 featured Gunnar Nordahl edging towards Phil-Jones-face territory, Tomas Brolin tearing away from Lothar Matth\u00e4us, and a couple of years later Swedish letter writers could spend a krona or two on Martin Dahlin having his shorts pulled while Klas Ingesson watches on. And while Ibrahimovic&apos;s stamp is a fairly straightforward affair, in Austria back in 2006 it was not just Franz Beckenbauer on a stamp but Andy Warhol&apos;s pop art portrait of Der Kaiser. A trawl of the varied and numerous stamp collecting sites brings up hundreds more, with a particular favourite of ours being the strangely selected collection from the Isle of Man featuring Dennis Irwin&apos;s back, Luis Figo&apos;s back, David Beckham&apos;s back, Thierry Henry&apos;s back and Michael Owen&apos;s armpits. But for the nirvana of football-stamp fusion we can do no more than point you in the direction of one of the world wide web&apos;s hidden gems \u2013 www.footballphilately.com. This collection of British football stamps is well worth a look, as is this blogpost on the 1994 FA Cup collection on the tiny Scottish islands of Great and Little Bernera (which includes presumably the only stamp in the world to feature Ray Parlour in a tracksuit). And footballphilately.com also features what is surely the greatest football stamp of all time. The Austrian postal service, as shown by that Beckenbauer effort, seems always to have had something of a knack with its sporting stamps and the arrival of the European Championships in the country in 2008 gave them the opportunity to roll out a couple of impressive innovations. First came the circular stamp designed to look like a 2D version of the official adidas Europass tournament match ball made from the same material as the official adidas Europass tournament match ball. It followed that up with something even better \u2013 the Andreas Herzog lenticular stamp. Using the same technology as that most commonly seen on those novelty rulers in museum gift shops, the postal service got footage of Herzog&apos;s 1997 goal against Sweden that took the country to the 1998 World Cup. Thanks to the use of 48 still TV images and that groundbreaking lenticular technology the public could both send a letter and watch Herzog&apos;s strike from three different angles. But any one thinking of sticking the Herzog stamp on the front of a Christmas card probably had second thoughts \u2013 it cost \u20ac5.45 and measured 6.5cm by 4.7cm. KEEPING THE FAITH &quot;After Di Canio and Holloway departed relegation-threatened clubs relatively early in the season, it seems as if the first action for clubs threatened by the drop is to change the manager,&quot; writes Matt Cooke. &quot;In the Premier League era how many clubs have been relegated without resorting to changing their manager at any point during the season?&quot; There&apos;s nothing the Knowledge enjoys more than an in-depth trawl through the dusty annals of football history but on this occasion readers Pete Tomlin and Colin Owens have done all the leg work. Thanks to both. The results are rather surprising. Of the 64 teams relegated in the (apologies for the following phrase) &quot;Premier League era&quot; 35 stuck by their manager throughout the season while 29 made a managerial change (voluntarily or otherwise). Here&apos;s the full list of relegated teams who did not change manager during the season:   1992-93: Crystal Palace (Steve Coppell), Middlesbrough (Lennie Lawrence), Nottingham Forest (Brian Clough),1993-94: Sheffield United (Dave Bassett), Oldham Athletic (Joe Royle), Swindon Town (John Gorman),1994-95: Crystal Palace (Alan Smith)1995-96: Manchester City (Alan Ball), QPR (Ray Wilkins),1996-97: Sunderland (Peter Reid), Middlesbrough (Bryan Robson),1997-98: Bolton Wanderers (Colin Todd), Barnsley (Danny Wilson),1998-99: Charlton Athletic (Alan Curbishley),1999-00: Watford (Graham Taylor)2000-01: Manchester City (Joe Royle), Coventry City (Gordon Strachan),2001-02: Ipswich Town (George Burley),2002-03: West Bromwich Albion (Gary Megson),2003-04: Leicester City (Micky Adams), Wolverhampton Wanderers (Dave Jones),2004-05: Crystal Palace (Iain Dowie), Norwich City (Nigel Worthington),2005-06: Birmingham City (Steve Bruce), West Bromwich Albion (Bryan Robson),2006-07: Sheffield United (Neil Warnock), Watford (Aidy Boothroyd)2007-08: Reading (Steve Coppell),2008-09: Middlesbrough (Gareth Southgate), West Bromwich Albion (Tony Mowbray),2009-10: NONE2010-11: Birmingham City (Alex McLeish), Blackpool (Ian Holloway),2011-12: Bolton Wanderers (Owen Coyle), Blackburn Rovers (Steve Kean),2012-13: Wigan Athletic (Roberto Mart\u00ednez).  THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE \u2026 &quot;As of this evening Rangers in Scottish League One are absolutely dominating the competition: P11, W11, D0, L0 GD39 PTS33,&quot; writes Yuval Weber. &quot;What is interesting is that seven of the other nine clubs have negative goal differentials and the other two are +5 and +2. Has there ever been a league in which all but one club have negative goal differentials, reflecting a single club that was far too good for the competition and doled out regular drubbings?&quot; Indeed there has, Yuval. In Brazil in 1906 only the winners of the Championship of Sao Paulo, Germania, had a positive goal difference. Every other side were in the red. Although in this case every other side in fact means only Internacional and Paulistano, with three teams pulling out of what was already only a six-team league before the season&apos;s end. Elsewhere, in Costa Rica in 1944, the champions Orion FC were the only team in the league to have a positive goal difference in a six-team league, with the bottom club Universidad de Costa Rica the only team bar Orion not in the red. And in Guam in 2009-10 only the champions, the aptly named Quality Distributors, and runners-up, Paintco Strykers, scored more than they conceded. But as the leagues get bigger, it is harder to find similar examples. The best we can do is the Hungarian top division in 1917-18, where only the top four of 12 teams netted more than they conceded over the course of the season. And on the other side of the coin, the ever wonderful rsssf.com reveals that six teams have won their respective national championships with a negative goal difference. The Brazilians Coritiba FC, Qatari club Al-Rayyan, Walter Ferreti who won the Nicaraguan championship, CD Plaza Amador from Panama and the Taiwanese club Taiwan 2007 all managed it but the most remarkable team to do so must be the 1986 South Korean champions, POSCO Atoms. In a two-stage tournament they won the first stage but finished second bottom in the next stage. The winners of each stage advanced to play in the final, where POSCO ground out a 2-1 victory over two legs against Lucky-Goldstar Hwangso. Not only did they end up champions with a negative goal difference, over the course of the season they won only six matches, drawing nine and losing seven. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;Have any players ever used a corner flag, a goalpost or an advertising hoarding to attack an opponent?&quot; inquired Pedro Salinas in those sepia-tinged days of 2007. Step forward Canada&apos;s Paul Peschisolido, who flipped a corner flag into an El Salvador player&apos;s face during a World Cup qualifier in 1997 and duly picked up a red card for his troubles. &quot;I was kicked a few times and the referee wasn&apos;t giving anything, while every challenge we made seemed to result in a foul,&quot; explained Pesch afterwards. &quot;I was getting very annoyed and frustrated so I decided to elbow one of their players. It was right in the corner and in fact I elbowed the corner flag into his face.&quot; Martin Keown managed the next best thing in January 2002, chucking a corner flag into the stands during Arsenal&apos;s 1-1 draw at Elland Road. Early in the game Keown conceded a corner; as he got up he grabbed the flag and casually lobbed it behind him into the front rows of fans. Despite uproar from the supporters, the FA eventually decided he had not intended to hit them, and did not enforce any punishment.

The faint steel stripe across the horizon was the only hint of dawn, but loading up the C130 cargo plane early meant it could land at Tacloban in first light, maximising its trips. The previous day, a brief delay had caused the cancellation of one of only five relief deliveries from Cebu air base. The flight&apos;s manifest had just been torn up so fresh personnel could be deployed to the shattered city to maintain security and deliver aid. &quot;The men have been on the ground for three days with no food and no sleep. If they get sick they&apos;re no help to anyone,&quot; Mison said, running through the list of challenges. &quot;We hoped to have two Ospreys from the US yesterday; they&apos;re not here yet. We have 160 people to get out of the city. Every person we have on board on the way in is one less piece of aid.&quot; The scribbled schedule on a whiteboard made the mathematical problem plain: &quot;C130: Ferry relief goods \u2013 220 sacks assorted goods: 18,876lbs 40 boxes Nature Spring [water]: 1,584lb&quot; There are well over half a million displaced people in the disaster zone, and many more affected by typhoon Haiyan. A C130 can carry 25,000-30,000lbs (11-13 tonnes) in supplies, depending on passengers. The Philippines owns only three, and one was flying from Manila. Add in loading and flight times, and airstrips incapable of operating outside daylight, and the result was a desperate shortfall in relief. &quot;There are just too many requirements for food, water, medicine. We need more transport,&quot; said Major General Romeo Poquiz. But less than 36 hours later, on Thursday morning, nine C130s stood on the runway along with the anticipated Ospreys, which have vertical take off and landing abilities that are valuable in such difficult conditions. Others were in the air, en route to Leyte and Eastern Samar provinces, loaded with water, high energy biscuits, tins of sardines and sacks of rice. In another small step forward, they are able to land in Tacloban after darkness falls, too. The operations building was crammed thanks to the sudden arrival of international assistance en masse. Indonesia, Australia and Taiwan had sent cargo planes and crews. Israeli doctors were clambering on to buses that would drive them to Bogo in northern Cebu to set up a mobile hospital. A Belgian team will focus on water purification and medical care; South Koreans have arrived in Tacloban to work on disinfection. The change was &quot;enormous and heartwarming&quot; said Lt Col Butch Rivera, spokesperson for the air force. Hours later, the USS Washington arrived off eastern Samar province with four accompanying ships, 5,000 crew and more than 80 aircraft. The carrier&apos;s 21 helicopters will help to transport emergency supplies to remote areas; its vessels have already ferried 1,920 gallons of water and three food pallets to Tacloban, with more supplies going to Guiuan, where Haiyan first made landfall. The carrier group will be followed in around 10 days by Britain&apos;s HMS Illustrious, bearing 900 crew and seven helicopters. &quot;You can see the devastation, the suffering and it&apos;s quite clear that we are going to need long-term help for those people,&quot; said David Cameron, announcing the deployment.

The decision means that only 22 countries in the world now recognise Taiwan, which China regards as part of its territory. They are mostly small and struggling economies in Latin America, the Caribbean and the south Pacific. Gambia&apos;s surprise move was apparently a personal decision by President Yahya Jammeh, one of Africa&apos;s most autocratic and idiosyncratic rulers, who last month also announced that Gambia had quit the Commonwealth. Jammeh&apos;s office said: &quot;This decision has been taken in our strategic national interest. We are proud that we have been a very strong and reliable partner of the Republic of China [Taiwan] for the past 18 years, the results of which are there for every Taiwanese to see.&quot; The statement added: &quot;Despite the end of diplomatic ties with Taiwan, we will still remain friends with the people of Taiwan.&quot; Taiwan expressed dismay at the announcement. &quot;Our government express shock and regret that Gambian president Yahya Jammeh sent a letter to our embassy in Gambia on 14 November to inform us [of] the immediate termination of ties,&quot; THE vice-foreign minister, Simon Ko, said in Taipei. &quot;We think this is Jammeh&apos;s personal decision.&quot; China&apos;s foreign ministry said it had no contact with authorities in Gambia and declined to say if it had now established formal ties with the west African state. Spokesman Hong Lei told a press conference: &quot;We learned about this from the foreign media. China has had no contact with Gambia ahead of this.&quot; China and Taiwan have been governed separately since the communists won China&apos;s civil war in 1949. The nationalists fled across a 110 mile-wide strait to Taiwan. The two sides then competed hard to win diplomatic allies, frequently offering monetary incentives. China still insists that Taiwan has no right to recognition but there has been an unofficial diplomatic truce since the signing of trade and economic agreements in 2008. Most African countries recognised the Taipei government initially but their number has steadily shrunk and the continent has seen massive Chinese investment. Five years ago, Malawi announced that it had switched allegiance to Beijing, reportedly after being offered several billions dollars in aid as an incentive. Since then Chinese contractors have built Malawi&apos;s parliament building, national conference centre, presidential villas, school and university buildings, a five-star hotel and miles of road. Swaziland, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, and Burkina Faso are Taiwan&apos;s only remaining diplomatic allies in Africa. But S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe announced this week that China planned to open a trade mission to promote projects there, though they did not indicate whether this would affect diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Swaziland, however, continues to hold out despite the potential cost to its desperately weak economy. A recent report by the UK&apos;s Chatham House commented: &quot;Swaziland&apos;s long-standing ties with Taiwan are likely to continue, preventing the emergence of closer relations with China and the investment this could bring.&quot; Other countries maintaining diplomatic ties with Taiwan include the tiny Pacific island states of Nauru and Palau, as well as the Vatican City, Paraguay, Panama, Haiti, Nicaragua and Belize. Zhang Zhexin, who studies Taiwan policy at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, said Beijing would deal with Gambia in a low-key way to avoid upsetting Taiwan. &quot;We won&apos;t take the initiative to spread this news around,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;This has nothing to do with cross-strait ties.

Among those lucky enough to have jobs, real wages have been falling for most since the 1970s. Republicans have a solution: get the government out of the way, then sit back and wait for an entrepreneurial explosion to launch the economy to unprecedented prosperity. Democrats have a different solution: trust them to set up exactly the right structure of economic and social policies, then sit back and wait for an entrepreneurial explosion to launch the economy to unprecedented prosperity. Most Americans wisely reject both solutions. The Republican approach requires faith in a magical &quot;invisible hand&quot;. The Democratic approach requires that too, but also a faith in policy makers&apos; ability to properly manipulate an infinite set of unpredictable economic and social variables to free the invisible hand to do its magical work. The Republican theory is much more accessible to people who never took a class in economics: &quot;the government is the problem, get rid of government interference&quot;. The Democratic theory requires more fealty to complex models and elite academics. Elizabeth Warren was one of those academic policy makers. But while the Democratic establishment was being led down Wall Street like a bull by the nose, Warren was sticking up for common sense and ordinary consumers. She came to prominence on the Tarp oversight panel, where she called for a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to be created. President Obama created the agency, but picked someone more Wall Street friendly than Warren to lead it.  Warren had the last laugh when she became a US senator, and quickly emerged as 2016&apos;s only possible anti-Hillary \u2013 though she insists she is not, at the moment, thinking of running. Elizabeth Warren could defeat Hillary Clinton in the primaries. Barack Obama beat Hillary by merely implying that he would clean up Wall Street. Elizabeth Warren is explicitly crusading to break up too big to fail banks, regulate consumer debt, and block Wall Street bonus excesses.  After the progressive base nominates her, the general electorate will have some practical questions, such as: why will a swarm of small banks be less likely to crash the economy than a few large ones? Anybody willing to think for more than five seconds about the structure of the banking industry will be familiar with the savings and loan debacle, when bad loans in an industry of small banks nearly bring the economy to its knees. Some reasonable voters may ask if it wouldn&apos;t be easier to regulate a few large banks than a sprawling decentralized industry of many small ones. Many voters will have a problem with Warren&apos;s proposed clampdown on the consumer credit industry. To the extent that they even understand what she&apos;s proposing, it&apos;s going to sound like she wants to cut off their access to credit cards, auto loans and mortgages. As irresponsible as the consumer credit industry has been, voters will legitimately want to know how Warren proposes to supply them with a car to get to work when they don&apos;t have the money to pay for one and groceries when a meager paycheck has been spent.  Which brings us to the real issue that American workers care about \u2013 about which neither Warren nor her Republican opponent will have anything credible to say: how do we create high-paying jobs for American workers? The real solution is unfortunately beyond the imagination of almost any Democrat or Republican. The real solution is a massive mobilization of labor and capital to redevelop the US economy \u2013 something that the US and every industrialized country has done before. The great American example is the second world war, when the government worked with the private sector to super-size the national economy in an all-out sprint to reindustrialize an entire nation. More recent examples, taking place under governments of many political persuasions, include Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and China. Europe had two surges of intentional industrialization \u2013 one before the second world war and one after. Like America&apos;s great mobilization, most of Europe&apos;s took place within a liberal democratic framework. All these intentional industrializations and reindustrializations had one thing in common: a society mobilized labor and capital directly, on a massive scale, in the cause of increasing the productivity of the national economy.  Unfortunately, Elizabeth Warren&apos;s new wing of the Democratic party is not even capable of imagining that kind of mobilization. The only way to get from Warren&apos;s policy proposals to jobs and higher wages is through a long and indirect chain of causality. That tortured logic won&apos;t win a presidential election, and it won&apos;t serve as the basis for a viable new direction in American politics."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/19/labour-lord-adonis-high-speed-rail", "publicationDate": "2013-11-19T23:15:00Z", "tags": ["HS2", "Rail transport", "UK news", "Transport policy", "Transport", "Politics", "Travel & leisure", "Business"], "sentences": ["&quot;Since then France, Italy, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, South Korea and Taiwan have followed suit."], "title": "Labour's Adonis asks Lords to back high speed rail scheme", "article": "Labour on Tuesday signalled its strong support for Britain&apos;s first high speed rail line north of London when Lord Adonis, the father of the scheme, overwhelmingly endorsed the project in the Lords.

Many SMEs, however, remain apprehensive about exporting for the first time. The UKTI&apos;s National Export Week, which took place between 11 November and 15 November, aimed to change SME owners&apos; minds, holding workshops and seminars across the country to highlight overseas opportunities. With a daunting array of countries to choose from, how do you know which markets are right for your product or service? We went along to the UKTI&apos;s Explore Export event at the Oval in London to find out what three of the world&apos;s biggest markets \u2013 Brazil, India and China \u2013 had to offer small business exporters. Brazil Matt Woods, deputy consul general and head of UKTI in Rio de Janeiro: Brazil is not for beginners. Brazil is still growing, but it&apos;s not as fast as it used to be. The drivers are still there though \u2013 it still has a population of 200 million people or so with 40 million lifted out of poverty in the last decade. So you have this rising middle class which is driving consumption. There&apos;s also a growing focus on the country through the World Cup and Olympics. It&apos;s a unique selling point for British companies, not just for those in the sports sector. It&apos;s quite a good time for Brazil. Other big markets in South America are easier to break into. Portuguese is the language spoken there and there&apos;s very little Spanish or English. You have to have access to Portuguese speaking resources and for a small business that&apos;s an investment. There&apos;s another investment to be made in personal visits. On average it&apos;s about three visits before you break into having productive conversations with someone. It&apos;s therefore quite a big investment. Oil and gas is by far the biggest sector of interest for British businesses in Brazil. Over the past two and half years we&apos;ve helped British companies sell \u00a3900m worth of contracts in oil, gas and related marine sectors. So it just dwarfs the other sectors in terms of value. You have the big boys such as Shell and BP, but there are also medium-sized engineering companies that are very specialised. Do your research first and then think about your market entry strategy. Almost certainly that will involve some sort of partnership with a Brazilian entity, whether that&apos;s an agent or a distributor. India Graham Snape, UKTI international trade sector adviser: Although India looks to be incredibly poor, there is economic activity taking place and they [consumers] have aspirations. A lot of those aspirations are Western based. There is an interest in genuine British products. If you are selling your product into the British middle classes then there&apos;s a similar market growing in India, although it might take a few years to get going. Retail is a big sector for India. They [consumers] have aspirations in IT, as well as the mobile phone business and all that&apos;s associated with that \u2013 such as apps, phone covers and so on. They are looking for something that makes a statement about them as individuals. Being overawed by the size of the country is one of the challenges that SMEs face, as well as picking the wrong point of entry for sales. I&apos;ve got clients who have avoided places like Delhi and Mumbai but have been effective in Pune, which is smaller. Small companies will find company partners in those areas that are themselves relatively ill-exposed to exporting. China Chris Lowsley, business adviser for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan: China today is a different animal compared to five years ago. Then it was about producing what the world wanted to buy. Today, China&apos;s wealth has created an enormous boom in domestic demand. That&apos;s one driver. Another is the growing difference between the rural population and the urban population. That&apos;s moved from 17% to over 25% of Chinese now living in cities, creating an enormous bubble of demand. Food-related products are another strong area in China. They are prepared to pay a premium for quality western goods, such as food, medicine, and cosmetics, because they know they are going to be healthy and safe. Finding the right partner is absolutely critical. The UKTI can help through our services. Most selling in China is done on who you know and who you have a contract with. The relationship in selling is everything. It might take you a long time or you might be lucky with your first hit. Companies have got to look at themselves and ask, &quot;What is unique and special about my product?&quot; It&apos;s a very competitive marketplace. The one big area exploding in China is online purchasing. If you think of China&apos;s under thirties, they are buying more online proportionally than we are in the west.

With the media running hot, breathlessly reporting every syllable of outrage it can find in Jakarta, it\u2019s easy to believe that this is the biggest crisis we\u2019ve ever faced and that it will take years to repair the damage. As Indonesia has withdrawn its ambassador and downgraded military and intelligence cooperation in the wake of the Snowden eavesdropping revelations, it\u2019s unsurprising that Tony Abbott has put other issues on hold while he tries to deal with the fallout. But a bit of perspective at this stage can be refreshing. This is not the greatest diplomatic crisis to face Australia \u2013 not even close. It\u2019s not even the greatest crisis to beset Australia-Indonesian relations. Far from it \u2013 Australia\u2019s bilateral relations with its northern neighbours have historically been crisis-prone, as have bilateral relations among those neighbours. Diplomatic spats are part of the landscape in our part of the world. 20 years ago, then prime minister Paul Keating upset his Malaysian counterpart by suggesting that those leaders who had not attended the first APEC Leaders\u2019 Summit were \u201crecalcitrants\u201d. His successor, John Howard, angered Beijing by voicing his support for the dispatch of US Navy aircraft carrier groups to the Taiwan Straits in the face of hostile missile launches by the Chinese in a bid to intimidate Taiwan\u2019s first Presidential election. Australia and Indonesia almost came to blows during the East Timor intervention in 1999, and in 2001, then president Megawati Sukarnoputri refused to take phone calls from Howard over an asylum-seeker stand-off. Kevin Rudd faced his own crisis with China over his \u201cZhengyou\u201d speech in Beijing, and with Indonesia over the Oceanic Viking. There\u2019s one lesson to be drawn from all of these crises: that despite their occurrence, relations were quickly restored to a pragmatic, balanced mean. Given the sound and the fury at the time, it\u2019s astonishing how quickly each storm passed, and positive relations restored. Just five years after Australian troops led an intervention into East Timor, and three after Megawati refused to take phone calls, Howard and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono\u00a0spontaneously embraced \u2013 with genuine mutual affection \u2013 on the sidelines of an APEC meeting. The reason is that the big strategic forces in the region are bringing the interests of Australia and its Southeast Asian neighbours closer and closer together. Despite their occasional spats, there is an underlying realisation that Australia and the countries of Southeast Asia need each other, and are gradually developing their solidarity amidst the great forces taking place around them. What are these strategic forces? Simply put, they are the contradictory forces of growing economic interdependence and rising security rivalries among the region\u2019s great powers: China, the US, Japan and India. Their rivalries mean that they can\u2019t build genuine collaboration around their economic linkages; their interdependence means their rivalry can never be resolved by all-out war. Instead, they have begun to compete for the loyalties of smaller countries in this crucial region that separates the world\u2019s two most important oceans: the Pacific and the Indian Oceans. As a result, the dilemmas and pressures faced by Australia in maintaining positive relations among the great powers are shared by all of the other states of Southeast Asia. There is genuine concern that countries such as Laos and Cambodia appear to have thrown in their lot with Beijing, as well as some discomfort that the Philippines has been gradually building its expectations of American support for its confrontations with China in the South China Sea. Amidst this background tension, Australia and Indonesia \u2013 and Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, etc \u2013 have a real interest that their neighbours maintain a pragmatic balance between the jealous great powers.\u00a0 Then why the outrage in Jakarta? Both Yudhoyono\u00a0and his foreign minister are sensitive to criticisms that they\u2019re been too pro-western in their policies and attitudes. What they didn\u2019t bank on was the media\u2019s serial exploitation of the Snowden revelations, stirring the nationalist pot just when the first phase of the crisis had begun to die down, with Yudhoyono\u00a0and Natelagawa probably feeling they\u2019d hit just the right notes of anger. One gets the feeling that the outrage has somewhat slipped the noose of what they had expected or were comfortable with, and that the crisis has assumed a life of its own. The take-out message for the Abbott government? This too, will pass. The structural forces are all aligned behind a restoration of pragmatic and close Indonesia-Australia relations."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/23/china-airspace-restrictions-japanese-senkaku", "publicationDate": "2013-11-23T10:58:32Z", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan", "Senkaku Islands"], "sentences": ["South Korea and Taiwan also claim the Senkaku islands."], "title": "China imposes airspace restrictions over Japan-controlled Senkaku islands", "article": "China has tried to establish its authority over Japanese-controlled islands in the East China sea by demanding that all aircraft flying in the region obey its rules or face &quot;emergency defensive measures&quot;.

The ministry said all aircraft entering the zone must notify Chinese authorities and warned they would be subject to emergency military measures if they did not identify themselves or obey orders. It said it would &quot;identify, monitor, control and react to&quot; any air threats or unidentified flying objects coming from the sea. &quot;China&apos;s armed forces will adopt defensive emergency measures to respond to aircraft that do not cooperate in the identification or refuse to follow the instructions,&quot; it added. Any military dispute between China and Japan over the islands would involve the United States because of the terms of the second world war settlement with Japan.

There have also been several incidents involving military aircraft flying close to each other. In October, Chinese military aircraft flew near Japan three days in a row, and Japan scrambled fighter jets each time in response. Protests erupted throughout China last year to denounce the Japanese government&apos;s purchase of the islands from private ownership.

The Obama administration weighed in after China moved to in effect &quot;rope off&quot; the seas and skies around the disputed Japanese-administered Senkaku islands in the east China Sea. In a tough statement reflecting the surprise and alarm felt in Washington and Tokyo at China&apos;s perceived sudden escalation of the dispute, Chuck Hagel, defence secretary, said the US was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; at the development, in which China appears to be trying to control who can enter and leave the area. The imposition of the zone was a &quot;destabilising attempt to alter the status quo in the region&quot;, Hagel said. &quot;This unilateral action increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations\u00a0... We are in close consultation with our allies and partners in the region, including Japan. We remain steadfast in our commitments.&quot;      Hagel reminded Beijing that the remote Senkaku islands, known as Diaoyu in China, are covered by the 1952 US-Japan security treaty, under which the US is committed to fighting alongside Japan to repel any &quot;common danger&quot;. On Monday China&apos;s foreign ministry said it had complained to the US about its &quot;irresponsible remarks&quot;.  Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said in a statement China had asked the US through its ambassador, Gary Locke, &quot;to correct its mistakes and stop making irresponsible remarks on China&quot;. Defence ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said the ministry had complained to the US embassy&apos;s military attache on Sunday evening. Japan&apos;s deputy chief cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato told reporters on Monday that China&apos;s declaration had escalated a tense situation. &quot;It can invite an unexpected occurrence and it is a very dangerous thing as well,&quot; he said. &quot;The step just announced unjustly interferes with the freedom to fly above the open sea, which is a general principle under the international law. The measure is not enforceable to our country.&quot; Washington&apos;s swift intervention showed just how easily a little local difficulty in the volatile east Asian region could potentially trigger a superpower clash. The Senkaku stand-off is but one of several similar disputes pitting a more assertive China against its less powerful neighbours. Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan (all US allies) are \u2013 like Japan \u2013 enmeshed in arguments with Beijing over relatively obscure but potentially strategic bits of maritime real estate. These numerous flashpoints have led the Japanese government to describe the regional security environment as &quot;increasingly severe&quot;. In response, Tokyo has been busily building up mutual defence and security ties across south-east Asia, and with Australia and India, as a hedge against Beijing. For its part, China has sought to enlist Laos, Cambodia, North Korea and Myanmar as de facto buffer states while projecting itself as a rival to the US as a &quot;blue-water&quot; Pacific power. Japan has denounced the zone set up by China on Saturday as &quot;totally unacceptable&quot;, and indicated that aircraft from its self-defence force would ignore Beijing&apos;s attempt to oblige aeroplanes to obtain its permission before entering. Fumio Kishida, foreign minister, warned that China&apos;s action &quot;could well lead to an unforeseen situation&quot;. He called the development &quot;very dangerous&quot;. Hagel said that US forces in the Pacific theatre, including those based in Japan and South Korea, would also ignore China&apos;s strictures. China&apos;s foreign ministry called Japan&apos;s objections &quot;absolutely groundless and unacceptable&quot;. It said it had made solemn representations to the Japanese embassy in Beijing. The Chinese government-run Xinhua news agency published map co-ordinates for what it called the &quot;East China sea air defence identification zone&quot; covering most of the sea and the skies over the islands. It said China&apos;s armed forces would take &quot;defensive emergency measures&quot; against aircraft that failed to identify themselves properly or follow its radio instructions. Xinhua claimed the &quot;air zone could contribute to regional peace and security by curbing the increasing rampancy of Japan&apos;s right-wing forces, as well as the continuous and dangerous provocations of Japanese politicians, which even Washington should be vigilant against&quot;. The statement was an apparent reference to Shinzo Abe, Japan&apos;s conservative prime minister, who was elected last December on a platform of standing up for Japan&apos;s rights. Abe, who says he is intent on making a &quot;proactive contribution to peace&quot;, has been denounced in China and South Korea as a reckless nationalist and historical revisionist. Although China and Japan share two-way trade worth $250bn (\u00a3150bn) a year and maintain many other bilateral links, Abe and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, have yet to hold a summit meeting, and other high-level contacts remain frozen. The dispute over the Senkakus, situated south-west of the Japanese mainland, dates back to 1971 when China claimed sovereignty. Up to that point, the islands had been under unchallenged Japanese control since the 19th century, although Taiwan also has a claim.The row escalated last year when Tokyo effectively nationalised some of the chain, purchasing two islands from private owners. The takeover provoked street protests in China and furious official condemnation. Since then there have been almost daily incursions by Chinese fishing boats and other non-military vessels. Although tiny in size, the Senkakus are thought to sit on top of valuable energy deposits. But analysts say the outcome has broad implications for regional security, given that an ever more assertive China is prosecuting similar disputes with several other neighbours. Akio Takahara, professor of international relations and law at Tokyo university, said: &quot;[Senkaku] must be viewed as an international issue, not just a bilateral issue... and it is very, very dangerous. They [China] must stop the provocations. If Japan did buckle, it would send a very bad message.&quot; In a foretaste of what could happen in the weeks ahead, China sent an air patrol into the zone shortly after the official announcement. Later on Saturday afternoon, Japan scrambled fighter jets after two Chinese reconnaissance planes appeared over the East China sea."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/nov/25/music-spam-carlsen-chess", "publicationDate": "2013-11-25T07:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Apple", "Samsung", "Microsoft", "Google"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s Acer struggles to redefine its niche &gt;&gt; FT.com  All PC companies are struggling as consumers spend money on new smartphones and tablets instead of PCs."], "title": "Boot up: music spammers (yes!), chess v computers, Apple-Samsung jury speaks, and more", "article": "A quick burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team How we cope with spammers, fakers and cloners &gt;&gt; The Echo Nest Blog  The Echo Nest knows approximately 2.4 million artists as part of our database of music information, which is the largest in the world.

Magnus Carlsen&apos;s win in chess championship shows powerful role of computers &gt;&gt; WSJ.com  When [chess computing] engines suggest surprising moves, or arrangements of pieces that look &quot;ugly&quot; to human sensibilities, they are often seeing more deeply into the game than their users. They are not perfect; sometimes long-term strategy still eludes them. But players have learned from computers that some kinds of chess positions are playable, or even advantageous, even though they might violate general principles. Having seen how machines go about attacking and especially defending, humans have become emboldened to try the same ideas.  Computers have gone so far that the top human players are now those who most often play the moves that would be chosen by the best engines (which sport names like Houdini, HIARCS and Rybka). Magnus Carlsen&apos;s biographers dub him the &quot;hero of the computer era.&quot; Indeed, a study published on ChessBase.com earlier this year showed that in the tournament Mr. Carlsen won to qualify for the world championship match, he played more like a computer than any of his opponents.  Nanoparticle-infused speaker could mean better sound in a smaller package &gt;&gt; ExtremeTech  A team of researchers from Sweden&apos;s KTH Royal Institute of Technology have created a new kind of loudspeaker that relies on nanoparticle-infused membranes to generate sound without need of a permanent magnet.  The main constituent of the membrane is cellulose fiber -- the polysaccharide component of plant cell walls. Researchers mixed the cellulose fibers in solution with ferromagnetic salts at 90 degree Celsius, then left the mixture to bond over the course of two months. The remaining water was drained at the end of this period to reveal a hydrogel (a hydrophilic collection of polymers) composed of magnetic cellulose fibers.

On the third - Samsung&apos;s $230m in profits - they &quot;butted heads,&quot; according to Colleen Allen, the former U.S. military medic who served as forewoman.  Samsung had argued that there were operating costs associated with those profits - $178m, to be exact - and that to be fair the jury ought to reduce Samsung&apos;s profits of $230m by $178m.  Allen didn&apos;t buy it. She agreed with Davis that &quot;absolutely none of it should come out,&quot; because Samsung hadn&apos;t provided evidence to show that all those operating costs were associated with the devices at issue in the case.

A ministry spokesman earlier said it had lodged representations with the US ambassador. &quot;We reiterate that the purpose of China&apos;s approach is to defend national sovereignty and territorial airspace security, maintain the order of airspace flight, and is an effective exercise of our right of self defence,&quot; defence ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said in a statement. He urged the US to &quot;not take sides, not make inappropriate remarks and not give the wrong signal to Japan and encourage [its] risky behaviour&quot;. Tensions over the islets escalated last year when Japan bought three of them from a private landowner, saying it was trying to prevent nationalists from purchasing them. China accused it of changing the status quo and there were widespread anti-Japanese protests. Behind the dispute lies broader concern in the region about China&apos;s growing power and assertiveness, particularly on maritime issues. On the Japanese side, Abe has a hawkish reputation and has sought to beef up defence capabilities since taking office almost a year ago. &quot;Xi Jinping is developing foreign policy with a great power mindset and people need to get their heads around that,&quot; said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, Asia-Pacific director at the US Institute of Peace. &quot;They don&apos;t foresee any real negative consequences [from the zone]. They certainly didn&apos;t predict the level of pushback [from the US] \u2013 but they don&apos;t feel they need bother to budge. Since Japan does not admit the dispute they are under no pressure to have direct talks with Japan.&quot; But she added: &quot;I think there are a lot of people in China who think they can control escalation. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s the case necessarily. &quot;An unexpected aerial encounter certainly carries greater risk of a clash than anything maritime. The risks are far greater when there are reduced decision-making times and the like.&quot; Earlier this year, Japan scrambled jets after Chinese planes and an unidentified drone flew near the disputed islands. Western diplomats have said they are concerned that China has underestimated both Japan&apos;s maritime capabilities and US commitment to supporting Japan.

In its announcement on Saturday, China&apos;s defence ministry said it would set up other such zones when preparations were finalised.

The Chinese did not in any way attempt to challenge the planes\u2019 flight, Crosson said, nor did the pilots announce themselves to any Chinese authorities. China on Wednesday issued an initial muted public response, saying the planes were detected and monitored as they flew through the zone for two hours and 22 minutes. The Chinese defence ministry statement said all such flights would be monitored and asserted that China had the ability to control the airspace, but did not mention Beijing&apos;s threat to take action against aircraft not complying with its instructions. Nick Szechenyi of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies earlier predicted: \u201cYou\u2019ll probably hear a lot of boisterous statements out of China that it\u2019s a provocation.\u201d Beijing often responds to international criticism or perceived slights against its sovereignty by ordering scathing editorials to be published in the state-run press \u2013 though such responses might not come for days. While US navy ships frequently traverse the Taiwan Strait, it is extremely rare for the US military to issue a blatant show of force near Chinese-claimed territory. For years the Pentagon has argued unsuccessfully for a direct military-to-military communications channel to prevent potentially catastrophic misunderstandings in the region. As first reported by the Wall Street Journal, the US air force flew what it said were a pair of B-52 bombers\u00a0from an airbase on Guam over what China calls the Diaoyu Islands and what Japan calls the Senkaku Islands. Both nations claim the chain, as well as oil and gas fields nearby, and both nations have harassed each other\u2019s nationals, at sea and in the air, over perceived disruptions in the status quo. But China\u2019s\u00a0Saturday\u00a0declaration that it had expanded its air defense zone into the East China sea \u2013 with its attendant implication that China will shoot down unauthorised aircraft \u2013 was met with scathing condemnation from Hagel. \u201cWe view this development as a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo in the region,\u201d Hagel said in a statement over the weekend. \u201cThis unilateral action increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations.\u201d Hagel warned China that US military operations in the western Pacific would \u201cnot in any way change\u201d. The flight of the air force planes, even if they were on a long-planned training mission, is the first clear demonstration of Hagel\u2019s declaration. Crosson did not describe the training mission beyond saying the two planes flew from Guam and back. \u201cThis was not a reaction\u201d to China\u2019s expansion of its air defence zone, Crosson said. It is unclear whether China will view it that way. The Chinese foreign ministry\u00a0on Monday condemned Hagel\u2019s remarks as \u201cirresponsible\u201d. The rise of China as a regional military heavyweight has long preoccupied the Pentagon, which has routinely stated sees China as a potential partner. The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, implored China to no avail to establish a direct communications channel between the two militaries to ward off potential misunderstandings. China is expected to participate in a major Pacific wargame alongside the US navy and its regional allies next year. China said in March that it would take part in the Rim of the Pacific exercises\u00a0for the first time, seemingly auguring closer US-Chinese military ties. A comparable US military challenge to Chinese power has not happened for nearly two decades Szechenyi, of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, looked back to the 1996 \u201cTaiwan Strait Crisis\u201d, in which the US sent two aircraft carriers to the Taiwan Strait following a series of Chinese military escalations, as a recent analogue. \u201cThe US has stated repeatedly that it would not accept any unilateral actions that attempted to alter the status quo and this was interpreted very quickly a such an act,\u201d he said. \u201cEngagement with China is very important to assure China its rise is welcome, but on the flip side, you have to dissuade China from taking potentially destabilising actions.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/27/china-air-defence-zone", "publicationDate": "2013-11-27T10:55:00Z", "tags": ["China", "US foreign policy", "US news", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["The zone covers islands at the heart of a long-running territorial dispute with Japan and overlaps with those already established by Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.", "&quot;At one fell swoop, Beijing&apos;s decision has injected new problems into its ties with South Korea, Taiwan and the US, further soured relations with Japan, and frightened smaller nations in south-east Asia,&quot; wrote Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, in the Asia Times.", "The zone covers the airspace over the rocky island chain claimed by Japan, China and Taiwan, which is inhabited only by goats but surrounded by fisheries and other natural resources."], "title": "China monitored US B52 bombers' flight through disputed air defence zone", "article": "The open challenge by the US to China&apos;s new air defence zone over the East China Sea was met with a muted response in Beijing, as China faced growing resistance to its attempt to extend its authority in the region. China&apos;s defence ministry said it had monitored two unarmed B-52 bombers that flew though the zone on Tuesday, and reasserted its ability to control the airspace. But its statement did not mention a previous warning that it would take &quot;defensive emergency measures&quot; if aircraft did not respond to instructions. The zone covers islands at the heart of a long-running territorial dispute with Japan and overlaps with those already established by Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Analysts say China is testing Japan&apos;s administrative control of the islands, while Beijing says it is exercising its right to self-defence. Washington and Tokyo are refusing to acknowledge the zone and US officials said the B-52s had entered it without identifying themselves, with no attempted contact from the Chinese military. The two main Japanese commercial carriers, Japan Airlines and ANA \u2013 which initially offered China flight plans \u2013 stopped doing so on Wednesday under government pressure. In Australia, the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said the government had summoned the Chinese ambassador to voice its concerns. China&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, said it had expressed strong dissatisfaction at the &quot;irresponsible&quot; remarks and urged Australia to avoid damaging bilateral relations. Air defence zones go beyond a country&apos;s national air space and require aircraft to identify themselves. Analysts have said China&apos;s rules do not distinguish between aircraft flying through the zone and those flying towards Chinese airspace. The US has said it does not apply identification procedures to foreign aircraft in its own zone unless they intend to enter US airspace. US officials said Tuesday&apos;s flight was a long-planned training mission, with the bombers carrying out a round trip from their base in Guam that took them into the zone for less than an hour. Chinese officials said they were there for two hours and 20 minutes. The state department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki ,reiterated the US government&apos;s belief that China&apos;s move was an attempt to change the status quo, which she said would &quot;raise regional tensions and increase the risk of miscalculation, confrontation and accidents&quot;. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the Chinese policy was &quot;unnecessarily inflammatory&quot; and destabilising. Some believe the creation of the zone may backfire by pushing countries in the region closer to the US. &quot;At one fell swoop, Beijing&apos;s decision has injected new problems into its ties with South Korea, Taiwan and the US, further soured relations with Japan, and frightened smaller nations in south-east Asia,&quot; wrote Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, in the Asia Times. &quot;It appears that Xi Jinping, who by all accounts has emerged stronger from the recently held Chinese Communist party third plenum, is willing to fan the flames of nationalism so he can ensure the party&apos;s popularity as he tackles economic reform at home,&quot; Glaser wrote. Analysts suggest China is initially likely to log what it describes as intrusions \u2013 as Japan does \u2013 and perhaps gradually step up efforts at enforcement. &quot;The Chinese can now start counting and reporting what they call Japanese violations, while arguing that the Chinese side has shown great restraint by not exercising what they will call China&apos;s right to shoot, and arguing further that China cannot be so patient indefinitely,&quot; Denny Roy, a security expert at the East-West Centre in Hawaii, told the Associated Press. The zone covers the airspace over the rocky island chain claimed by Japan, China and Taiwan, which is inhabited only by goats but surrounded by fisheries and other natural resources. They are known as the Senkaku or Diaoyu islands. The row over sovereignty is long-running but escalated last year when Japan bought three of the islets from a private owner, saying it was doing so to prevent nationalists from purchasing them. China&apos;s weekend announcement may also be in part a response to Japan&apos;s extension of its own zone this spring and its recent warning that it was willing to shoot down unmanned drones it regarded as a threat to its airspace. An unidentified drone was detected near the islands this autumn. The official People&apos;s Daily website quoted a military expert, Li Jie, as saying the US flights sought to test China&apos;s reaction, to discourage future interference as it continued &quot;reconnaissance, patrolling, and spying on Chinese information&quot; and because it wanted to show that it was still in charge in the Asia-Pacific region."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/27/prime-ministers-questions-michael-fabricant", "publicationDate": "2013-11-27T18:21:34Z", "tags": ["PMQs", "David Cameron", "Ed Miliband", "House of Commons", "Politics", "UK news"], "sentences": ["If you found it in your cracker, you would send the lot back to Taiwan."], "title": "Mickey Fab gives it plenty of lip  | Simon Hoggart", "article": "Prime minister&apos;s questions was, as usual, as revealing of useful information as a cuneiform tablet written on mud. Still, it had its moments. For example, we learned that David Cameron really suspects that he cannot grow a moustache. (It is his smooth skin that makes my colleague Steve Bell draw him topped with a condom.) Tory MP George Freeman asked about the Movember prostate cancer campaign. Cameron praised the &quot;magnificent growth&quot; on his upper lip, claiming that other Tories now looked like &quot;banditos&quot;. Suddenly we were in a spaghetti western, For A Few Dollars More, perhaps \u2013 theme music for the energy companies. The prime minister added, &quot;this is not something I am fully capable of myself, so I am envious&quot;. Few men would willingly admit that. And there, behind him, as if to mock this modesty, was Michael Fabricant, wearing a huge fake black moustache, looking like a cross between one of the Village People and the evildoer who ties the heiress to the railroad track. All we needed was a few cigarillos and stripy ponchos. It was more entertaining than the rest of the session. Maybe the party leaders have learned that the public really does dislike name-calling and abuse, which would be a shame. PMQs without name-calling and abuse would be like rugby without tackling; it isn&apos;t pretty, but it is the point of the game. For example, the best joke of the exchange with Ed Miliband was not just dreadful, but dreadfully dreadful. A three-year-old child would eschew it. If you found it in your cracker, you would send the lot back to Taiwan. It began when Ed Miliband asked about the coalition&apos;s plans to cap payday loan rates, when it wouldn&apos;t do the same for energy prices. How was it that the latter meant living in a Marxist universe, while the other was a solemn duty of government? The prime minister replied that he had listened carefully to the Labour leader on Desert Island Discs. &quot;He is no longer a follower of Marx, he is loving Engels instead!&quot; This was a reference, I suppose, to Angels, the song which was one of Miliband&apos;s selections. But it doesn&apos;t make a point. It&apos;s not even a proper pun. &quot;Ah, uh, ah!&quot; remarked the baffled opposition leader. He added: &quot;You&apos;d think he&apos;d spend his time trying to be prime minister.&quot; But of course Cameron didn&apos;t invent the &quot;joke&quot;. It was the work of some understrapper who is, even now, probably hanging from his thumbs in a dungeon listening to Michael Fabricant&apos;s greatest speeches on a continuous loop. Shortly afterwards Miliband accused the coalition of allowing some 31,000 old people to die last winter as a result of the cold and energy prices. Cameron responded that 36,500 had died while Miliband was energy secretary. To wave one shroud might be thought tasteless; to brandish 67,500 at once seems ghoulish."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/27/japan-china-editorial", "publicationDate": "2013-11-27T23:52:39Z", "tags": ["Senkaku Islands", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan", "China"], "sentences": ["The land to which the islands are closest is neither Japan nor China, but Taiwan \u2013 with which Tokyo has few problems.", "Last year Taiwan showed the way out of these disputes by signing an agreement with Tokyo which sidestepped the issue of sovereignty and divided the fisheries to mutual benefit."], "title": "Japan and China: collision course | Editorial", "article": "Is it Europe before the first world war or the second? Analysts disagree, but all see the escalation of military threats between the two industrial giants China and Japan over disputed islands in the East China Sea with growing alarm. The latest crisis was caused by China&apos;s decision to extend its &quot;air defence identification zone&quot; (ADIZ) over a group of uninhabited islands which Japan calls the Senkakus and China knows as the Diaoyutai. Several overflights later, not least by a pair of US B-52 bombers, and nothing much has changed, except that a hairtrigger that originally was to be measured in hours and governed by the speed of boats, has now become a matter of seconds. Few can say what prompted the latest Chinese move. This is a time when the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, is attempting to drive major economic reform and the announcement may be a sop to the military, when its voice in the national debate could be weakening. It is hard to avoid the conclusion, though, that the declaration was a way of testing the waters for a reaction \u2013 which they duly got. The state-run China Daily accused Japan and the US of overreacting, saying that if the world&apos;s sole superpower needed multiple ADIZs to fend off perceived threats, China should be allowed theirs. Besides, they claimed the measure was not targeted at any particular country. This is not how it is seen in Japan, which has witnessed a growing number of confrontations, or &quot;incidents&quot;, over islands in which Beijing showed little interest for much of the last decade. For Japan, the dispute over the islands is part of a major naval push to extend China&apos;s maritime influence beyond the first island chain of the Pacific. China claims the status quo was changed by Japan&apos;s decision to nationalise the islands. What they don&apos;t want to admit is that this was done to stop the islands being used by Japanese nationalists on madcap flag waving stunts. The land to which the islands are closest is neither Japan nor China, but Taiwan \u2013 with which Tokyo has few problems. Last year Taiwan showed the way out of these disputes by signing an agreement with Tokyo which sidestepped the issue of sovereignty and divided the fisheries to mutual benefit. This model, first applied in the North Sea, is the only rational way out of these disputes \u2013 although it is not one that Britain is particularly keen on applying to the Falklands. China and Japan agreed in 2008 to co-operate on the joint development of the East China Sea. Further talks have never been pursued and, to date, not even a hotline exists between the two powers to avert another incident in the sea or in the air. It is time for people in China and Japan to turn down the volume of simplistic nationalist rhetoric and to pursue pragmatic dialogue."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/nov/28/rabies-researchers-road-to-eliminating-disease", "publicationDate": "2013-11-28T13:04:14Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Vaccines and immunisation", "Pharmaceuticals industry", "Infectious diseases", "Animals", "Health & wellbeing", "Medical research", "Science", "World news"], "sentences": ["Countries such as Taiwan, which had been free from the disease for decades, and even France, which recently issued a rabies warning."], "title": "Rabies researchers hit highs and lows on road to eliminating disease | Charles Rupprecht", "article": "For those of us involved in the global battle to eliminate rabies, these past few years have been tumultuous. There have been high points. In 2004, a Wisconsin schoolgirl, Jeanna Giese, became the first unvaccinated person to defeat the potentially life-threatening disease, giving real hope that the course of action to save her, known as the Milwaukee protocol, could lead to a lasting treatment. There has been success in the developing world, too, where the disease is most prevalent. By working with government, educationalists and local communities, we have developed strategies for eliminating rabies at a local level for very little upfront investment. But there have also been setbacks. The Milwaukee protocol (pdf), which involves putting the patient into a chemically induced coma to allow the body&apos;s immune system to gain strength, has had only sporadic success since our breakthrough with Jeanna. Despite the efforts of health professionals in the developing world, including those in my own organisation, the Global Alliance for Rabies Control, this clever, irrepressible killer continues to claim tens of thousands of lives every year. Partly through complacency (many governments assume that once the disease has been brought under control, they can ignore it), lack of awareness and inadequate infrastructure, areas once considered rabies-free are again falling under its shadow. Countries such as Taiwan, which had been free from the disease for decades, and even France, which recently issued a rabies warning. Yet there has never been a more optimistic time to be a rabies researcher. Those of us on the frontline can see a confluence of advances emerging that together may bring hope to the tens of millions of people affected by the disease each year. One of our biggest problems is that because rabies tends to hit hardest in remote locations, it takes too long to learn of disease outbreaks. So we&apos;ve been working hard with governments, universities, and other organisations to roll out enhanced surveillance, relevant diagnostic testing and improved infrastructure to address this. The most cost-effective solution for controlling rabies is mass dog vaccination in at-risk communities. Not an easy task, given the huge numbers of stray dogs in many parts of the world. But advances in non-surgical contraceptives make it easier to manage canine populations without resorting to culling. In the US, we&apos;ve been working with the US department of agriculture, the Navajo nation, and the Mexican ministry of health on a combined, single-shot contraceptive and rabies vaccine that will bring further improvements in cost, efficacy and welfare. And progress is being made in controlling the disease in other wild animals. Oral vaccines distributed in baits have helped control rabies in foxes, raccoons and coyotes. Ideas flourish as to how we can extend the treatment to mongooses, ferret badgers, marmosets and bats. Too many people die because they either do not know about effective rabies treatment or cannot access it. In some cases, bite victims receive up to 21 shots over three to four weeks. When the nearest clinic is miles away, and treatment costs as much as it does, it is tragic but unsurprising that many people are not able to complete their course. Through more targeted drug delivery, we have reduced vaccination to two to three weeks and aim to cut it further, to just one week. For the first time everything is aligned to prevent, control and eliminate rabies. There is a huge commitment at a global level and, most importantly, in local communities. Together we can defeat this killer.

The ministry of defence announced the move, which is the first time China is known to have sent military aircraft into the zone alongside foreign flights, stepping up its response to the challenge after its unilateral establishment of the zone.  It previously said it had monitored US, Japanese and South Korean aircraft and had flown routine patrols in the area on Thursday. The ministry&apos;s statement said two US reconnaissance aircraft and 10 Japanese early warning, reconnaissance and fighter planes had entered the zone. The airforce &quot;monitored throughout the entire flights, made timely identification and ascertained the types&quot;, defence ministry spokesman Shen Jinke told the official China News Service. The Pentagon has yet to respond to the statement. Japanese officials declined to confirm details of any flights, saying that routine missions were continuing. Late on Friday the US state department advised American commercial airlines to notify Chinese authorities of flight plans over the East China Sea. But a US administration official said that did not mean Washington accepted Beijing&apos;s jurisdiction, the Reuters news agency reported. &quot;The US government generally expects that US carriers operating internationally will operate consistent with Notams [Notices to Airmen] issued by foreign countries,&quot; the state department said in a statement. &quot;Our expectation of operations by US carriers consistent with Notams does not indicate US government acceptance of China&apos;s requirements.&quot; The developments came as South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency said officials were discussing how to expand its own air zone. In Taiwan, legislators issued an unusual joint statement chiding Ma Ying-jeou&apos;s government for its tempered response to China&apos;s announcement of the zone and urging it to lodge a tough protest with Beijing. The government later said it would convey its &quot;stern position&quot;. Earlier the European Union&apos;s foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton expressed its concern that the zone had contributed to tensions in the region, saying that the EU called on all sides to exercise caution and restraint. Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang urged the EU to handle the situation &quot;objectively and rationally&quot;, adding: &quot;European countries can have air defence identification zones. Why can&apos;t China?&quot; While such zones are common, China&apos;s is controversial because it includes the skies over islands known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, which are the subject of a long-running territorial dispute, and overlaps zones established by Japan and South Korea. There has also been concern over China&apos;s warning that it would take unspecified &quot;emergency defensive measures&quot; if aircraft did not comply. Taylor Fravel, an expert on regional security at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said establishment of the zone increased the potential for an incident in the air that could spark a larger crisis. But he said tensions might ease if China continued to clarify the nature of the zone and how it intended to deal with unidentified aircraft, especially those flying through the zone but not heading toward China. &quot;China has always chafed at Japan&apos;s adiz [air defence identification zone], which at some points is less than 150km from China \u2026 China probably wants to level the playing field with Japan and increase the pressure on Tokyo regarding the disputed islands,&quot; he said. Japan does not acknowledge that ownership of the islands is disputed. The US does not have a position on their sovereignty but recognises Japan&apos;s administrative control and has said they are covered by the joint security pact. Many analysts think China is laying down a long-term marker, but did not anticipate the forceful response it has received from the US as well as Japan. &quot;The Chinese government is not going to concede the substance,&quot; said June Teufel Dreyer of the University of Miami. &quot;When circumstances are more conducive, they will try to enforce it more strictly in the future. This is a pattern we have noticed for decades.&quot; Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, Asia-Pacific director at the US Institute of Peace, said the creation of its zone had its own momentum. &quot;The danger in the announcement is that it empowers the People&apos;s Liberation Army, maritime agencies and netizens [internet users] to hold the government to account,&quot; she said. &quot;Now people are transgressing the zone, they have to make it look to the domestic audience like they are serious. They have given birth to internal pressures.&quot; Behind the immediate issues lie regional concerns about China&apos;s growing strength, Beijing&apos;s unease at Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe&apos;s determination to strengthen his country&apos;s forces, and questions about the US presence in and commitment to the region. US vice-president Joe Biden will visit Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul on a trip beginning this Sunday which is likely to be dominated by discussions of the zone. &quot;I think the only problem is Japan because it has taken a confrontational policy. They want clashes and to drag America into military containment against China,&quot; said Yan Xuetong, a foreign relations scholar at Tsinghua University. &quot;The international community has ignored the roots of this \u2026 Abe has clearly stated that his fundamental goal is to revise the constitution [under which Japan renounces war] and he needs security tensions to legitimise his efforts.&quot; Tokyo&apos;s military ambitions are particularly sensitive because many in China say Japan has not adequately recognised or atoned for its brutal occupation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/dec/03/the-joy-of-six-australia-v-new-zealand", "publicationDate": "2013-12-02T20:50:17Z", "tags": ["Netball", "Australia cricket team", "New Zealand cricket team", "Australia rugby union team", "New Zealand rugby union team", "Australia rugby league", "New Zealand rugby league", "Australia", "New Zealand", "Football", "Cricket", "Rugby union", "Rugby league", "Basketball", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "sentences": ["In large part, that\u2019s because Australia\u2019s Oceania qualifying group \u2014one that included New Zealand, Indonesia, Fiji and Taiwan\u2014 looked invitingly easy."], "title": "The Joy of Six: Australia v New Zealand", "article": "1. The underhanded underarm The Melbourne Cricket Ground echoes with history but few sporting moments have resonated quite like the events of Sunday, February 1, 1981. During the third final (of five) of the World Series Cup one-day international between Australia and New Zealand \u2014a final witnessed by a then world-record crowd of 52,990\u2014 an act of underhandedness caused uproar and outrage on both sides of the Tasman. With New Zealand needing a six to tie an incident-packed match, and with wicketkeeper Rod Marsh shaking his head and saying \u201cdon\u2019t do it\u201d, bowler Trevor Chappell, as instructed by his captain, and big brother, Greg, rolled the ball down the pitch to the on-strike batsman Brian McKechnie. As boos rang out around the MCG, McKechnie blocked the delivery and threw his bat away in disgust. \u201cThis is possibly a little bit disappointing,\u201d said commentator Bill Lawry in his only recorded example of understatement, as New Zealand captain, Geoff Howarth, ran onto the field to question the legitimacy of the delivery. The rules were promptly changed but at the time the delivery was legitimate. Clearly, however, it was against the spirit of the game and accordingly it created a scandal. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister Robert Muldoon called it \u201can act of true cowardice and I consider it appropriate that the Australian team were wearing yellow\u201d\u00a0while his Australian counterpart, Malcolm Fraser, described it as a \u201cvery serious mistake\u201d and called on Greg Chappell to apologise. Others called on Chappell to be stood down as captain while at least one state cricketing body appealed for the result to be annulled and the match replayed. The result stood, however, and despite a reprimand Chappell\u2019s captaincy endured. But so did the shame he felt for his mad decision, something he later called \u201ca cry for help\u201d in light of feeling diminished by the pressure of the job and a grueling schedule. Two days after the underarm ball, days in which he hid from the media, Chappell issued a statement saying: \u201cI regret the decision.\u201d He added, unnecessarily you\u2019d think: \u201cIt is something I would not do again.\u201d Showing an optimistic streak, Howarth then tried to defuse the situation with what must rank as one of the most notable examples of forlorn hope in history: \u201cI hope that by tomorrow the whole thing will be forgotten.\u201d Yet within the outrage, disgust, and apoplexy, you wonder if, in hindsight, the incident had its benefits for those across the ditch. Suddenly New Zealanders everywhere knew that from that moment on they would have a trump card they could play whenever they found themselves backed into a corner in a meaningless debate about the relative merits of each country \u2014debates which can sadly include fighting over crumbs from the table, like who can claim ownership of the meringue-based dessert pavlova. And Russell Crowe. \u201cThat\u2019s all well and good,\u201d a New Zealander is now able to say, \u201cbut, well, how should I put this\u2026 Trevor Chappell.\u201d Discussion over.            2. Nobody\u2019s perfect The 2000 Bledisloe Cup series featured two of the most thrilling rugby matches in recent memory. And given the Wallabies\u2019 fall from grace since those heady days it\u2019s the second game of the two-match series that occupies a special place in Australian hearts. In short, it\u2019s become the happy place today\u2019s Wallabies fans mentally escape to when faced with yet another stomping by the All Blacks. Before we get to that second game in Wellington, however, a word on the first in Sydney. It\u2019s not the kind of game one should gloss over. Held at Sydney\u2019s Stadium Australia two months before the Olympic Games, 109,874 fans witnessed a remarkable contest that in Antipodean rugby circles is colloquially known as the \u201cgreatest game ever played\u201d. Not that it looked like having a chance of earning that kind of hyperbolic title early on. Inside eight minutes, the All Blacks stormed to a 24-0 lead during which time Australia didn\u2019t touch the ball. But in a remarkable turnaround, the Wallabies, inspired by the leadership of John Eales and the genius of Stephen Larkham, a man who, as if boneless, could ghost his way through the most compressed of defensive lines, scored 27 unanswered points. The All Blacks would later retake the lead but when Australia scored out wide with only a few minutes left to make the score 35-34 the incredible game appeared to have been won. But there was time for one final twist, and in the 84th\u00a0minute Jonah Lomu brushed through a Larkham tackle on the left touchline to score and steal a memorable 39-34 victory for the All Blacks.            Three weeks later, in Wellington, the Wallabies needed a win to tie the series 1-1 and retain the Bledisloe Cup. But on a wet, blustery day, Australia always looked a touch off the pace, like a commuter chasing a bus down a busy high street. And when the full-time siren sounded Australia, trailing 23-21, had the ball on their own quarter and the All Blacks a hand on the Bledisloe Cup. But following a wobbly Larkham punt and a lineout steal, Australia were awarded a controversial penalty in the 85th\u00a0minute, 10m in from the left hand touchline. But the Wallabies\u2019 main kicker Sterling Mortlock was off the field. Who\u2019d take the kick? Up stepped Australia\u2019s rangy captain and lock Eales, nicknamed \u201cNobody\u201d because, well, nobody\u2019s perfect. Blocking out the noise inside his head and around the ground, Eales was the picture of composure as he placed the ball, measured out his run up and slotted it unerringly between the posts to seal a 24-23 Wallabies win. Eales then turned to his team-mates and raised his arms. The photographers had their iconic shot and the All Blacks fans an image that would haunt them for a long time to come.            3. The Kiwis end the Kangaroos\u2019 reign of terror Leading up to the 2005 Tri-Nations series Australia was rugby league\u2019s cruel overlord, one who for 27 years had kept all opposition (headed by Great Britain/England, New Zealand and France) under the heel of their boot. Not since Les Chanticleers stunned the Kangaroos in 1978 had Australia lost a series, and while they were tested a number of times after that (notably by Great Britain/England in 1990, 1992 and 1995) it was as if these close calls were signs not of their mortality but rather reminders of their invincibility. Australia always won the games that counted. It was this knowledge that gave Australian fans faith ahead of the 2005 Tri-Nations final against New Zealand, a game held at Leeds\u2019 Elland Road on Saturday, November 26, 2005. New Zealand had upset Australia 38-28 in the tournament opener in Sydney on October 15, and the Kiwis nearly did it again before losing 28-26 in Auckland just a week later. But a final was another matter altogether. And while the Wayne Bennett-coached Australia were missing Darren Lockyer, Andrew Johns and Shane Webcke, New Zealand had to do without stars of their own in Benji Marshall and Sonny Bill Williams. Given Australia\u2019s depth of talent, however, few gave New Zealand a chance. But in one of the biggest upsets in league history \u2014one that led to Bennett\u2019s resignation\u2014 New Zealand ran in four tries as they thrashed Australia 24-0.            Led by half Stacey Jones, the redoubtable Reuben Wiki and teenage colossus and two-try hero Manu Vatuvei, the Kiwis not only ended Australia\u2019s long and painful reign, but improved New Zealand-Great Britain relations as English officials celebrated with the Kiwis at the Leeds Marriott into the small hours of Sunday morning. The kava flowed and the old adage was proven: the enemy of my enemy is my friend. 4. All Whites kick the Socceroos where it hurts Amid their litany of heartbreaking World Cup qualifying losses the Socceroos\u2019 defeat at the hands of New Zealand\u2019s All Whites ahead of the 1982 World Cup in Spain is often overlooked. Perhaps that\u2019s because it didn\u2019t occur in a last-ditch play-off \u2014as with the Socceroos\u2019 loss to Iran at the MCG in 1997\u2014 but as far as humiliations go, Australia\u2019s loss to the Kiwis in 1981 takes some beating. In large part, that\u2019s because Australia\u2019s Oceania qualifying group \u2014one that included New Zealand, Indonesia, Fiji and Taiwan\u2014 looked invitingly easy. In the lead-up to the first of Australia\u2019s two matches against New Zealand, who were considered the main hurdle preventing Australia progressing to a round two qualifying group, the Socceroos played Australia\u2019s youth team in a warm-up at Barton Park in Sydney\u2019s Rockdale. While the Rudi Gutendorf-coached Socceroos won 3-0 they didn\u2019t exactly do it in style and Don Jones, a New Zealand national league coach in the stands to gather intelligence for the Kiwis, was blunt in his assessment of the Socceroos. \u201cThey are hopeless up front,\u201d he told the Australian media, refreshingly avoiding any of the forced diplomacy you see today. \u201cBefore I came tonight I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d have a chance of beating Australia but after seeing this I think we have.\u201d Six weeks later, the Australians arrived in Auckland for the first of their double header. To shake off any stiffness from the short flight Gutendorf decided his players should have a light run and was directed to a nearby ground. In what you might read as an omen, it turned out to be a cow manure-covered paddock. Five days later, on Anzac Day, at Mt Smart Stadium, the Socceroos were lucky to escape with a 3-3 draw. \u201cTake out [Eddie] Krncevic\u2019s superb first goal, and some clever work by [Alan] Davidson,\u201d wrote the Sydney Morning Herald, \u201cand you are left with a collection of miskicks, clumsy ball work, inept defence and a paucity of imagination in attack. In short, a shambles.\u201d            After the drawn game, and despite all the other home and away fixtures still on the horizon, Australia\u2019s World Cup dream appeared to be riding on the return clash at the SCG and the pressure was building on the team and coach. As a desperate measure Gutendorf included in his 22-man-squad 33-year-old Peter Wilson who led the Socceroos to their only World Cup finals appearance in 1974 but hadn\u2019t played international football for two years. But Wilson withdrew from the squad (before retiring at the end of the year and becoming the JD Salinger of Australian sport). It was a smart choice. On Saturday, May 16, New Zealand defeated the Socceroos 2-0 prompting headlines like: \u201cAustralian soccer died an inglorious death at the Sydney Cricket Ground\u201d and \u201cHeads must roll!\u201d And roll they did, beginning with the head of Gutendorf who had promised to lead Australia to the promised land but instead steered them back to the wilderness.            The defeat of Australia helped New Zealand top the group. They then finished behind Kuwait in a second qualifying group to secure their passage to their first ever World Cup finals. Australia watched from home thinking what could have been. 5. The Diamonds make a point The tightest contest in Trans-Tasman sport is arguably between the netball teams of Australia and New Zealand. Between them, the Diamonds and Silver Ferns have won all 14 world championships since 1963 (this includes 1979 when the two nations, as well as Trinidad and Tobago, shared the title). Since 1938, when they played the first ever international game of netball (or \u201cwomen\u2019s basketball\u201d as many knew it then), Australia and New Zealand have contested a further 115 netball tests with Australia leading the head-to-head 69-45 \u2014numbers that seem to give Australia a comfortable edge. But they don\u2019t tell the full story since the winning margins are usually tighter than a duck\u2019s wetsuit. As so it proved when Australia faced New Zealand in the final of the 1991 World Championships at a packed Sydney Entertainment Centre. Played the day after the semi-finals, the match, broadcast live on television, bubbled with atmosphere, and it maintained an unrelenting intensity both on court and in the stands where the noise had the pitch and fervor of a Beatles crowd. At no point did either team look like establishing a decisive lead, although the Silver Ferns, captained by Waimarama Taumauna, went into each break with a single goal lead. As befitting the history between the two teams, the last minutes of the match were frenetic. It was Australia, captained by Michelle Fielke, who got their noses in front with minutes to go when the eternally cool goal-shooter Vicki Wilson \u2014who even seemed unruffled by the baggy gold polo tops and pleated skirts that have since been resigned to the op shop of history\u2014 sunk a pressure goal to give Australia a 52-51 lead. A two-goal buffer was then established after Catriona Wagg converted another chance. But New Zealand, scrapping for their lives, reduced the lead to a single goal before Taumauna intercepted an Australian pass. Just as New Zealand broke downfield to set up a possible equaliser Rosalee Jencke stole the ball back and Australia maintained possession for the remaining seconds to send the crowd into raptures.            6. Boomers flattened by Tall Blacks Ahead of the 2001 Oceania basketball final between Australia\u2019s Boomers and New Zealand\u2019s Tall Blacks the New Zealand betting agencies had their team at 15/1 to win the opening game. The Tall Blacks\u2019 odds of winning the three-game series, and by doing so qualifying for the 2002 World Championships in Indianapolis, were even longer. And why not? Prior to the series, New Zealand had beaten Australia just once in 35 games, with that lone win coming 23 years earlier. But New Zealand got off to a flyer in Wellington on the Friday night winning 85-78 and it was immediately apparent that the Boomers \u2014without the likes of Andrew Gaze, Shane Heal, Mark Bradtke (all retired), Jason Smith and Sam Mackinnon (both injured)\u2014 were not the force they once were, despite the class of Darryl McDonald and Brett Maher. The Australians at least rallied the next night in Hamilton though it took overtime and a rimmed-out shot from New Zealand to secure the 81-79 win. This meant that everything would be on the line in Auckland on the Sunday. After the Tall Blacks\u2019 traditional haka the Australians began well and despite a hail Mary three-pointer from\u00a0Paul Henare on the buzzer, the Boomers went into the first quarter break leading 29-21. The Boomers\u2019 lead was reduced to six at half-time but from that point New Zealand, led by Phill Jones and Pero Cameron, wore the Australians down and forced them into error. Down the stretch the Tall Blacks all but waltzed past Australia and ended up winning comfortably, 89-78. \u201cThe unheard of has happened,\u201d wrote the Melbourne Age, which forecast financial and emotional repercussions. Gaze, meantime, said Australian basketball had suddenly lost its international credibility. Under-fire Boomers\u2019 coach Phil Smyth said such talk disrespected New Zealand talent, but a week later, after being led to the edge of the precipice by Basketball Australia, Smyth jumped, his resignation coming just eight months into his four-year term, a term that no doubt was supposed to take in the World Championships. To make their win sweeter, New Zealand performed exceptionally well in Indianapolis. By winning three of six qualifying games (against Russia, Venezuela and China), they qualified for the quarter-finals where they beat Puerto Rico 65-63. They finally fell in the semi-finals, comfortably beaten by Yugoslavia, but by finishing fourth in the tournament New Zealand basketball had reached its highest point.\u00a0"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/us-china-rescind-air-defence-zone-confrontation-japan", "publicationDate": "2013-12-03T06:43:49Z", "tags": ["Obama administration", "US news", "China", "Japan", "World news", "Senkaku Islands", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["When asked to comment about concerns that China might set up a similar zone over the South China Sea \u2013\u00a0where it has disputes with the Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam \u2013 Ma Keqing said it was the Chinese government&apos;s right to decide &quot;where and when to set up the new air identification zone&quot;."], "title": "US calls on China to rescind air defence zone to avoid Japan confrontation", "article": "The US called on China to scrap its newly declared air defence identification zone on Monday, warning that Beijing risked a potentially dangerous confrontation with Japan and its allies at the start of a trip to the region by vice-president Joe Biden. The explicit request for China to \u201crescind\u201d threats against unannounced aircraft passing over a chain of islands in the East China sea was made by the US just hours after Biden landed in Tokyo ahead of a six-day trip to Japan, China and South Korea. \u201cThe fact that China\u2019s announcement has caused confusion and increased the risk of accidents only further underscores the validity of concerns and the need for China to rescind the procedures,\u201d said Jen Psaki, the chief spokesperson for the State Department. Biden, who was met at Tokyo airport by Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of former president John F Kennedy and recently appointed ambassador to Japan, is expected to attempt to defuse the controversy during his visit. Senior diplomats privately concede that the dispute over the airspace above the islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, will almost entirely dominate Biden\u2019s trip, which had been intended to focus on US economic interests in the region. The row began nine days ago when Beijing unilaterally declared the enlarged air defence identification zone. The Chinese defence ministry ordered all aircraft flying through the zone to notify Chinese authorities in advance, warning that it would &quot;identify, monitor, control and react to&quot; any air threats or unidentified flying objects coming from the sea. \u201cThat kind of coercive, strong language is worrisome, and we hope it is not tested,\u201d a senior government official from the region told the Guardian, echoing growing concern about the possible risk of an accidental confrontation that spirals out of control. The official said one possible scenario would see military aircraft scrambled simultaneously by China and the US, and possibly Japan too, meeting in the air. Another would be that China feels the need to intercept an aircraft that enters the contested airspace without prior notice. \u201cMishaps and miscalculations can happen, particularly if aircraft are scrambled to intercept an aircraft. You never know how these situations can unfold.\u201d Japanese airlines passing through the military zone declared by China are not currently informing Beijing of their flight plans. However, aircraft associated with other countries, including those flown by US and South Korean airlines, are submitting information to the Chinese, after domestic civil aviation authorities advised it was in the interest of safety. Psaki stressed that the guidance to airlines from the Federal Aviation Authority \u201cin no way indicates\u201d US acceptance of China\u2019s declaration. She said China had made the declaration \u201cin an uncoordinated fashion\u201d which was \u201cinconsistent with standard practice\u201d, adding the US did not believe the declaration to be legitimate. Her remarks were echoed by the White House. &quot;This is about the safety and security of passengers and is not, in any way, indication of a change in our position,\u201d said spokesman Jay Carney. \u201cThis appears to be a provocative attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the the East China sea and thus raises tensions and increases the risk of inadvertent confrontation.\u201d On Tuesday the Chinese envoy to the Philippines added to tensions, saying Beijing had a sovereign right to establish a maritime air defence zone over other regions. When asked to comment about concerns that China might set up a similar zone over the South China Sea \u2013\u00a0where it has disputes with the Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam \u2013 Ma Keqing said it was the Chinese government&apos;s right to decide &quot;where and when to set up the new air identification zone&quot;.\u00a0Ma said the East China Sea zone&apos;s designation &quot;will not hinder any normal freedom of flights within this area if they&apos;ve notified the Chinese authorities&quot;. The US ambassador to Manila, Philip Goldberg, described China&apos;s move as dangerous. &quot;We do not believe that this is a move intended to build confidence or in any other way improve the situation,&quot; he said. Instead, China&apos;s new zone &quot;will create tension and the possibility of miscalculations and that&apos;s never good&quot;. Biden, who arrived in Japan late on Monday night, is now tasked with delicate role of attempting to cool tensions. \u201cI believe this latest incident underscores the need for agreement between China and Japan to establish crisis management and confidence-building measures to lower tensions,\u201d the vice-president said in an interview with Japan\u2019s Asahi Shimbun newspaper on the eve of his arrival. Washington has not taken a formal position on the sovereignty of the islands. However, it recognises Tokyo&apos;s administrative control, and said explicitly last week that its treaty to defend Japan militarily applies to territory around the islands. The US, in its most direct challenge to Chinese military endeavours in two decades, flew two B-52 bombers through the zone without notifying the Chinese. The US navy has sent P-8 Poseidon patrol aircraft to Japan, a long-planned move that gives the allies greater ability to track hostile submarines and other naval ships in Japanese waters. Following Washington\u2019s lead, Tokyo has sent military aircraft, including F-15 fighter jets and Awacs surveillance planes, directly through the claimed Chinese zone. For Japan, which has recently reopened debate on its formal post-second world war pacifist defence policies, it has been a notably aggressive response. However the decision by US aviation authorities to advise airlines to comply with China\u2019s requests has roiled Japan, despite Washington\u2019s repeated insistence last week that its commitment to Japanese security is beyond question. The Japanese TV station NHK quoted a former senior foreign ministry official, Yukia Okimoto, saying the US \u201churt Japan\u2019s interests over an issue related directly to Japan\u2019s national security in a way visible to the whole world\u201d. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, said he would \u201cdeal with the matter by co-ordinating closely\u201d with Biden, who will visit Beijing on Wednesday and meet with China\u2019s president Xi Jinping. The vice-president is known to have a particularly good relationship with Xi, formed over several years. Biden\u2019s trip enables him to have face-to-face contact with all the regional players with a stake in the controversy, including South Korea, where he will spend two days meeting senior government officials at the end of the week. South Korea, which has strained relations with Japan, is also being sucked into the dispute. Local reports indicate that Seoul is in the final stages of expanding its own six-decade-old air defense identification zone southward, which would overlap with territory claimed by China. The move comes after a defense consultation last week between China and South Korea failed to reassure Seoul that China\u2019s expanded zone was aimed exclusively at Japan. The senior government official said one unintended consequence of China\u2019s declaration could be that Japan and South Korea, rivals undergoing a particularly strained relations at the moment, will be brought closer together. The official said the two countries were expected to \u201ccompare notes\u201d over how to respond to China\u2019s move \u2013 and high-level meetings between the two countries remain a possibility. It is unclear if Biden will attempt to mediate between China, Japan and South Korea. Aides to the vice-president told reporters last week that Biden would seek only \u201cclarity\u201d from China about its military intentions, but declined to say that he would call for China to reverse its declaration, which Japan is seeking. China has thus far shown no signs of retreating over the zone. It announced that it scrambled its own fighter jets in the air defence identification zone on Friday, an intended challenge to the US and Japan. But the Japanese defense ministry sharply questioned whether the Chinese jets ever actually passed through the zone, issuing a statement saying it spotted no additional air traffic in the area.

Add to that the uncertain steps of the US, divided between its formal security obligations to Japan and its powerful economic ties to China, and the risks of an accidental conflict becomes uncomfortably real. China and Japan have been prickly neighbours for centuries. China traditionally viewed Japan as one of its smaller, weaker, tributary neighbours; political satellites to China&apos;s sun. So when China&apos;s Qing dynasty declined in the 19th century and Japan transformed itself into a successful modern nation that held up a mirror to China&apos;s failures, China&apos;s reformers and revolutionaries flocked to Japan to try to learn its lessons. If Japan could become a strong power, they asked, why was China weak? This question dominated the unhappy history that followed. In 1895, Japan occupied Taiwan, intending to turn it into a model colony, the first step to the domination of Asia. In the 20th century, Japan invaded Manchuria, and finally China itself, in a brutal eight-year war of occupation, that ended only with Japan&apos;s defeat by the allied powers in 1945. Nowhere is Japan&apos;s aggression remembered more clearly than in China. Chinese history, as the Communist party has constructed it since 1989, blames all of China&apos;s ills on external aggression \u2013 a humiliation that China&apos;s Communist party has pledged to expunge. Western powers have minor roles in this narrative, but Japan is the star of the story. Each 18 September, on the anniversary of the Japanese bombing of a Japanese railway in Mukden that became the pretext for the occupation of Manchuria in 1931, China revives that legacy in National Humiliation Day, an exercise in ritual victimhood designed to shore up its own political credentials. History was not always told this way: from the Communist victory in 1949 until the death of Mao Zedong, the Communist party&apos;s main political target was the Kuomintang, Taiwan&apos;s ruling party and Mao&apos;s rivals for historical legitimacy. In the past China routinely published maps that showed the disputed islands as Japanese and referred to them as the Senkaku. But after the trauma of Tiananmen Square in 1989, China&apos;s rulers needed nationalism to justify their continuing rule, and began to memorialise Japan&apos;s atrocities in new sites across the country. In April this year, China&apos;s foreign ministry escalated its claim by describing the Diaoyu islands as a &quot;core&quot; national interest, on a par with Tibet or Taiwan. Indignation and resentment have their political uses. China, like many of its neighbours, believes that Japan has shown insufficient remorse for its past aggression. Japan&apos;s victors in 1945 left the Japanese emperor on his throne and the country relatively unpurged of past attitudes and ideology. But while others have made their peace in the interests of the future, China has installed Japan&apos;s crimes as a central narrative of its modern identity. The symbolic value of the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands is now embedded in an unpredictable contest of national pride. In such games, small escalations have disproportionate effects. Japan argues that ownership of the islands is not in dispute and has a powerful historical and legal case. For Japan, too, they have become a touchstone of national pride and both governments are held prisoner by a popular sentiment they have done much to create. So when China declared its East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), it was no surprise that it was read as an escalation of its claim to sovereignty that obliged both Japan and the US to respond. Many countries, beginning with the United States, have declared large ADIZs that require planes crossing the zone to file flight plans and report to air traffic control. China can plausibly argue these precedents as justification, but, as Beijing well knows, to declare an ADIZ in a situation of tension, with no prior consultation, and to apply the rules to all traffic regardless of its destination, elevates it far beyond the routine. Few doubt that China intends this as an enforcement of its claim; an ill-advised move with potential consequences that nobody can foresee."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/dec/03/uk-students-education-oecd-pisa-report", "publicationDate": "2013-12-03T10:00:00Z", "tags": ["Schools", "OECD", "Education", "Primary schools", "Tristram Hunt", "Secondary schools", "Politics", "Global economy", "Business", "World news"], "sentences": ["OECD_LITERACY_CHART_0212.png    But Tristram Hunt, Labour shadow education secretary, seized on the improved performance by Britain&apos;s Asian economic rivals \u2013 including China&apos;s Shanghai region, Taiwan and South Korea \u2013 to accuse David Cameron of failing to confront the international challenge."], "title": "UK students stuck in educational doldrums, OECD study finds", "article": "A stubborn gap in attainment between Britain&apos;s best- and worst-performing students has pinned the UK to the middle of international education rankings, despite years of effort by successive governments to raise standards. The latest edition of the programme for international student achievement (Pisa) from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), published today, shows the UK&apos;s position virtually unchanged from the last exercise in 2009, with slight improvements in the reading and maths scores of the nation&apos;s 15 year-olds offset by a minor drop in science.     OECD_RANKING_CHART_0312.png    The UK slipped back four places in science, to rank 20th out of 65 countries and regions taking part in exams administered by the OECD; in maths and reading the UK gained two places to reach 26th and 23rd overall, with results comparable to France&apos;s. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD&apos;s deputy director for education and skills and co-ordinator of the Pisa programme, said anyone looking for the impact of the education reforms introduced in England since the 2010 election was &quot;three years early&quot;. &quot;You are not going to see great surprises about the UK in this data,&quot; Schleicher said, announcing the results at a briefing in London.     OECD_LITERACY_CHART_0212.png    But Tristram Hunt, Labour shadow education secretary, seized on the improved performance by Britain&apos;s Asian economic rivals \u2013 including China&apos;s Shanghai region, Taiwan and South Korea \u2013 to accuse David Cameron of failing to confront the international challenge. &quot;The Pisa report is a big wake-up call,&quot; Hunt said. &quot;Eastern dominance centres on the importance that these high-performing education systems place on the quality and status of the teaching profession as the central lever for driving up standards.&quot; &quot;This report exposes the failings of this government&apos;s schools policy \u2013 a policy that has sent unqualified teachers into the classroom and prevented effective collaboration between schools.&quot; In maths, the UK&apos;s 26th place was similar to the positions of France, Ireland and New Zealand, as well as an an advance on its 2009 ranking of 28th. In reading, UK students 23rd position overall was comparable to those of France, Germany and the US. Professor Robert Coe, of Durham University, said: &quot;It is interesting that Pisa test results for the UK show little difference in maths, English and science for recent years. This seems to underline the view that improvements in GCSEs and some other examinations have had more to do with grade inflation than real, sustained improvement over time.&quot; The picture was slightly different when the UK&apos;s home nations were listed individually. While 15 year-olds in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland all showed almost identical performances to their previous scores, Wales lagged further behind in all three subject areas. The OECD&apos;s analysis showed that the UK had relatively good results in terms of the attainment of immigrants, and a smaller gender gap than many other countries. However, its high proportion of low-acheiving students, and their performance compared with those of their counterparts in other countries, held it back from appearing higher in the rankings. Sir Peter Lampl, chair of the Sutton Trust, which seeks to promote the interests of non-privileged students, said improving the performance of teachers in England&apos;s schools was the key. &quot;We need a relentless focus on improving the quality of existing teachers within the classroom, through better appraisal, professional development and leadership,&quot; Lampl said. &quot;Sutton Trust research has shown that English schools could improve their low position in international league tables in reading and mathematics and become one of the top five education performers in the world within 10 years, if the performance of the country&apos;s least effective teachers were brought up to the national average.&quot; Christine Blower of the National Union of Teachers said any debate over the Pisa rankings should take into account different economic and social situations. &quot;It is regrettable but a plain fact that child poverty is the biggest factor limiting children&apos;s potential. Life outside of the classroom does impact on the ability to learn and is an issue that this and future governments must address,&quot; Blower said. The OECD analysis said that, while the UK spends more on education than most OECD member states, that expenditure did not translate into improved education. Schleicher said there was little difference between the UK&apos;s state and independent schools in terms of their quality of education, according to Pisa&apos;s findings. &quot;Our data doesn&apos;t show much of a performance difference between public and private schools, once you account for socio-economic background,&quot; he said. &quot;Much of the advantage that comes from private schooling is confirmed by the social-economic context, not necessarily in value added.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/03/east-asian-top-oecd-education-rankings", "publicationDate": "2013-12-03T10:03:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "South Korea", "Education", "Hong Kong", "Singapore", "OECD", "Global economy", "Business", "UK news", "Taiwan", "Science", "Mathematics"], "sentences": ["Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea made up the rest of the top five for maths, followed by the Chinese island of Macao.", "Finland was the highest placed European country, with a top-five performance in science, while Ireland was sixth-equal with Taiwan in reading."], "title": "East Asian countries top global league tables for educational performance", "article": "Asia&apos;s rising economic success has helped China&apos;s hi-tech corridor to take a clear lead in the latest OECD international education rankings.

Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea made up the rest of the top five for maths, followed by the Chinese island of Macao. Elsewhere, Pisa results were a further disappointment for the US, which saw its maths rank fall to 36th place overall, worse than its 2009 performance, which President Obama dubbed a &quot;Sputnik moment&quot; for American education. In reading, the US fell seven places, to 24th, and in science the country came in 28th, down five. Australia saw a precipitous fall in its maths ranking, from 15th in 2009 to 19th in 2012, as it was overtaken by Poland and the new entrant, Vietnam, which appears in the OECD tables for the first time. Australia&apos;s reading score was little changed but its performance in science slipped from 10th to 16th, tied with Macao. Finland was the highest placed European country, with a top-five performance in science, while Ireland was sixth-equal with Taiwan in reading. In maths, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and the Netherlands were the only European entrants in the top 10. The UK&apos;s performance was virtually unchanged from its 2009 results, when its international rankings suffered with the addition of higher-placed new entrants such as Shanghai. It ranked 20th overall for science, 26th for maths and 23rd for reading \u2013 on a par with France and the US, and close to the OECD average for reading and maths. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD&apos;s deputy director for education and skills and co-ordinator of the Pisa programme, said the success of education systems such as Shanghai&apos;s was the result of an emphasis on selecting teachers, as well as prioritising investment in teacher training and development. Shanghai&apos;s lead was so clear that the results were the equivalent of its students having had three additional years of schooling, the OECD estimates. Outside Asia, Brazil, Germany and Mexico have all shown consistent improvement, with Germany, Mexico and Turkey winning praise for improving the performance of their weakest performing students, many of whom were from disadvantaged backgrounds. David Spieghalter, the Winton professor of the public understanding of risk at the University of Cambridge, said: &quot;Pisa explores many factors associated with country performance but occasionally seem hasty in assigning reasons for change \u2013 we can&apos;t decide causality from this study, and we should be very cautious in the lessons to be learned.&quot; Spieghalter added: &quot;If Pisa measures anything, it is the ability to do Pisa tests. Aligning policy along a single performance indicator can be damaging. We need to look at the whole picture.&quot; The OECD administered the standardised tests at the end of last year in 34 countries and a total of 64 regions, to 500,000 15-year-olds. According to the findings, girls performed worse than boys in maths exams in 37 regions and countries, although in the majority of cases the gap was small. In most countries the gender gap favoured girls in reading, while in science there was little difference. Schleicher said that the OECD found no evidence from its international analysis that competition between private, state or charter-style schools \u2013 free schools, in the UK \u2013 had any impact on raising standards. &quot;You would expect that systems with greater choice would come out better because you expect competition to raise performance of the high performers and lower performers, and put out of the market schools and systems that do not succeed. But in fact, you don&apos;t see a correlation,&quot; Schleicher said. &quot;Competition alone is not a predictor for better outcomes. And the UK is a good example: a highly competitive school system but still only an average performer.&quot; Instead, Schleicher said parents had higher priorities in choosing schools than simply academic results, according to the OECD&apos;s surveys of parental opinion. &quot;The most important thing for parents is not the performance of the school but what they call a safe school environment. And that is true for privileged and disadvantaged parents,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/03/us-japan-chinese-air-defence-zone-joe-biden", "publicationDate": "2013-12-03T14:54:00Z", "tags": ["Senkaku Islands", "Japan", "China", "US news", "Joe Biden", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["The zone covers more than 600 miles from north to south, above international waters separating China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan."], "title": "US vows to help Japan defend status quo as China air defence row escalates", "article": "The US and Japan will work together to prevent any attempt by China to change the status quo in the Asia-Pacific region, the US vice-president, Joe Biden, has said, on a visit to north-east Asia. His comments came at the start of a week-long trip that will be dominated by rising tensions between China and Japan over a territorial dispute. Biden, who will visit Japan, China and South Korea, is seeking to avoid escalation in the dispute, which intensified late last month when Beijing imposed an air defence identification zone (Adiz)] in an area of the East China Sea that includes the Senkaku islands \u2013 known as the Diaoyu islands in China \u2013 which Japan and China both lay claim to. Washington has been downplaying reports of disagreements between the US and Japan over the issue; a senior administration official travelling with Biden insisted there was &quot;no daylight&quot; between the two countries. Earlier in the day, Biden told reporters in Tokyo that the US-Japanese security arrangement was &quot;the cornerstone of security not merely in the Pacific basic but the cornerstone upon which our security is built for the next 20 years or more&quot;. Biden is accompanied on the Japanese-leg of the trip by Caroline Kennedy, the newly appointed US ambassador. A second senior official said the US intended to call on China to &quot;exercise restraint&quot; and &quot;avoid any other destabilising actions&quot;, including a new declarations of air defence zones. However, Biden and officials travelling with him have stopped short of calling on Beijing to &quot;rescind&quot; its declaration \u2013 a demand made by the state department on Monday. Speaking in Tokyo at the start of a visit that was supposed to have focused on strengthening economic ties between the US and the region, Biden said he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about China&apos;s abrupt imposition of the zone, saying it would raise regional tensions and increase the risk of accidents and miscalculation. Biden said he would raise US concerns with &quot;great specificity&quot; when he met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in Beijing later this week. He stopped short of calling on Beijing to scrap the zone, calling for better communication between Japan and China, whose leaders have not held official talks since taking office. But he said China&apos;s move had &quot;raised regional tensions and increased the risk of accidents and miscalculation&quot;. China insisted it would not rescind the procedures governing the air defence zone, despite US calls for it to do so. &quot;The fact that China&apos;s announcement has caused confusion and increased the risk of accidents only further underscores the validity of concerns and the need for China to rescind the procedures,&quot; Jen Psaki, the chief spokeswoman for the state department, said on Monday. The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, described the Chinese announcement of the zone nine days ago as &quot;a provocative attempt to unilaterally change the status quo&quot; that increased the risk of\u00a0inadvertent confrontation. While many countries \u2013 including the US and Japan \u2013 have similar zones, China&apos;s is controversial because it includes airspace over the disputed islands. But on Tuesday the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, told reporters: &quot;It is not China that has escalated the regional tensions. It is that some countries keep playing on the issue for their selfish gains, and China is firmly opposed to them doing that.&quot;\u00a0 Hong urged other countries to respect China&apos;s actions, which he described as &quot;justifiable and lawful&quot;. He added: &quot;China established it [the zone] to safeguard sovereignty and the freedom and order of flight in the related airspace.&quot; Concerns have grown of an accidental confrontation that could escalate. China said last week it had scrambled jets to monitor flights in the airspace by the US and Japan. But Shen Dingli, an expert at Fudan University in Shanghai on US-China relations, said: &quot;The US has not sent armed aircraft \u2026 China in turn does not send its fighters to fly towards B-52s.&quot; He added: &quot;There is no need to resolve the dispute: the dispute does not exist.\u00a0The US is messing around by not observing China&apos;s unilateral action. But in a similar way, China will soon be in a position to reciprocate by not observing [the US] Adiz.&quot; China&apos;s defence ministry said in a statement posted on its website on Tuesday that countries whose aircraft were not reporting their flight plans to China were &quot;irresponsible&quot;. But it added\u00a0that China considered the zone to be one of co-operation rather than confrontation. The zone covers more than 600 miles from north to south, above international waters separating China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. China says all aircraft entering the zone must notify the Chinese authorities beforehand or face unspecified &quot;emergency defensive measures&quot;. The rules apply to all aircraft passing through the zone, not just those heading towards Chinese airspace. Japan and the US believe the zone is an attempt by China to assert control over the islands. Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he and Biden had &quot;confirmed we should not tolerate any attempt by China to change the status quo unilaterally by force&quot;. Biden flew into Tokyo late on Monday faced with the delicate task of avoiding provoking China while demonstrating support for Japan, its main ally in a region already nervous about Chinese naval aggression and North Korea&apos;s nuclear weapons programme. Behind US pleas for Japan and China to reduce tensions lie fears that an accident or miscalculation could quickly escalate into armed conflict. The US raised hackles in Tokyo when it emerged that three US civilian airlines, acting on government advice, were complying with Chinese regulations and identifying their aircraft before flying through the zone. US officials insisted, however, that the move did &quot;not indicate US government acceptance of China&apos;s requirements&quot;. To underline Washington&apos;s opposition, two B-52 bombers flew into the area last week without notifying Chinese authorities. Japanese and South Korean military jets also flew through the zone in defiance of Chinese regulations. But the decision to advise US civilian airlines to comply was less than the unequivocal show of support that Japan had hoped for. Japan, by contrast, has urged Japanese airlines to ignore China&apos;s demands to submit flight plans in advance. &quot;China&apos;s declaration of an air defence identification zone is an attempt to unilaterally change the status quo, which can invite unexpected situations and is an extremely dangerous act,&quot; Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters before Biden&apos;s meeting with Abe. &quot;Japan and the United States share the position that China&apos;s Adiz is unacceptable \u2026 I think [Biden] will head to China to discuss various issues, including this, with his understanding of Japan&apos;s position.&quot; On Monday, Chinese officials attempted to exploit divergences in the approaches of Washington and Tokyo. Hong Lei, a foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters in Beijing the US had showed a &quot;constructive attitude&quot; but dismissed Japan&apos;s &quot;erroneous actions&quot;. In an editorial, the Global Times, a tabloid published by the Chinese Communist party&apos;s official People&apos;s Daily, cautioned Biden against offering unrestrained support for Japan&apos;s position on the air defence zone. &quot;The only choice he has if he wants a successful trip [to China] is not to go too far in his words over there,&quot; it said. &quot;If he openly supports Tokyo and wants to &apos;send an expedition to punish&apos; Beijing, the Chinese people won&apos;t accept it.&quot;\u00a0 Washington has refused to take sides in the simmering dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, a strategically important archipelago surrounded by rich fishing grounds and potentially large gas and mineral deposits. But the US recognises Japan&apos;s administrative control over the territories \u2013 reinforced just over a year ago, when Japan&apos;s government effectively nationalised the islands \u2013 and is obliged by its bilateral security treaty with Japan to defend its ally, should the diplomatic row escalate."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/03/gove-defends-education-reforms", "publicationDate": "2013-12-03T20:56:34Z", "tags": ["Michael Gove", "Free schools", "Schools", "Exams", "Education", "OECD", "Politics", "UK news"], "sentences": ["Responding to the OECD&apos;s programme for international student achievement (Pisa) \u2013 which showed no improvement compared with the previous rankings in 2009 \u2013 Gove said: &quot;For all the well-intentioned efforts of past governments, we are still falling further behind the best-performing school systems in the world.&quot;In Shanghai and Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong \u2013 indeed even in Taiwan and Vietnam \u2013 children are learning more and performing better with every year that passes, leaving our children behind in the global race.&quot; The OECD compiled the data for Pisa from the results of triennial tests in maths, science and reading given to 15-year-olds in the 65 countries and regions taking part.", "The top five places in maths were taken by the emerging economies of east Asia, with China&apos;s Shanghai region comfortably at the top, followed by Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea."], "title": "Michael Gove stands by school reforms", "article": "The education secretary, Michael Gove, has defended free schools, tougher exams and performance-related pay as needed to improve &quot;stagnant&quot; international rankings after figures published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) showed a persistent gap between British schoolchildren and their Asian peers. Responding to the OECD&apos;s programme for international student achievement (Pisa) \u2013 which showed no improvement compared with the previous rankings in 2009 \u2013 Gove said: &quot;For all the well-intentioned efforts of past governments, we are still falling further behind the best-performing school systems in the world.&quot;In Shanghai and Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong \u2013 indeed even in Taiwan and Vietnam \u2013 children are learning more and performing better with every year that passes, leaving our children behind in the global race.&quot; The OECD compiled the data for Pisa from the results of triennial tests in maths, science and reading given to 15-year-olds in the 65 countries and regions taking part. Overall, the UK was 21st for science, 23rd for reading and 26th for maths \u2013 a slight improvement in maths and reading offset by a decline in its world ranking in science, having been 16th in 2009. The previous rankings saw a sharp fall in the UK&apos;s overall standings, but this time its position was static, according to the OECD&apos;s Pisa co-ordinator, Andreas Schleicher: &quot;In essence you can say that the UK stands where it stood in 2009.&quot; &quot;UK schools are treading water when we know that matching the very best could boost the growth rate by one percentage point every year,&quot; said Katja Hall, the CBI&apos;s chief policy director. The top five places in maths were taken by the emerging economies of east Asia, with China&apos;s Shanghai region comfortably at the top, followed by Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. In Shanghai \u2013 a region of 20 million people \u2013 55% of students who took the maths test finished in the top two grades, compared with just 12% in the UK. Will Paxton, head of education for Save the Children, said: &quot;Looking at the countries which have started to leap ahead, one lesson stands out: they focus on ensuring no child falls behind in their education. &quot;We will never catch up with other countries without better early action when children are in primary school to make sure the poorest do not fall behind, particularly in key skills like maths and reading.&quot; Gove told parliament that it was too soon to see improvements as a result of changes introduced since 2010, but maintained that his reforms would improve England&apos;s standing. &quot;There is a strong correlation in these league tables between freedom for heads and improved results,&quot; Gove said. &quot;That is why we have dramatically increased the number of academies and free schools, and given heads more control over teacher training, continuous professional development and the improvement of under-performing schools.&quot; But Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, said Gove&apos;s determination that free schools and academies could hire untrained teachers was a recipe for further decline. Describing the Pisa result as &quot;a wake-up call,&quot; Hunt said Asia&apos;s top-performing regions employed highly qualified teachers and used strong networks of co-operation between schools. &quot;The lesson from Pisa is clear, that you have freedom with accountability, autonomy with minimum standards, or else you end up with the secretary of state&apos;s Al-Madinah school,&quot; Hunt said, referring to a controversial free school in Derby which has had its management replaced by the Department for Education. The education department said the maths results meant that 15-year-olds in the UK were three years behind their peers in Shanghai and two years behind those in Singapore, as well as a year behind those in the Netherlands. The government has recently approved a much tougher maths course at GCSE level in England, described by Mark Dawe, head of the OCR examination board, as &quot;a once in a generation opportunity to reduce the tidal wave of people moving into adult life without the skills to reach their full potential&quot;. Switzerland, the Netherlands and Finland were among the leading European nations, with Poland and Germany boasting improved results from previous years. But Sweden \u2013 previously held up as a model by Gove for its adoption of free schools, many run by for-profit companies \u2013 was shown to have suffered a swift decline, sparking a political debate within Sweden about the role of free schools. In recent months several free school chains in Sweden have been closed or collapsed. When the results for the UK were broken down by nation, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland showed results that were very similar. But Wales dipped further down, dropping from the equivalent of 20th in science to 36th and from 27th in reading to 41st. The weak results from Wales allowed Gove to claim that the Labour government in Cardiff &quot;acts almost as a control sample,&quot; saying: &quot;It is an object lesson in what happens when you abandon reform.&quot; Huw Lewis, education minister in the Welsh government, said: &quot;Everybody working in and around the Welsh education sector needs to take a long hard look in the mirror this week. The Pisa results are stark and the message is very clear, we must improve educational attainment and standards right across the board.&quot; Lewis said that reforms \u2013 including new reading and numeracy tests, secondary school banding, and extra funding for new schools \u2013 had been introduced since 2009. &quot;There are signs of some progress in reading, but significant improvement was never likely at this stage,&quot; he said. The US had the humiliation of seeing its performance in reading, maths and science surpassed by Vietnam, which entered Pisa for the first time. American students scored below average in maths and average for reading and science, with US education secretary Arne Duncan describing the results as a &quot;picture of educational stagnation&quot;. The Pisa tests Pisa is based on a set of exams in reading, maths and science administered to a representative sample of 15-year-olds in countries that pay to take part. In 2012 some 510,000 pupils in 65 countries and regions took the paper-based exams, each two hours long and asking a mixture of multiple-choice questions and written responses. The questions are divided into six levels of difficulty and are designed to test problem-solving rather than knowledge. Nine of the world&apos;s 20 largest countries did not take part in Pisa 2012, including India and Bangladesh, while Tunisia was the only African country to take part. Although the government of China holds the exam in multiple provinces, it only releases the results from Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macao. Pisa was first launched in 2000. Alongside the tests, the OECD conducts surveys of pupils, parents and school officials, as well as analysing the exam results by gender and socio-economic context."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/06/fishing-nations-fail-cut-tuna-quotas", "publicationDate": "2013-12-06T07:09:48Z", "tags": ["Fishing", "Australia news", "Asia Pacific", "China", "Taiwan", "South Korea", "Japan", "Environment", "Seafood", "Fish", "Food"], "sentences": ["The US, China, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia and Taiwan are responsible for 80% of bigeye tuna caught each year."], "title": "Large fishing nations fail to agree to deep cuts in Pacific tuna quotas", "article": "Major fishing nations have failed to agree to deep cuts in the amount of tuna caught in the Pacific Ocean, angering conservationists who claim unsustainable fishing is threatening the species. A week-long meeting of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, held in Cairns, has seen large fishing nations, such as the US and China, refuse to drastically reduce the amount of tuna they take from the Pacific. The 33 member states of the commission, which is tasked with ensuring sustainable fishing, negotiated a proposal to reduce the amount of yellowfin and bigeye tuna, which is regularly used in sashimi and sushi, by 2018. However, this proposal, along with a move to cut the amount of long line fishing, which is blamed for unnecessarily scouring tracts of ocean of fish, have failed to find a consensus agreement required to pass. The US, China, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia and Taiwan are responsible for 80% of bigeye tuna caught each year. In 2012, a record 2.6m tonnes of tuna was hauled from the Pacific \u2013 60% of the global total. The Cairns meeting has been viewed as a battle between large fishing nations such as the US and small Pacific nations, which have warned of the consequences of overfishing. Despite the lack of progress on cutting tuna quotas, the commission has agreed to a ban on fishing the silky shark, a near-threatened species that often ends up as bycatch. Large fishing vessels will also now have to carry unique identification numbers, similar to passenger and cargo ships. The move is aimed at reducing illegal and unreported fishing. \u201cThe big nations are the disappointing ones, given that they\u2019ve refused to take cuts in their quota,\u201d said Amanda Nickson, director of the Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 tuna conservation project. \u201cAll the scientific advice shows that tuna is being overfished. Bluefin tuna numbers, for example, are less than 4% what they were prior to being fished. \u201cThe week has been enormously frustrating. Although there has been progress on some measures, it\u2019s disappointing to see the commission fail on its core objective, which is to ensure sustainable fishing.

The legal dispute underscores the tough geopolitical approach China is adopting in the Pacific region. It has adopted an aggressive approach toward neighbours over a 2,000-mile stretch that also includes the East China Sea, over which it recently declared the air defence identification zone that has inflamed tensions with Japan and South Korea. China sent its only aircraft carrier to the disputed waters off the coast of the Philippines for the first time last week, in a move Manila said raised tensions. China\u2019s military said the carrier Liaoning will conduct drills in the area, accompanied by two destroyers and two frigates. Dealing with the fallout over China\u2019s territorial claims has become the dominant issue for the US vice-president, Joe Biden, who is currently touring the Asia Pacific region.\u00a0 Biden arrived in South Korea on Thursday after high-level bilateral meetings in China and Japan that were dominated by the issue of the air defence zone. The Philippines will submit its formal case to the UN arbitration tribunal of judges, which has agreed to hear the case at The Hague, in March. A preview of their arguments were outlined this week in Washington by Paul Reichler, an expert attorney at Foley Hoag LLP hired by Manila to handle the case. He said China\u2019s blank refusal to participate in the tribunal process, a move it revealed to the Philippines by way of diplomatic letter in February, marked the first time a state had ever refused to take part in an inter-state arbitration under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.\u00a0 Under the convention, the panel of senior international judges is still required to issue a ruling in the case, despite China\u2019s non-cooperation, although Reichler conceded there were no way of enforcing any ruling. But he added: \u201cThere is a price to be paid for branding yourself an international outlaw \u2013 a state that does not comply with the rules.\u201d China declined an opportunity to comment on the case. The dispute concerns China\u2019s declaration of the so-called nine-dash line, which claims jurisdiction over nearly all of the mineral-rich South China Sea, overlapping with large segments of territory claimed by the Philippines as well as of Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. In parts, China\u2019s declared jurisdiction, which enables it to exploit lucrative fishing waters and potential oil and gas reserves, stretch more than 800 miles from its mainland coast. It also comes to within 30 miles of the coast of the Philippines. Under the convention, states have a right to an exclusive economic zone and continental shelf within 200 miles of their coast. Disputes over the South China Sea are not unlike those over the Japanese-administered Senkaku islands \u2013 referred to as the Diaoyu islands in China \u2013 which are dominating Biden\u2019s visits to Japan, China and South Korea this week. Although the ad-hoc tribunal formed to deal with the case cannot rule on the sovereignty of the islands claimed by both China and the Philippines, it can provide rulings about the nature of rock formations, with implications for any territorial claims under the convention. Some of the disputed territories are barely visible at high tide, while others are fully submerged even at low tide. In a bid to strengthen its claims, China has constructed concrete installations on some underwater formations, complete with basketballs and helipads. \u201cA state cannot transform an underwater feature into an island by building on top of it,\u201d Reichler said at a seminar organised by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In simple terms, the judges will in part be asked to determine when a rock can be defined as an island. If a rock protruding from the sea cannot sustain human life or economic activity, for example, the associated rights in surrounding waters are, under the convention, dramatically reduced, regardless of which state claims ownership. Reichler also showed one slideshow of an island that, at high-tide, consisted of rocks that only just protruded out of the water. \u201cIt is barely big enough to support the Filipino flag,\u201d he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/dec/09/students-protest-grade-complain-university-courses", "publicationDate": "2013-12-09T14:00:00Z", "tags": ["Students", "Research", "Higher education", "Education"], "sentences": ["The researchers talked with many (specifically: 10) students, who hailed originally from Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Hong Kong or Taiwan."], "title": "Do students complain about university courses?

One attempted to measure how students complain; another, how they intend to complain. A\u00a0third team tried to gauge students&apos; attitudes to complaining. These are not easy to measure well, or consistently. In 2010, David Hart and Nigel Coates, at Northumbria University&apos;s Newcastle business school, published a study called International Student Complaint Behaviour: How Do East Asian Students Complain To Their University? in the Journal of Further and Higher Education. They interviewed students at a UK higher education institution, but they masked its identity, revealing only that it was &quot;a large UK university&quot; with a total of 31,000 registered students, a staff-to-student ratio of 22:1, and that it &quot;has been ranked 73rd in the 2009 Good University Guide&quot;. The researchers talked with many (specifically: 10) students, who hailed originally from Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Hong Kong or Taiwan. The data accumulated from this sampling led Hart and Coates to the finding that &quot;East Asian students are willing to share their dissatisfactory experiences with university staff&quot;. Hart and Coates caution that their investigation came up against some limits. First, &quot;the fact that the interviews were conducted in English may have presented some problems to the respondents being able to accurately convey their opinions&quot;. Second, their &quot;apparent willingness to complain is mediated by a common fear amongst respondents that complaining about a lecturer or course may affect the grades they receive from the university&quot;. In 2011, At Pace University in New York City, business school researchers Vishal Lala and Randi Priluck surveyed how each of 288 students might intend to go about complaining. Lala and Priluck published a study in the Journal of Marketing Education, in which they announce their major discovery: that &quot;students complain to the school only if the effort involved is minimal and they believe the school will respond&quot;. That&apos;s not the whole story, of course. Lala and Priluck say some students would be inclined to complain not to the school, but to their friends and to &quot;unknown others&quot;. Influenced by &quot;personal characteristics&quot;, some of those would-be complainers say they would complain in person; others indicate a preference for grousing on the web. In 2012, Graham Ferguson and Ian Phau, business school researchers at Curtin University in Perth, peppered survey questions at 462 students in Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia. Ferguson and Phau say the Malaysian students enjoy a &quot;more positive attitude&quot; to complaining than do the Indonesian students, whilst the Indonesians are more positive than the Australians. All three teams \u2013 Hart and Coates, Lala and Priluck, and Ferguson and Phau \u2013 complain, in a positive manner, of a need for further research about student complaining. \u2022 Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly Annals of Improbable Research and organiser of the Ig Nobel prize"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/09/britain-now-developing-country-foodbanks-growth", "publicationDate": "2013-12-09T20:00:00Z", "tags": ["Economics", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Business", "Global development", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Society"], "sentences": ["Sift through the evidence and a different picture emerges: Britain&apos;s economy is no longer zooming along unchallenged in the fast lane, but an increasingly clapped-out motor regularly overtaken by Asian Tigers such as South Korea and Taiwan."], "title": "Let's admit it: Britain is now a developing country | Aditya Chakrabortty", "article": "Elite economic debate boils down to this: a man in a tie stands at a dispatch box and reads out some numbers for the years ahead, along with a few micro-measures he&apos;ll take to improve those projections.

Last Thursday&apos;s autumn statement from George Osborne was merely the latest enactment of this twice-yearly ritual, and I bet you&apos;ve already forgotten it. Compare his forecasts and fossicking with our fundamental problems. Start with last week&apos;s Pisa educational yardsticks, which show British teenagers trailing their Vietnamese counterparts at science, and behind the Macanese at maths. Or look at this year&apos;s World Economic Forum (WEF) competitiveness survey of 148 countries, which ranks British roads below Chile&apos;s, and our ground-transport system worse than that of Barbados. Whether Blair or Brown or Cameron, successive prime ministers and their chancellors pretend that progress is largely a matter of trims and tweaks \u2013 of capping business rates and funding the A14 to Felixstowe. Yet those Treasury supplementary tables and fan charts are no match for the mass of inconvenient facts provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the WEF or simply by going for a wander. Sift through the evidence and a different picture emerges: Britain&apos;s economy is no longer zooming along unchallenged in the fast lane, but an increasingly clapped-out motor regularly overtaken by Asian Tigers such as South Korea and Taiwan. Gender equality? The WEF ranks us behind Nicaragua and Lesotho. Investment by business? The Economist thinks we are struggling to keep up with Mali. Let me put it more broadly, Britain is a rich country accruing many of the stereotypical bad habits of a developing country. I began thinking about this last week, while reporting on graphene, the wonder material discovered by Manchester scientists and held up by cabinet ministers as part of our new high-tech future. Graphene is also the point at which Treasury dreaminess is harshly interrupted by the reality of our national de-development. Briefly, the story goes like this: Osborne funnelled a few tens of millions into research on the substance. It&apos;s the kind of public-sector kickstart that might work in a manufacturing economy such as Germany \u2013 but which in Britain, with its hollowed-out industry and busted supply chains, has proved the equivalent of pouring money down a hole. One university physicist described how this was part of a familiar pattern of generating innovations for the rest of the world to capitalise on, then sighed: &quot;One day, we&apos;ll stop thinking of ourselves as a major economic power, and realise we&apos;re more like South Korea in the early 60s.&quot; South Korea, by way of comparison, has already put in over 20 times as many graphene patents as the country that discovered it. How can any nation that came up with the BBC and the NHS be considered in the same breath as India or China? Let me refer you to one of the first lines of The Great Indian Novel by Shashi Tharoor, in which a wise old man warns International Monetary Fund officials and foreign dignatories: &quot;India is not, as people keep calling it, an underdeveloped country, but rather, in the context of its history and cultural heritage, a highly developed one in an advanced state of decay.&quot; Stop thinking of development as a process that only goes in one direction, or which affects a nation&apos;s people equally, and it becomes much easier to see how Britain is going backwards. Even banana republics have cash: it just ends up in the hands of a very few people \u2013 ask the bank managers of Switzerland or the hotel concierges of Paris. In Britain, we have become used to having our resources skimmed off by a small cadre of the international elite, who often don&apos;t feel obliged to leave much behind for our tax officials. An Africa specialist could look at the City and recognise in it a 21st-century version of a resource curse: something generating oodles of money for a tiny group of people, often foreign, yet whose demands distort the rest of the economy. Sure, Britain has iPads and broadband \u2013 but it also has oversubscribed foodbanks. And the concept of the working poor that has dominated political debate since the crash is also something straight out of development textbooks. Nobel laureate Amartya Sen defined development as &quot;the removal of various types of unfreedoms that leave people with little choice and little opportunity of exercising their reasoned agency&quot;. Yet when it comes to social mobility, Britain now has the worst record of all advanced countries \u2013 and will soon be overtaken by the newly rich countries of east Asia. And it&apos;s when wealth is concentrated in too few hands that the forces of law and order get used as a militia for the elite \u2013 and peaceful dissent gets stamped upon. That&apos;s why police are now a presence on our business-friendly university campuses; it also explains why Theresa May had the front to try to deport Trenton Oldfield for disrupting a student rowing competition (sorry, the Boat Race). This isn&apos;t a sub-Rhodesian moan about Britain going to the dogs. But as my colleague Larry Elliott said in his most recent book, Going South, the sooner we puncture our own complacency at having created a rich economy for the few, and think of ourselves as in dire need of a proper economic development plan, the better. Otherwise, we&apos;re well set to corner the world\u00a0market in pig semen.

These are the dilemmas of success. To put them into context, it&apos;s worth going back to 1948, the year the NHS was founded. Then male life expectancy was 66 and female, 71; in both cases it&apos;s risen by more than 10 years, and it&apos;s continuing to rise quite fast. In 1984, there were 660,000 people in Britain over 85; today, there are more than 1.4 million. This is the achievement of better nutrition and housing, as well as more successful medical science. A host of diseases are now less deadly than they once were \u2013 heart disease (although it remains the biggest killer), stroke, tuberculosis, diabetes and bronchitis. But we all die of something. This great success, increased life expectancy, means that cancer and dementia impinge on our fears more than ever. More frail people live on every street. We are a country heading towards having a million people with dementia. Add the fact that survivors of cancer, stroke and heart disease often require long-term care, and it&apos;s not hard to see why there is a caring crisis in modern Britain. Three in five people will become carers at some point in their lives. The great Tory criticism of the NHS, back in 1948 and today, is that it took responsibility off the shoulders of individuals and pretended the state could look after everyone. Mostly, that criticism has fallen silent because the NHS has coincided with a great period of health and medical success, and we love it for that. More people, particularly more poorer people, are now stronger and live longer, thanks to advances in medicine. But the welfare state can&apos;t do everything \u2013 never could, and never will be able to. For a civilised society to function, families and private individuals need to help one another \u2013 to help relatives, friends and neighbours \u2013 and not simply leave it all to welfare services. That&apos;s always been true but it&apos;s particularly so at a time when the public finances are still in such a mess. At the moment, almost every political proposal is thrown against that brutal optimism-destroyer: &quot;But where&apos;s the money coming from?&quot; These are not times to suggest extra rights, extra services or extra anything, it seems. But Carers UK believes it is exactly the right time to call for a legal right to a minimum of five days&apos; paid &quot;care leave&quot; and for a debate on rights to longer periods of leave to care for disabled, older or seriously or terminally ill loved ones. Five days isn&apos;t much, I know, but it would allow a bit of crisis management when someone comes out of hospital, or a relative suddenly worsens: it would allow a daughter, son or neighbour to sort out the immediate emergency. At the moment, you can be sacked for behaving like a decent human being and staying away from work to look after somebody in desperate straits. We keep being told there is no money for an expansion of the welfare state \u2013 so, as people get older, what, please, is the alternative? Leaving them to die at home in a state of confusion and malnutrition? As I have written here before, the cost of the state taking on all the unpaid work being done by carers would be prohibitive. The figures are remarkable. Carers UK says some 3 million people are juggling work and caring responsibilities, and 2.3 million have given up work entirely to look after others. Together that&apos;s the entire population of Scotland. The cost to the economy is estimated by Age UK at \u00a35.3 billion a year. The sad stories are of those who have lost a good job because they did the right thing and helped, finding themselves cut adrift. The sadder stories still are of those who hung on at work and allowed a father or mother to die without being there, and who carry the guilt for the rest of their\u00a0lives. Giving these people a little bit of help and legal protection is an obvious, commonsense idea. Given how many of us are carers or being cared for, or have somebody close to us in that situation, it ought to be a very popular idea as well. Reassuringly, it is. A YouGov opinion poll published today finds that 89% \u2013 nine out of 10 people \u2013 agree with calls for new help for carers. For me, this is the new frontline. When I was a young woman, the battle was for paid maternity leave, something attacked at the time as ridiculous but now completely accepted. Surrounded by an ageing and vulnerable population, politics demands action on this now. Maternity leave was the inevitable result of women entering the workforce as equal partners. Carer&apos;s leave will be the inevitable result of an ageing society. Business organisations will protest that it&apos;s an extra burden and may even disadvantage them against foreign rivals. I hope they do \u2013 and then look abroad, because the fact is that Britain lags far behind almost every competitor in this. Taiwan, Japan, the US, France and the Netherlands are just some of the countries that have already confronted the problems of an ageing population by introducing family-care policies. Employees in Ireland can take up to 104 weeks of unpaid leave to look after someone needing full-time care. Although the leave is unpaid, the carer may receive carer&apos;s benefit or carer&apos;s allowance. Another shining example is Germany, where six months&apos; unpaid long-term care leave is allowed, followed by up to two years of reduced working hours, to a minimum of 15 hours a week. There are plenty of good schemes we could copy \u2013 it&apos;s just that agreeing the principle needs to come first."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/13/australians-plan-to-leave-more-inheritance-to-their-heirs", "publicationDate": "2013-12-13T08:56:13Z", "tags": ["Australia news"], "sentences": ["The survey questioned people in Australia, the US, UK, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Canada, France, China, Brazil, UAE, Mexico, Malaysia, India and Egypt."], "title": "Australians plan to leave more inheritance to their heirs", "article": "Australian retirees plan to leave more inheritance to their heirs than any other nationality, but those still working aren\u2019t expecting it, a report by HSBC has revealed. The \u201clife after work\u201d survey of 16,000 people in 15 countries also found that about three in four semi-retirees wish they had worked full-time for longer, and 12% of working age people expect they will never be able to afford full retirement. The survey questioned people in Australia, the US, UK, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Canada, France, China, Brazil, UAE, Mexico, Malaysia, India and Egypt. The vast majority of retirees in these countries \u2013 69% \u2013 expect to leave a financial inheritance to their children, and of these people almost a third say they will definitely do so. The median amount they expect to leave for the kids is US$148,205 globally, but retired Australians surveyed said they expected to bequeath a median of US$501,909 each. It may come as a surprise to their children. The survey also asked people who are not yet fully retired how much they expected to inherit and the median response was a much lower $131,801. But this amount was still higher than any other country surveyed. Graham Heunis, head of retail banking and wealth management for HSBC in Australia, says the unusually high amount suggested by Australian retirees is down to the nation\u2019s 22-years of economic prosperity. \u201cOver the past decade Australian household wealth has grown 7.6% per year, making us one of the richest nations per capita globally, allowing retirees to provide their children a significant financial legacy,\u201d he said. Not that it will necessarily have a huge effect. Only 36% of non-retirees who had received an inheritance told the survey that it made saving for their own retirement any easier and 14% said it actually made it more difficult. Globally, 25% of survey respondents said they received a significant financial loan or gift from their parents, with the highest rate of financial gift recipients in India with 53%. The report said 21% of fully retired Australian respondents had received a financial gift and 5% had been given a loan by their parents, both at a median value of US$26,590. \u201cSuch gifts or loans from family were given for a wide range of uses, including major life events such as getting married (25%), children\u2019s education fees (24%), major purchases (23%), or help with housing costs (22%),\u201d said the report. The survey also found 43% of Australian retirees\u2019 income is funded by state pensions and benefits. It was slightly above the 37% global average, but well behind the world leader France, where state benefits and pensions funded 83% of retirement income."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/17/vaginal-knitting-artist-defence", "publicationDate": "2013-12-17T00:30:46Z", "tags": ["Performance art", "Knitting", "Craft"], "sentences": ["My image and imagery of my work has zipped through minds from Nigeria to Taiwan to Finland yet, in many ways, the personal impact has been less than the dreams of a few friends that I felt marked me more firmly into existence."], "title": "I'm the 'vaginal knitting' perfomance artist \u2013 and I want to defend my work | Casey Jenkins", "article": "A couple of years ago, three separate friends told me that they\u2019d dreamt of me the previous night. My cameo appearances weren\u2019t spectacular (in my friend Meg\u2019s dream, I was cast as a taxation specialist) but the coincidence struck me as poignant. That ephemeral images of me had floated unbidden into three distinct dream worlds made me feel, somehow, that I existed more solidly in this one. Over the past two weeks, over 3.5m people have watched the YouTube clip shot by SBS2 documenting my 28 day performance piece, Casting Off My Womb, at Darwin\u2019s DVAA. The short clip, which SBS2 titled Vaginal Knitting, gives an overview of the work in which I used skeins of wool lodged in my vaginal tunnel to knit a long passage, marking one full menstrual cycle. My image and work have been consumed, contemplated and commented on by millions across the globe. It\u2019s interesting then, and gives an insight into the performance\u2019s heart,\u00a0that all of this electronic crackle and buzz has not altered my identification with it at all. My image and imagery of my work has zipped through minds from Nigeria to Taiwan to Finland yet, in many ways, the personal impact has been less than the dreams of a few friends that I felt marked me more firmly into existence. The response to the clip was immediate, massive and, for the most part, negative, marked with fear and repulsion. The word &quot;ick&quot; features heavily, as do &quot;eww&quot;, &quot;gross&quot; and &quot;whyyyy?&quot;. Exclamation points are afforded entire comment boxes, broken only by the odd question mark. Everything comes in for criticism; the menstrual blood used in the work probably cops the most, but viewers have taken swipes at my hair-cut, my eyebrows, my skin, my home-city, my choice of words, my knitting technique and the colour of my shirt. The nature of the response wasn\u2019t unexpected, but the scale of it was and it\u2019s been fascinating to watch.     Some of the criticisms levelled at the author.    Although the obvious conceptual disjunct between the vagina and knitting is probably what has arrested the web\u2019s attention, it is an entirely different body part that seems to infuriate the most: my face. Commentators seem to be genuinely outraged that I would dare to do something that they view as strange and repulsive with my body without displaying shame.\u00a0Women putting themselves forward in any capacity in the world is frowned upon, and for a woman to put herself forward in a way that is not designed to be attractive or pleasing is downright seditious. People are incensed!     Over 3.5m people have watched the YouTube clip.    One of the most common comments in forums is that I am an &quot;attention seeker&quot; \u2013 levelled as a clear criticism. But as an artist, I do seek attention for my work \u2013 I want to express and communicate ideas, and I refuse to feel compunction for that. What I am\u00a0not\u00a0seeking through this work is external validation of myself \u2013 in fact, the work is primarily about casting off the need for validation from external sources. As the deafening response to my work demonstrates, there is a hell of a lot of clamouring noise in society about what a person with a body like mine should and shouldn\u2019t be doing with it. The pitch\u00a0and volume of opinions can be so overwhelming that it\u2019s difficult to quiet the noise, step back and choose a clear and autonomous path. With Casting Off My Womb I have attempted to do just that by paring concepts about body parts and activities related to women back to their most elemental. Over the course of the month I sat with the steady rhythm of the knitting needles and of my body and created a work that I have complete confidence in, a confidence that thousands of internet opinions have not dinted.     The artist knitting. Photograph: Casey Jenkins    In the gallery setting, viewers responded with more circumspection and respect than they have in subsequent internet forums. I have hopes that after the noise of the visceral reaction dies down on the web, people might take time to consider why they responded the way they did. That they will stop trying to dictate what I do with my body and spend some time contemplating why they feel such a strong need to do so. But regardless of whether they take that path or not, I am proud of Casting Off My Womb. I have created a performance piece that I believe is beautiful and valid and I know that this belief can withstand all the negativity in the world.\u00a0I had hoped to create a work that was about forging a path of self-determination in the face of society\u2019s expectations, but until it was tested in such a public forum that was something I could only dream of."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/19/holden-departure-crunch-time-community-in-crisis", "publicationDate": "2013-12-19T05:00:24Z", "tags": ["Australia news", "Manufacturing sector", "Holden", "Australian politics", "Automotive industry"], "sentences": ["\u201cYou say to international visitors, \u2018this is what we do over here\u2019, but at the end of the day, most of our stuff is now marked with made in China, or Taiwan or whatever."], "title": "\u2018When Holden leaves it\u2019s crunch time,\u2019 says anxious SA community", "article": "As the argument raged about the adequacy of the federal package to soften the blow of Holden\u2019s departure, the community of Elizabeth in the northern suburbs of Adelaide was trying to fully quantify losses that seemed to go far beyond that of one local car factory. The bare fact is that the factory in question, built in 1958 and employing 1,600 people, will wind up in 2017 when Holden pulls out of Australian manufacturing. But the death of the plant brings the threat of other casualties. Some fear the loss of a local business, others of a home, a beloved brand, a national industrial heritage. Darryl Waterman has worked at Elizabeth for 16 years after transferring from a company supplying painted plastic parts to Holden and Mitsubishi at Tonsley Park (Mitsubishi pulled out of South Australia in 2008). He said most workers did not yet know what they were going to do once the factory closed. \u201cWe were trying to keep the place going by accepting a pay freeze earlier this year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe realise there\u2019s no hope for that now.\u201d Waterman said he would probably need to move interstate because prospects for new jobs in Elizabeth \u2013 a suburb with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country at 21.3% (2011 figures) \u2013 were dire. \u201cEven though people say this sort of thing happens all the time and industry gets absorbed by the rest of the community, this area does not have a lot of prospects,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of moving up to Darwin because I hear there\u2019s a lot of work up there, but here on the production line there\u2019s a couple of guys I worry about. \u201cThey came straight out of school with no skills about 25 to 30 years ago and I think some of those guys will find it real hard to find employment after this.\u201d Nearby, cafe owner Van Hua had already noticed a negative impact on trade. Holden workers were regular buyers of coffee in the mornings but Hua says they could no longer afford it. \u201cEven though they\u2019re still working, they have to save their money now for a rainy day,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing worse than finding out that you don\u2019t have a job tomorrow.\u201d He worried about the older Holden workers and their ability to compete with younger people for jobs, particularly in Elizabeth. \u201cBut indirectly or directly, the entire country will be affected,\u201d Hua said. \u201cSay a husband works at Holden and his wife works in the hospital. When Holden shuts they will have just one income. This means they have to cut all their expenses and, for example, buy less clothes for children. The clothing stores lose money. The textile guys suffers. There just won\u2019t be as much money going around.\u201d Waterman said the manufacturing industry had been dwindling ever since the Australian dollar started rising and Holden\u2019s pullout should be treated as a wake-up call. \u201cIf we can lose something like Holden, then no manufacturing is really stable or secure in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a reason why developing countries across the world are trying to get car industries going in their country. They recognise it helps progress.\u201d Holden spends an average of $1.75bn a year on Australian-supplied components and parts \u2013 $21bn between 2001 and 2012. Many of the companies involved, such as those in the supply park across the road from Holden at Elizabeth, are expected to lose business, shed jobs and, potentially, shut up shop along with Holden in 2017. G\u00f6ran Roos, Advanced Manufacturing Council chairman, estimated it would result in about 7,000 people becoming unemployed in SA, creating a \u201cmajor\u201d negative impact that would create short-term unemployment, crime, mental health problems, poverty, social misery and housing issues that would take up to 10 years to recover from. He said the decision to allow Holden to leave showed an underestimation of the importance of manufacturing to Australia, which has a significantly lower ability than Japan, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Korea and the US to benefit from new entrepreneurs. \u201cWhat you want as a country are manufacturing firms with as large a share as possible of the chain within the country, and with high value adding that also contributes to economic complexity,\u201d Roos said. \u201cThe value added in the automotive industrial system in Australia adds up to around $12.5bn and the tax on this alone will generate an amount equal to the subsidy \u2013 not counting the income tax of the 45,000 employees in the system, nor the GST on their spending or any other benefit. \u201cIt is absolutely clear that the subsidy outweighs the benefit.\u201d Rod Rebbeck, managing director for Multi Slide Industries in Edwardstown, considers his company luckier than some. He makes wire frames for Holden\u2019s sedan seats as well as a number of brackets and clips, but he also has a diverse customer base outside of Holden. His business will continue, but if he cannot replace Holden\u2019s workload, he will have to shed up to nine workers from a staff of 40 \u2013 which has already been reduced from 158 people six years ago. \u201cBack in those days we used to do all the dishwasher baskets for Electrolux, and supplied Hills Industries, Kelvinator air conditioners and Simpson washing machines, but that\u2019s all gone now,\u201d Rebbeck said. \u201cAutomotive is about the last thing we\u2019ve got going in Australia.\u201d Rebbeck said Australia\u2019s annual contribution to the automobile industry was about $18 a year per taxpayer, which paled in comparison to an estimated $90 per person in Germany and around $200 in the US. Australians would be paying the same money as a result of the people out of work, he said, and the lost manufacturing expertise would never be recovered. \u201cI think a lot of people don\u2019t recognise just how huge the ripple effect of this is going to be,\u201d Rebbeck said. \u201cWe have transport trucks that take our seats out to Elizabeth at least once, sometimes twice a day. \u201cThese guys won\u2019t have a job because they basically work for us. And then there\u2019s the guy who puts the tyres on the trucks, the guy who services the trucks, the bloke who services the forklift. When Holden leaves it\u2019s crunch time.\u201d Michael Claridge, managing director at Claridge Holden, a four-generation family business at Malvern that has been selling Holden cars since 1961, has just overseen a $6m revamp to the business\u2019s display rooms and service centre. His greatest concern was the effect on the wider South Australian economy. He described the complexities of car manufacturing as \u201cenormous\u201d. The situation was even worse for South Australia because BHP Billiton put its Olympic Dam mining expansion at Roxby Downs on the backburner 16 months ago, which was expected to bring an estimated $45.7bn to SA over 30 years, he said. Claridge was keen to point out that while Holden is moving offshore, the brand will remain in Australia along with its product line, service centres and parts supply, and a new Commodore \u2013 \u201cthe best Holden\u2019s ever produced\u201d was in the works to be released in about 18 months. \u201cWhile it\u2019s a sad day that production will cease in Australia, it sounds like we\u2019re going to go out with a bang,\u201d he said. It offers small comfort for Ute Musters in SA member and Holden enthusiasts such as Chloe Fennell, a fuel pump technician who is also studying for a heavy automotive trade certificate near the Elizabeth factory. She said people like her perceived the new Commodore as the last of a good thing and were lamenting the loss of Holden from the country as another phase in the slow death of Australian manufacturing as a whole. &quot;It will open the way for the international market to finish off Australia\u2019s automotive industry just as it has with everything else,\u201d Fennell said.  \u201cAs a country we\u2019re losing what we\u2019ve been proud to have. \u201cYou say to international visitors, \u2018this is what we do over here\u2019, but at the end of the day, most of our stuff is now marked with made in China, or Taiwan or whatever. \u201cThere\u2019s not many manufacturers left in Australia, let alone SA.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/19/stories-of-2013-caroline-criado-perez-twitter", "publicationDate": "2013-12-19T06:00:00Z", "tags": ["Twitter", "Media", "Internet", "Blogging", "Technology", "UK news", "Women", "Life and style", "Gender", "Caroline Criado-Perez"], "sentences": ["Her father was a self-made businessman who began selling handmade dolls on the streets and she had an itinerant childhood, moving to Spain, Portugal, Taiwan and then to public school in Britain when she was 11."], "title": "Caroline Criado-Perez: 'I speak as someone  psychologically scarred'", "article": "The day after two people were charged for allegedly sending abusive tweets to the feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, she proves difficult to reach on her mobile phone. Criado-Perez has fled London for the countryside, where her signal struggles to penetrate the stone walls of her mother&apos;s house, providing some respite, not just from the Guardian, but the online abuse that seems to have spiked again since the charges were brought. A year ago, Criado-Perez was a little known campaigner and journalist studying for an MA in gender studies. In the past 12 months, she has successfully persuaded the Bank of England to keep the image of a woman other than the Queen on banknotes and become well known for her stance against online misogynists. Yet for all her achievements, it has not been an easy time. &quot;It has been unprecedented, completely mad and deeply unpleasant,&quot; she says. &quot;That&apos;s my overriding feeling and I wish it wasn&apos;t. The awfulness was so awful that it took away from anything else.&quot; The &quot;awfulness&quot;, as she calls it, began with an abusive tweet the day after the then new Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, agreed to her demands to recognise the achievements of just one woman among the five portraits on our banknotes. Her &quot;elation&quot; was short-lived as the one abusive tweet soon became a &quot;huge avalanche&quot; and included vicious threats of rape and other violence. In September, having &quot;really hit rock bottom and had some kind of breakdown&quot;, Criado-Perez quit Twitter for a month. She is considering another temporary &quot;deactivation&quot; of her account during her Christmas break but is nervous of saying so as her last attempt also prompted another wave of abuse. &quot;I go up and down but at the moment I&apos;m in a pretty bad place,&quot; she admits. &quot;I am reaching boiling point and am incredibly stressed. I feel angry, upset, scared of opening my inbox or looking at my mentions [on Twitter]. I feel under attack all the time \u2026 I feel like I&apos;m the go-to person to send abuse to now.&quot; That morning, she received an email calling her a &quot;fat ugly twat&quot; and had had &quot;a bit of a rant&quot; on Twitter after a barrage of comments suggesting she only went to the police for the notoriety. In two tweets, she wrote: &quot;For the benefit of idiots: I sought equality for women. I did not seek death &amp; threats, or thousands of followers whose sole purpose seems to be telling me how shit I am. You want &quot;fame&quot;? You think it&apos;s so fucking awesome? Try it for a fucking day. Have your bloody platform.&quot; Now she regrets losing her temper: &quot;I haven&apos;t dealt with it very well. I am speaking as someone really psychologically scarred by this.&quot; Criado-Perez, 29, was born in Brazil to an Argentinian father and an English mother. Her father was a self-made businessman who began selling handmade dolls on the streets and she had an itinerant childhood, moving to Spain, Portugal, Taiwan and then to public school in Britain when she was 11. Some critics suggest she simply stay off of Twitter to avoid the abuse but as Criado-Perez says: &quot;Getting off Twitter is just not an option for me \u2013 it&apos;s how I do my activism, how I work. I would love to close down my email facility but I can&apos;t, I need it for work.&quot; Part of the problem is the sense that online abuse is not in the same league as offline threats, yet she sees both as part of a culture in which women are undervalued and their fears ignored. The campaign that in many ways started the whole thing off \u2013 against the Bank of England&apos;s decision to drop Elizabeth Fry, the only woman, from banknotes \u2013 is part of a culture which &quot;consistently undervalues women&quot;, she says. She is critical of US-based social media companies such as Twitter which cite freedom of speech issues for failing to act and describes abuse which aims to silence women as itself &quot;anti-democracy anti-freedom of speech&quot;. Criado-Perez is critical of the new &quot;blocking&quot; button brought in by Twitter which continues to allow users to follow and retweet from accounts they have been blocked from. Women&apos;s groups are calling on the police and prosecution to treat abuse of women and girls online as &quot;robustly&quot; as they do offline. Holly Dustin, director of the the End Violence Against Women Coalition (EVAW) said: &quot;Rape threats online should be treated with the same seriousness as if they happened in the street or on the bus. They need to treat abuse online in the same way as they do offline.&quot; A young woman, 23-year-old Isabella Sorley, as well as 25-year-old John Nimmo have been charged with improper use of a communications network for allegedly abusing Criado-Perez. It is the attacks from women online that seem to upset Criado-Perez most. In early December there was a &quot;big flare-up of abuse \u2026 [with] all the women attacking me \u2026 saying stuff like how rubbish the banknote campaign was&quot;. The abuse she allegedly received from the two charged wasn&apos;t even the worst, she said. Yet she will be glad when the case is over, whatever the outcome. With her MA dissertation due next September, she is thinking of writing about gender equality in the criminal justice system and the need for &quot;greater victim awareness&quot;. &quot;This year has been unlike any other in my life. I&apos;ve gone from being someone nobody knows, to someone that quite a lot of people have a very strong opinion on. It&apos;s weird going from anonymity to a kind of fame \u2013 and an overnight one, one that wasn&apos;t because of anything you can be proud of. One that comes from an experience that has left you emotionally and psychologically scarred. &quot;I have tried to cope with this new-found notoriety, but I haven&apos;t always dealt with it very well. I haven&apos;t learnt yet how to cope with people who don&apos;t know me thinking they have access to my innermost thoughts and hating me for them. I haven&apos;t learnt to cope with the sheer volume of people wanting to tell me they hate me, think I&apos;m great, can I read this, do that, come here, go there, opine on this, denounce that. I haven&apos;t learnt to switch it off and realise I have to say no sometimes, if only for the sake of my sanity. And it&apos;s been exhausting.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/19/headteacher-michael-gove-tricia-kelleher-education-reforms", "publicationDate": "2013-12-19T14:23:18Z", "tags": ["Education policy", "Schools", "Education", "Michael Gove", "UK news", "Politics", "Primary schools", "Secondary schools", "National curriculum", "Exams", "Private schools"], "sentences": ["The league table, whose UK results reflect the performance of children educated mainly under the last Labour government, was topped by east Asian countries, including China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea."], "title": "Top UK headteacher: Michael Gove is 'pressing the rewind button'", "article": "The principal of the British school ranked top in the world in the international baccalaureate diploma has launched a passionate attack on Michael\u00a0Gove&apos;s education reforms. Tricia Kelleher accused the education secretary of &quot;pressing the rewind button&quot; and warned that attempts to chase global education-league rankings will lead schools into a creativity-free &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; of learning. The head of the independent Stephen Perse Foundation in Cambridge said Gove was living in a parallel universe in which he bulldozed through reforms to qualifications and failed to recognise the importance of learning itself, including the role of new digital technologies in the classroom. Stephen Perse equips each secondary-age pupil with an iPad and is working with Apple to publish its own curriculum apps. It is also contemplating abandoning handwriting in favour of screen-only working. Kelleher rejected Gove&apos;s recent ridiculing of the use of popular cultural references, such as Mr Men and Disney, as learning tools: &quot;Why not, if they contribute to understanding and learning?&quot; She said modern pupils had a hugely varied cultural landscape. &quot;I think the sober study of classic literature and dry narrative history do not register highly. Young people need an approach which connects with them and the values in their world.&quot; Kelleher&apos;s criticisms come just days after the headmaster of Eton college, Tony Little, warned that a relentless focus on exams and assessment targets in schools risks turning teachers into &quot;functionaries in a service industry&quot;. He had never seen a generation of teachers who defined &quot;their purpose as teachers in such a limited way&quot;. Calls from the private sector \u2013 unbound by the national curriculum and other restrictions affecting state-sector colleagues \u2013 for less central intervention and greater trust in teachers&apos; professionalism come against a backdrop of continuing, far-reaching educational reform. Gove is pushing through a programme combining structural change \u2013 creating academies and free schools \u2013 sweeping qualification reform and revision of the national curriculum. Focus on the UK&apos;s education performance was renewed last week as the latest Programme for International Student Achievement (Pisa), published by the OECD, showed Britain languishing mid-table in reading, maths and science tests taken by 15-year-olds. The league table, whose UK results reflect the performance of children educated mainly under the last Labour government, was topped by east Asian countries, including China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. Kelleher, whose school recorded the joint top score worldwide in the international baccalaureate diploma in the Sunday Times table published last month, urged Gove not to narrow education goals to the pursuit of Pisa scores: &quot;My worry is we are now going to be driven towards Pisa because Pisa becomes the next altar we worship at. But it is really a cul-de-sac in learning terms.&quot; She said Pisa took no account of individual countries&apos; cultural differences, including the unrelenting pressure on pupils in top-performing countries, nor did they recognise the creativity of British learning. &quot;If Michael Gove is saying we should just value what is in Pisa, then we might as well just collapse the curriculum and teach what will come top.&quot; Acknowledging the privileged position of her \u00a35,000-a-term selective school, many of whose pupils are the children of Cambridge academics, Kelleher insisted that an approach focusing on sparking the imaginations of children applied across the schools landscape. In a recent personal blogpost \u2013 she also blogs for the Guardian \u2013 Kelleher cited her own experience as a 13-year-old, when a BBC mini-series of War and Peace inspired her to read Tolstoy&apos;s epic work, awakening a life-long love of history. &quot;I am sure Gove would approve of such cultural aspiration from a working-class daughter of Irish immigrants, yet I should never have even considered reading such a vast tome without the stimulus of the TV series,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Just as the medium of television opened up the world of Tolstoy to me, today television is just one of a multitude of possibilities for engaging the young.&quot; Gove&apos;s dismissal of &quot;low-brow&quot; cultural references missed the point, she argued. &quot;The digital world is a game-changer, and we must change with it. If Angry Birds, the staple digital game of many youngsters, inspires a young person to learn coding, surely that is a desirable outcome? &quot;If the GarageBand app provides a creative platform for an aspiring young musician, isn&apos;t this to be applauded? We are on the nursery slopes of digital learning. The potential for transformation of the conventional educational paradigm is extraordinary. Yet none of this registers in the world of the secretary of state for education. It strikes me that Gove&apos;s well-meaning attempt to promote excellence for all young people is being enacted in a parallel universe.&quot; Angry Birds had not featured on her curriculum, Kelleher said, though pupils were queuing up to learn computer coding in other ways. But music teaching included the use of GarageBand to enable non-musicians to arrange music. The school also encouraged pupils to submit some homework as films, and teachers gave some feedback via audio rather than writing, while geography course materials were all screen-based. Handwriting would be maintained while exam boards continued to require it, but its use would be reassessed if that changed. Kelleher added her voice to concerns over the revised history curriculum, which will focus on a chronological account of Britain&apos;s &quot;island story&quot;. &quot;Imagine if you taught children history without Mandela, for example. Of course we should understand what happened in this country, because it is part of the cultural core that brings us together, but not to be looking around the world is just foolhardy. Our children are global citizens. &quot;Michael Gove is looking back to the past: he is hitting the rewind button because he says that is raising standards. But it should be about improving learning.&quot; A Department for Education spokesperson said: &quot;The simple fact is our education system is not keeping up with the rest of the world. Our reforms will reverse this situation and give our young people the best chance of success. &quot;Through academies and free schools we are giving thousands of brilliant heads and teachers the freedom to innovate on their curriculums and teach in more creative ways than ever to inspire their pupils. &quot;We are reforming teacher training to attract the brightest, most innovative graduates, ending grade inflation and introducing demanding qualifications which match the world&apos;s best.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/20/blackberry-record-net-loss-foxconn-partnership", "publicationDate": "2013-12-20T15:44:34Z", "tags": ["BlackBerry corporation", "Technology", "BlackBerry", "Foxconn", "Business", "Technology sector", "World news"], "sentences": ["The company announced a five-year partnership with Taiwan&apos;s Foxconn, which already makes products for Apple and Microsoft, that will see it jointly develop and manufacture smartphones for the Canadian company, effectively taking over manufacturing operations and much of the risk of being left with unsold inventory."], "title": "Blackberry posts record $4.4bn quarterly net loss", "article": "BlackBerry&apos;s new chief executive John Chen signalled a new strategy focusing on providing secure email and device management to large businesses as the company plunged to a quarterly net loss of $4.4bn, on revenues down 56% to just $1.2bn. The huge loss, driven partly by enormous writedowns on existing inventory, is the largest in the company&apos;s history \u2013 but Chen insisted that the company is &quot;very much alive&quot; as he tries to shift it away from making handsets. The company announced a five-year partnership with Taiwan&apos;s Foxconn, which already makes products for Apple and Microsoft, that will see it jointly develop and manufacture smartphones for the Canadian company, effectively taking over manufacturing operations and much of the risk of being left with unsold inventory. BlackBerry shipped just 1.9m handsets during the quarter, but customers bought a total of 4.3m handsets from outlets \u2013 of which 3.2m were the ageing BB7 model. Since its launch in January, only 4.6m BB10 handsets have been sold, making up less than half of total sales. BlackBerry stock began falling as markets digested the news, which was released ahead of their opening. Chen, who only took over 45 days ago following a radical boardroom shakeup that ousted previous chief Thorsten Heins, acknowledged that the company has lost money on its handset business as part of the business&apos;s degradation over the past two years. Competition from Apple and Samsung has squeezed it from a commanding position in the consumer market back to its origins as a provider of secure email and communications for large &quot;enterprise&quot; businesses. &quot;The most immediate challenge for the company is how to transition the devices operations to a more profitable business model,&quot; said Chen, who formerly managed a turnaround at the software company Sybase. But Chen said that more than 80% of BlackBerry&apos;s existing subscriber base are enterprise customers, which could provide a platform for future business selling &quot;mobile device management&quot; (MDM) services for Apple and Android devices as well as BlackBerrys. Analysts expressed some doubts about the move to Foxconn. Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners, told Associated Press that allowing BlackBerry to be made in China could pose a problem for a company that relies on governments for a lot of its business. &quot;It opens up some security concerns. If you are a government agency with national security data running through your phones, do you have concerns now that they are made by Foxconn?&quot; Gillis wondered."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/21/first-48-tv-show-police-racism-entertainment", "publicationDate": "2013-12-21T12:30:00Z", "tags": ["US crime", "Reality TV", "US news", "World news", "Entertainment", "Race issues", "US television"], "sentences": ["Last month, Taiwan Smart sued the city of Miami for false arrest, false imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights and constitutional violations."], "title": "Reality TV show The First 48 thrives off America's racist justice system | Hannah Harris Green", "article": "The First 48 is an A&amp;E true crime reality show that documents real police investigations for the first 48 hours after a homicide report, including what happens inside interrogation rooms. If this sounds dangerous and ethically questionable, that&apos;s because it is. Police accidentally killed a child as A&amp;E&apos;s cameras rolled, and a legally innocent man came to be known as a murderer after of his appearance on the show. Catastrophes like these have led to lawsuits, and now many cities refuse to work with The First 48.  Even so, the show has become increasingly popular over the duration of its 13-season run. The most recent complete season had 47 episodes, more than any previous season with more planned for 2014, and A&amp;E has also added a companion show, After the First 48. The First 48 shares its voyeurism and bloodlust with other reality shows, but differs from them in that it has destroyed, and even ended, the lives of people who never agreed to be involved. Another distinct feature of the show is that almost all of the suspects in it are black. Portrayals of non-black criminals are so rare that it&apos;s become something of a social media joke. One user (who has since deleted it) tweeted:   My liver is so black it just claimed self-defense on the First 48.     Watching first 48 and realized. ..its always black people on here being killed or killing. Its like they made this to exploit our ignorance&mdash; KING K (@KINGK_80) December 5, 2013    This portrayal is not representative of American crime statistics. Although homicide arrests are disproportionately high among African Americans, about the same total number of white people are arrested in homicide cases as black people. The First 48&apos;s overemphasis on black crime is symptomatic of a larger disrespect for African American communities, which many Americans deem inherently suspicious. The First 48 wouldn&apos;t be as cinematic it is if it didn&apos;t routinely disregard the rights and safety of its subjects. The most shocking instance of disregard was the death of seven-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones in 2010. Detroit police officer Joseph Weekley shot Aiyana in the head after throwing a &quot;flash-bang&quot; grenade, a diversionary and disorientating tool, through her family&apos;s window. Experts on crime in Detroit, including police officers and criminal defense attorneys, suspect Weekley used the evidently dangerous &quot;flash-bang&quot; for cinematic effect, saying that they had never heard of police using the device in this way. The Washington Post reported that Thomas Lobe, an attorney specializing in police misconduct suits, said:  I am absolutely convinced that, when police officers go on search-warrant raids with a film crew tagging along, officers think more about making good television rather than executing a search warrant with concern about the safety of officers and citizens.   Weekley claimed that he shot his gun by accident amidst the confusion the grenade caused. Even if this is true, the details of the case point to gross negligence. The police even attacked the wrong apartment \u2013 the suspect they were after actually lived in the apartment above Aiyana and her family. In September, jurors failed to come to a verdict on involuntary manslaughter charges against Weekley, and the judge declared a mistrial. The Huffington Post reported that his retrial is scheduled for this month.  The show has also been accused of encouraging police to speed up investigations in order to fit the 48-hour narrative, thus hurriedly condemning suspects who would have otherwise received more scrutiny. Last month, Taiwan Smart sued the city of Miami for false arrest, false imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights and constitutional violations. Smart claims that he called the police after running from the scene where his two friends were murdered. When he and the police agreed to a meeting place, they arrested him, much to his surprise. In court, Smart claimed that his arrest and subsequent 19 months in jail stemmed from the police&apos;s desire to &quot;solve&quot; the double murder &quot;in an expeditious fashion for the television show First 48&quot;. He accused the police of withholding documents about the case.  Even release from jail isn&apos;t necessarily enough to erase the stigma that comes from appearing on the First 48. Tyson Mimms of Louisville, Kentucky sued A&amp;E in 2011 for invasion of privacy and defamation. For over a year, the episode aired repeatedly with an onscreen message saying that Mimms was &quot;awaiting trial&quot;, even though his charges were dismissed due of lack of evidence before the episode first aired.  Mimms also claimed that a field producer tried persistently to get him to sign a release to appear on the show, and aired his interrogation even though he refused to sign. The episode in question, &quot;Eye for an Eye \u2013 Dead End&quot;, shows Mimms adamantly professing his lack of knowledge about the murder investigation, and subsequently being arrested. Immediately afterward, the investigating officer says that he is happy to &quot;close the door&quot; on the case. Mimms&apos; lawyer said that because of this appearance, Mimms&apos; community has come to regard him as a murderer. Investigators who appear on the First 48 consistently imply that they have found their murderer at the end of each episode, even though every suspect is legally innocent until proven guilty. An appearance on the First 48 may not mean a prison sentence, but it can still make for a lifetime of social stigma. Mimms was shot to death last year, along with the mother of his child. The full circumstances surrounding their deaths are still unknown.  All of these incidents reek of the same disregard for African Americans&apos; legal rights and safety that characterize many recent controversies, including the stop-and-frisk program, Trayvon Martin&apos;s death and George Zimmerman&apos;s acquittal, as well as the deaths of Renisha McBride, 19, who was shot to death by a white Detroit homeowner last month, and Jonathan Ferrell, 24, who was killed by police in North Carolina in September.  Both McBride and Ferrell were killed because they tried to ask for help \u2013 knocking on homeowners&apos; doors after being involved in car accidents. These tragedies wouldn&apos;t happen if Americans weren&apos;t too quick to assume that African Americans are guilty and dangerous, and if they didn&apos;t use this assumption in order to justify violations of African Americans&apos; rights, including the right to life.  The First 48 thrives off of and perpetuates this systematic injustice by compromising the freedom of Americans for the sake of cheap entertainment."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/23/bae-systems-contract-south-korea-f16-texas", "publicationDate": "2013-12-23T18:44:27Z", "tags": ["BAE Systems", "Business", "US news", "South Korea", "Arms trade", "Defence policy"], "sentences": ["As well as being one of the main combat jets of the US airforce, the F16 is used by more than two dozen other countries, including Belgium, Taiwan, Iraq, Israel and Venezuela."], "title": "BAE Systems secures $1bn contract to upgrade South Korean fighter jets", "article": "  BAE Systems has secured a $1bn (\u00a3611m) contract to upgrade South Korea&apos;s fleet of F16 fighter jets, in a fillip for the UK arms manufacturer after it lost out on a much more lucrative deal with the United Arab Emirates. However, there will be no direct benefit for BAE workers in Britain, where the company employs 34,000 people. BAE said it would hire 300 people at its plant in Fort Worth, Texas, to install new cockpit electronics systems, after getting the green light from Korea and the United States government, which licenses the sale of the aircraft. The deal is a coup for BAE, which beat the F16&apos;s manufacturer, US defence group Lockheed Martin, for the contract to upgrade the planes, provide training and logistical support. It was also welcome news for BAE after the collapse of a \u00a36bn\u00a0deal to provide fighter planes to the\u00a0UAE, and the decision to end shipbuilding in Portsmouth last month. Despite BAE&apos;s UK activities grabbing headlines recently, the\u00a0US remains the group&apos;s largest market. BAE will be upgrading computers, displays, sensors and weapons on South Korea&apos;s 130-strong fleet of F16s, an aircraft built in the US in 1976 that has been involved in numerous conflicts, from sorties in the first Gulf war to enforcing the no-fly zone in Libya. A BAE spokeswoman declined to confirm the value of the contract, but the company has not denied South Korean media reports that the deal is worth $1.1 bn (\u00a3670m). The first phase of the work, on design and development, is worth \u00a3200m, according to the US Defence Security Cooperation Agency. &quot;For us it is pretty strategically important, because the aircraft providers\u00a0usually get the contract for maintenance of the aircraft,&quot; the spokeswoman said. The company now hopes to strike similar deals in continental Europe and Asia. BAE said a number of countries had expressed interest, but declined to give further details. As well as being one of the main combat jets of the US airforce, the F16 is used by more than two dozen other countries, including Belgium, Taiwan, Iraq, Israel and Venezuela. BAE&apos;s share price rose 1.8% on Monday to 429.7 pence, not enough to recoup Friday&apos;s losses when the stock dropped almost 4% on news of the failed UAE deal. The company is striving to bolster an order book that has been depleted by defence cutbacks in the US and the UK, its two largest markets. Such was the importance of a UAE deal, BAE&apos;s chief executive, Ian King, said an agreement would be a &quot;major game changer&quot; for the company. The UK arms manufacturer revealed after the market closed on Thursday that more than a year of talks to supply 60 Typhoon aircraft to the UAE had failed, despite two visits from prime minister David Cameron. The prime minister was left embarrassed after the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, opted for a rival fighter jet produced by France&apos;s Dassault Syst\u00e8mes. The F16 also made headlines recently when US aerospace group Boeing revealed it had retrofitted retired F16s, so they could fly without a pilot."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/24/holden-people-life-beyond-the-factory", "publicationDate": "2013-12-24T05:47:07Z", "tags": ["Holden", "Australia news", "Business"], "sentences": ["You say to international visitors, \u2018this is what we do over here\u2019, but at the end of the day, most of our stuff is now marked with made in China, or Taiwan or whatever.\u201d     Mark Nicholls Photograph: Chris Hopkins/The Guardian    Mark Nicholls, Holden worker, Victoria \u201cHolden has paid for a lot of our families to be educated, it\u2019s paid for our homes, it has been a family."], "title": "Holden people: life beyond the factory", "article": "Chloe Fennell, fuel pump technician and Holden enthusiast, South Australia \u201cMy friend\u2019s dad works at Holden and a couple of other people I know have been there over the years.

Say a husband works at Holden and his wife works in the hospital. When Holden shuts they will have just one income. This means they have to cut all their expenses, and, for example, buy less clothes for children. The clothing stores lose money. The textile guys suffers.

I\u2019ll probably take a good holiday in 2017. I\u2019ve been there 25 years now but I\u2019m concerned because I don\u2019t think I\u2019m over the hill just yet. I\u2019m not even 50 and there aren\u2019t many industries that require the same skills. There will be a big rush of 20,000 people looking for a job at once. It\u2019ll all come down to whether employers like the look of you or not.\u201d     Michael Claridge Photograph: Russell Millard/The Guardian    Michael Claridge, car retailer, South Australia \u201cThe complexities involved in this whole issue are enormous. I don\u2019t think anyone understands what it takes to build a car. It\u2019s a very complex business and the supply lines are enormous. \u201cThe effect this will have on the SA economy is my overriding concern. There\u2019s no doubt that the flow-on effects through to suppliers will be profound. As a state we\u2019ve got some challenges ahead of us. \u201cThe Holden brand will remain, it just that vehicles will be sourced from all over the world. The product line will remain, along with its servicing and parts supply.

Combined monthly revenue from Xiaomi&apos;s MIUI app store, mobile theme store, and other related stores has passed RMB 30 mln. Hong Feng, co-founder and VP of Xiaomi, has stated that MIUI users grew from 20 mln to 30 mln in just the past five months. According to Hong, MIUI currently supports 23 languages and is compatible with nearly 200 handset models. The MIUI ecosystem includes a handset theme store, app store, game center, browser, Duokan Reader, online video, music, and Xiaomi hardware store.  In a few months, Xiaomi will probably have more users than BlackBerry.  August 2010: Gartner says Android to become No.2 worldwide mobile operating system in 2010 and challenge Symbian for No.1 position by 2014 &gt;&gt; Gartner Via the Internet Archive:   Gartner predicts that by 2014, open-source platforms will continue to dominate more than 60% of the market for smartphones. Single-source platforms, such as Apple&apos;s iOS and Research In Motion&apos;s OS, will increase in unit terms, but their growth rate will be below market average and not enough to sustain share increase. Windows Phone will be relegated to sixth place behind MeeGo in Gartner&apos;s worldwide OS ranking by 2014.  The interesting part is not that Gartner got it wrong (predictions are hard; Symbian was still riding high at the time, though just months from being dumped by Nokia&apos;s to-be-hired chief executive), but why it got it wrong. Were handset makers&apos; and carriers&apos; plans - so hard to perceive? And in that case, what else might be brewing?

Film-based models will account for 70.4% of China makers&apos; smartphone touch panel shipments and 44.4% of the tablet touch segment, while the corresponding proportions for glass-based models will be 21.0% and 54.6%. Resistive touch will have 8.6% and 1% of the shipments to the smartphone and tablet sregments respecitvely, Digitimes Research indicated.  From which we conclude that (1) touch-based notebooks aren&apos;t expected to take off much, even if they are quadrupling shipments (2) there are still some tablets with resistive screens. Why the PC will not die &gt;&gt; Newsweek, May 1999 Note the date: this was May 31 1999. Here&apos;s Bill Gates:   But what really sets the PC apart is the incredible empowerment and flexibility it offers in a single, economical package. Sitting at your PC, you can do your taxes, surf the Web, write letters, e-mail friends, play games, plan a business, buy a car, do your homework... in fact, do whatever you want. The PC has given the average American the kind of computing power that 10 years ago was found only in large corporations. Yet people now take this for granted -- and want more. They want to do many of the things they can do on their PC regardless of where they are or what device they are using -- whether it&apos;s a palm-size computer, a Web-enabled cell phone, an Auto PC or a smart television like WebTV. A combination of sophisticated software, powerful microprocessors, wireless technology and high-bandwidth connectivity is starting to make that a reality. For most people at home and at work, the PC will remain the primary computing tool; you&apos;ll still want a big screen and a keyboard to balance your investment portfolio, write a letter to Aunt Agnes, view complex Web pages, and you&apos;ll need plenty of local processing power for graphics, games and so on. But the PC will also work in tandem with other cool devices.  You could replace &quot;PC&quot; with &quot;tablet&quot; or &quot;smartphone&quot; in the first two paragraphs; and arguably for parts of the third. Gates was right, as ever, but much too early. And it hasn&apos;t been Microsoft which has implemented so many of these &quot;cool devices&quot;. HTC says German injunction will not impact One series sales &gt;&gt; Focus Taiwan  HTC, in response to the German court&apos;s ruling, said eight of its nine Android mobile phones were found to have infringed upon Nokia&apos;s patent, with the HTC One and its variants - the One mini and One Max - being found not to have infringed on the patent claimed by Nokia. &quot;This means that HTC will continue to supply our customers with our entire line of flagship devices. We will still be seeking to revoke Nokia&apos;s EP&apos;071 patent in our pending nullity action in Germany, as we believe it to be invalid,&quot; the Taoyuan-based company said in an emailed reply to China News Agency.  The &quot;entire line of flagship devices&quot; being the HTC One, HTC One Max and HTC One mini.

Elections loom large \u2013 in rising economies, in the US with midterms, and also in Europe, with the parliamentary elections in May. Negotiations in the Middle East will prove critical, China will be deciding how to exert its power \u2013 and sport may transform the fortunes of Russia, Brazil and Yorkshire. The US For much of Washington, 2014 cannot come soon enough. November&apos;s mid-term elections represent Barack Obama&apos;s last hope of redrawing the US political map and moving on from a year marred by divided government and Congressional stalemate.     US Capitol Hill. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty)    Whether Democrats succeed in their unlikely dream of seizing back control of the House of Representatives or Republicans instead continue to make inroads on their fragile lead in the Senate is another matter, and much depends on whether the White House can first restore public faith in its flagship healthcare reforms by the 31 March enrolment deadline. Spring will also see Republican leaders under renewed pressure from their Tea Party wing, which is preparing primary challenges against moderates in the Senate that will further constrain any ability to cut deals with Democrats once election fever starts. Several potential bright spots could lift everyone&apos;s spirits, however. A recovering economy may take pressure off America&apos;s anaemic job market and shocking social stagnation. US troops should return from Afghanistan \u2013 with or without a deal in Kabul to retain a security presence. And progress toward Iranian nuclear detente may give the White House cause to celebrate a rare foreign policy success, even if Congress will still need persuading. Other challenges looming in 2014 have been postponed by the dysfunction and inertia of 2013. Barack Obama still needs to decide whether to authorise the Keystone energy pipeline, which pits environmentalists against North America&apos;s unconventional oil boom; expect tough new climate change controls for power companies instead if he does. And with all three branches of government now proposing reform of the NSA, Obama will finally have to decide before January&apos;s state of the union address what to do about America&apos;s surveillance state. For much of 2014, the US Capitol dome will be shrouded in scaffolding for renovations \u2013 both real and metaphorical. What emerges next December will say much about the future of American democracy. Dan Roberts in Washington Europe     May's elections could be the most momentous yet for the European parliament. Photograph: Martin Argles for the Guardian    In the wake of years of crisis that have shaken Europe to the core and raised existential questions, 2014 will bring a major shake-up in the political forces ascendant across the EU, in the people running things, in how the EU&apos;s rival institutions cope with and against one another. Elections for the European parliament in May promise to be the most momentous ever held for the Strasbourg chamber. The angst of the elites across the continent is that the chamber will be captured by a motley crew of Europhobes dedicated to the destruction or subversion of the institution they have conquered. As a result of years of austerity, soaring unemployment and the &quot;renationalisation&quot; of European politics, anti-EU populists will do well in the elections, from Britain to Greece. France could be the big one, with Marine Le Pen&apos;s Front National tipped to win the election nationally. The mavericks and populists will not win the election. But they could secure symbolic victories, take around 30% of seats, shape the agenda, cause the mainstream parties to trim their policies towards the far-right, and benefit from the perceived failings of lacklustre leadership among the mainstream in Europe. The fallout from the elections will also affect the next bout of horse-trading. October will see the appointment of a new European Commission, a new president of the European Council chairing EU summits and mediating between national leaders, and a new foreign policy chief. There will be a battle between the new parliament and national leaders over who should make these key appointments and there will be the usual multi-dimensional scrapping over the plum jobs. While these games preoccupy Brussels, Europe&apos;s real world is one of deepening social and economic impact from years of austerity and euro crisis, of the political costs of minimal growth, effective deflation, mass unemployment. The British question will move up the agenda. Will the UK be the first country, and a big one, to quit the EU? This will concentrate continental minds. Angela Merkel in Berlin, in the first year of her third term as German chancellor, is Europe&apos;s undisputed leader. The year should show if she really has an idea of what she wants her European legacy to be and whether she can get there. France&apos;s President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande cuts an increasingly sorry figure on the European stage \u2013 he needs a new deal with Germany but there is little sign of that happening. French weakness and Italian messiness will reinforce the prevalent sense of worry about European decline. Ian Traynor in Brussels Afghanistan     The last western troops will leave Afghanistan in 2014.  Photograph: Sean Clee    Diplomats and politicians are fond of throwing around the word &quot;decisive&quot; but 2014 really will be a critical year for Afghanistan, one that is expected to determine whether it can avoid another bout of vicious civil war, and hold on to the clear, if limited, gains of the last decade. A presidential election is set for April, which the incumbent, Hamid Karzai, is barred from contesting. There are widespread fears about security and fraud, but if the vote is even a qualified success it will pave the way for the first peaceful democratic transfer of power the country has ever seen. The eleven candidates fighting for a berth in the imposing Arg palace, all of them male, range from a relative of the ousted royal family and one of Karzai&apos;s brothers to the former ministers of defence and foreign affairs and a flamboyant ex-pilot. Once the vote is over, Afghanistan will gear up for another huge change: after 13 years of fighting, the last western combat troops will leave the country. Karzai is currently mulling whether or not to sign a long-term security pact with the US that would keep some foreign soldiers on as mentors to the Afghan army and police, and provide bases for special forces and drones to chase al-Qaida and linked groups along the Pakistani border. Without the deal, not only will all foreign military support be taken away, but $8bn (\u00a34.85bn) a year in promised funding for the military and development projects is also expected to evaporate. That would leave a weak central government facing the Taliban alone, and with almost no cash to pay its soldiers&apos; salaries. The Iraqi foreign minister, whose government turned down a similar deal with the US two years ago, visited Afghanistan in December and warned Afghans that despite its oil wealth his country still needs continued US support. Emma Graham-Harrison in Kabul South Asia     Narendra Modi, leader of the Hindu opposition, will take on the ruling Congress party in general elections. Photograph: Ajit Solanki/AP    No one doubts that 2014 will be another year of dramatic change in south Asia. Economies in India and its neighbours are struggling to create growth and jobs to satisfy hundreds of millions of young people. In Bangladesh, whatever the result of polls in January, the battle between Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia will continue to paralyse politics \u2013 and could hinder efforts to better conditions for workers in the country&apos;s vast garment industry. In India, a general election in May \u2013 the biggest democratic exercise in history \u2013 will pit an ailing Congress party (led by the scion of the Gandhi-Nehru dynasty) against the Hindu nationalist opposition, whose candidate is the controversial Narendra Modi. There have been upsets before but all the indications are that the Congress party is in trouble. There is a huge list of outstanding issues \u2013 from major structural economic weaknesses to violence against women \u2013 to be dealt with by whoever gains power in May. That task may be complicated by the aftermath of the US and Nato pull-out from Afghanistan. All that country&apos;s neighbours have a stake in the aftemath and will do whatever they need to protect their interests. In disputed Kashmir, 2013 saw an increase in clashes along the de facto border splitting the former kingdom between India and Pakistan. Violence is likely to worsen this coming year. There is likely to be trouble elsewhere in the mountains too, as Nepal tries yet again to find some kind of political stability. Down in the Indian Ocean, President Mahinda Rajapaksa will seek to further bolster his hold on power and his popularity in Sri Lanka. Many in the Maldives will simply want calm. By the end of 2014, there will be plenty of others across this region who will share that wish. Jason Burke in Delhi Russia/former Soviet Union     The Sochi Games will be Russia's first challenge of the year. Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters    The Sochi Olympics will open the year for Russia, with President Vladimir Putin&apos;s long-standing pet project finally coming to fruition. If Sochi can pull them off without a terrorist attack, infrastructure collapse, or the arrest of gay competitors, then they may just go down as a success, despite the colossal financial cost of hosting the games. Politically, we will see whether opposition-minded Muscovites, who gave the firebrand opposition leader Alexei Navalny 27% of the vote in 2013 Moscow mayoral elections, can bloody Putin&apos;s nose at local parliamentary elections scheduled for the autumn. One to watch is the recently freed former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Will he stay abroad or return to Russia, and could he decide to enter politics, providing a new and possibly unifying face for the Russian opposition movement? It will be a fascinating year for Ukraine, with half the country up in arms over the decision to turn away from the EU and towards Russia. How much the Kremlin&apos;s cash bolsters the country&apos;s faltering economy, the mood of the powerful oligarchs, and how shrewd a game the opposition politicians play will all be key in determining whether President Viktor Yanukovych can survive until the 2015 elections and even be re-elected. Keep an eye on Uzbekistan, where an epic battle between clans and even within the ruling family is going on, as the 75-year-old dictator Islam Karimov appears to be in fading health. With elections due in 2015 and Karimov not getting any younger, the behind-the-scenes battle is likely to intensify, not least among his two squabbling daughters, both of whom have been tipped for power. Shaun Walker in Moscow Africa     South Sudan and Central African Republic will dominate UN peacekeeping efforts. Photograph: Anna Adhikari/AFP/Getty Images    The regional powerhouses Algeria, Egypt and South Africa will hold elections in a year when polls will also take place in Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, the Comoros, Guinea Bissau and Malawi. In South Africa, the ruling ANC may hope for a boost by reflected glory after the death of the anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela in December, but the mourning period also brought into sharp focus the simmering discontent under the current president, Jacob Zuma \u2013 who was booed at Mandela&apos;s memorial service. A generation of &quot;born frees&quot; \u2013 those born after democracy in 1994 \u2013 will be voting for the first time. In Malawi, President Joyce Banda&apos;s reforms will also be tested in May&apos;s general elections. Banda has won acclaim in the west for bolstering the economy of this aid-dependent, impoverished country. But she faces accusations of being an International Monetary Fund stooge back home, where moves such as an IMF-backed devaluation of the kwacha currency have stoked inflation and sent food prices soaring for the rural poor. A showdown between Kenya and the international criminal court looms, as President Uhuru Kenyatta faces trial in November for allegedly orchestrating violence during the 2007 presidential election that killed more than 1,100 people. Kenyatta has accused the court of disproportionately targeting African leaders. With crises deepening in Central African Republic and South Sudan, 2014 will provide a stern test for peacemakers, among them French government troops and UN blue helmets. April sees the 20th anniversaries of both the Rwandan genocide and South Africa&apos;s first democratic election. In at least one corner of Zimbabwe, there will be celebrations as Robert Mugabe turns 90 in February. The long-time ruler knows how to throw a party: last year, fans were invited to cut a 90kg four-tier cake, while 8,000 lobsters were dished up and gold coins were specially minted. The celebrations reportedly cost \u00a3400,000. Expect more of the same. Monica Mark in Lagos Middle East      What can change the course of the chaos in Syria? Photograph: Saad Abobrahim/Reuters    If ever there were a year in the Middle East in which negotiations matter, 2014 will be it. In all corners of the region, hopes of negotiated solutions to grave and escalating crises are higher than ever. So too are the stakes if they fail. At centre stage will be Iran, which clearly feels legitimised by the recent deal that allows it to continue its nuclear programme, under close supervision, while crippling economic sanctions are progressively eased. But the deal could easily unravel, either through the influence of deeply wary US legislators, downright hostile Saudi leaders, or belligerent Israeli decision-makers, none of whom are happy with sanctions relief while centrifuges continue to spin. Iran hopes to parlay the deal into a broader role in solving the region&apos;s myriad problems; first among them Syria, which is almost as important to its strategic interests as its nuclear reactors. The civil uprising against Bashar al-Assad is now a convoluted mess of vested interests, from both near and far. Jihadist groups have arrived in the vacuum and are particularly strong in the north and east of the country where they, along with crumbling state control, pose a serious threat to the unitary borders of Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. And, if the Kurds decide chaos creates for them a moment in history, Turkey faces a challenge to its defined borders too. The chaos that is Syria has yielded a common foe: jihadists who have nothing to do with the original insurrection. Assad is pinning hopes on that being enough for the US and Europe to join with his forces and the remnants of the Free Syria Army to oust them instead of him. That would protect Iranian and Russian interests, but further upset Saudi Arabia and the Sunni Arab Gulf, which, along with Israel, fears the creep of Iranian influence perhaps more than anything else. Meanwhile, spring 2014 is also the deadline for the US-sponsored Israeli-Palestinian talks to reach a deal to end their historic conflict. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, may present a framework agreement early in the new year in effort to break the impasse that has existed for many months. That will put both sides on the spot, forcing them to confront possible compromises \u2013 and it could cause a crisis for Israel&apos;s coalition government. But there&apos;s still no guarantee that it will produce a deal. Without a breakthrough, Israel faces the possibility of accelerating moves by the international community, especially the European Union, against settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and increasing political isolation. The Palestinians might resume efforts to join global bodies such as the international criminal court, at which they will pursue their quest for a state. Conditions in Gaza may worsen further for its 1.7 million inhabitants. Frustration and anger there and in the West Bank could erupt in a return to violence. On all fronts, resolutions are urgently needed. A fraught year ahead. Martin Chulov and Harriet Sherwood China     Xi Jinping is hoping to bring 'national rejuvenation' to China. Photograph: Lan Hongguang/Xinhua Press/Corbis    As President Xi Jinping continues to pursue his much-vaunted &quot;Chinese dream&quot; of &quot;national rejuvenation&quot;, China will continue to assert its territorial claims in disputed parts of the South and East China seas. Its strategy of slow, stepwise expansion has angered many of its neighbors, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, even Brunei. No one has shown any sign that they will back down. The chances of armed military conflict seem high. Other buzzwords in China will be growth and reform. On 15 November, the country&apos;s top leaders \u2013 many of them only a year into their posts \u2013 announced a dramatic reform agenda, and over the coming year they&apos;ll prove whether they can deliver on their promises. They&apos;ve pledged to relax the country&apos;s one-child policy, allowing couples to have a second child if either parent is an only child; they plan to boost the private sector&apos;s role in the state-controlled economy, hoping to improve conditions for a burgeoning middle class. Beijing will host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) Summit in 2014; the southern city Nanjing will host the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics. The Communist party will address many of its greatest issues, but only on its own terms. Xi will continue to crack down on corruption, modernize the People&apos;s Liberation Army, and keep the national GDP growing at a steady clip. He will tighten the reins on freedom of expression and dissent, as protests over land-grabs, inequality and environmental decay proliferate. Expect progressive legislation without implementation; do not expect leniency for dissidents or increased autonomy in Xinjiang and Tibet. The great imponderable is North Korea, as critical to China as it is inscrutable. The recent execution of Kim Jong-un&apos;s uncle may prove a harbinger of greater instability, a headache that China could well do without. Jon Kaiman in Beijing South America     Dilma Rousseff, president of Brazil, will tackle a World Cup and a presidential election. Photograph: Jefferson Bernardes/AFP/Getty Images    With a World Cup and a presidential election, Brazil looks set to dominate Latin American headlines in 2014. Currently the odds on Dilma Rousseff securing a second term in October look slightly better than the Sele\u00e7ao winning a sixth trophy in July, but they are both firm favourites. Another round of mass protests or a stadium collapse, however, and all bets in the country could be off. It will be a big year for elections elsewhere in the region with presidential polls in El Salvador, Bolivia, Uruguay, Colombia and Panama. But, as in Brazil, that probably won&apos;t mean much of a changing of the guard unless economies in the region slow down more than they did in 2013, which is a very real possibility. At most risk in this regard is Venezuela&apos;s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has a tough fight against inflation and recession on his hands. He will be glad not to face the electorate in 2014, but his rivals within the ruling camp remain a threat. Arguably the most important of the polls is in Colombia, where the incumbent, Juan Manuel Santos, will be looking for a campaign boost from the peace talks his government is holding with Farc insurgents in Havana. Expect concrete progress before the first round of voting on 25 May or an election upset. The saddest political departure will be that of Jos\u00e9 &quot;Pepe&quot; Mujica, who will be in his last year as Uruguayan president. With his austere lifestyle and solidly pragmatic leftwing leadership, he has given this small country a big global profile. Before he shuffles back to spend more time at his farm, the world will watching the results of his government&apos;s country&apos;s cannabis legalisation law, which comes into effect next year. If that works, it will not only add to Mujica&apos;s legacy, but could provide a new template for other Latin American nations, particularly Mexico, Colombia and Peru, that are suffering a heavy toll in the &quot;war on drugs.&quot; Counterintuitive prediction: a step forward in Cuban-US relations. Ra\u00fal Castro has made some small but significant openings in the past year. Obama has talked of the need for new thinking and a change is long overdue. The question is whether the vehemently anti-Castro Miami crowd can be bypassed, ignored or persuaded that a rapprochement is in everyone&apos;s interests . Jon Watts in Rio Miscellany Expect to learn a great deal about the first world war, as the various anniversary points come and go: the Sarajevo assassination (June), the outbreak of hostilities (August), that Christmas football match. While we&apos;re on the subject of anniversaries, watch for recollections of 1964 (Beatlemania, Mary Poppins, intensification of the Vietnam war), 1989 (fall of the Berlin Wall and the Velvet Revolution) as well as the centenary not just of the Panama Canal but of the birth of Dylan Thomas. Oh, and if that&apos;s not enough memory lane for you, then it&apos;s the 700th anniversary of Bannockburn too. Newsmakers will include Janet Yellen, poised to become the first female chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Vladimir Putin, who takes over leadership of the G8, and the former Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi, whose trial will continue. More recreationally, aside from the Sochi Olympics in February and the World Cup in June, the Tour de France starts in Yorkshire and the Ryder Cup tees off at Gleneagles. And it&apos;s not just 2014.

No, Galaxy Nexus phones won&apos;t be receiving the update for Android 4.4 (KitKat). Why isn&apos;t Galaxy Nexus receiving the update to Android 4.4? Galaxy Nexus, which first launched two years ago, falls outside of the 18-month update window when Google and others traditionally update devices.  &quot;Traditionally&quot;? When did this tradition start, exactly? And is this &quot;18-month update window&quot; well known? &quot;No one at Google is Returning Our Calls&quot; &gt;&gt; Digits to Dollars Jay Greenberg has been talking with Chinese handset OEMs, who want access to &quot;full Google&quot; Android (aka GMA) so they can attack the export market:   it appears that Google has not fully delegated the GMA to the baseband providers, preferring to keep that power firmly rested in Mountain View. And to be fair, it is no easy task for Google to operate in China. That being said, all the OEMs we spoke with said they would be happy to sign agreements in Hong Kong, which after all is just over the border from Shenzhen. The net result of all this is that the small vendors, who collectively ship several hundred million phones a year, have to make do. If you buy a phone on the streets of Shenzhen, even a device with no obvious branding on it, you are probably getting a phone that has access to the full G-Suite. My contacts tell me that &apos;cracked&apos; G-Suite keys are readily available in China. So here we come to the crux of the problem. Android wants to use the Google Suite to control Android as best as they can. But corporate Google just wants billions of people to have ready access to all of Google&apos;s offerings. The compromise in China means cracked software codes, and all the security implications that those likely entail. One OEM told me that he had tried repeatedly to reach out to Google but got no response. I found this story very resonant, as it was exactly what they told me four years ago about Microsoft.

And while it&apos;s impressive how Apple&apos;s &quot;highly modded PC&quot; is able to meet thermal and power requirements in such a tiny size, all of this normally comes at a price, which is traditionally known as the &quot;Apple Tax&quot;. We set out to find out just how much of a &quot;tax&quot; there is this time around by pitting their highest spec&apos;d machine against what we could build with industry standard, off the shelf parts, available today. Here&apos;s what we came up with.  Have a guess at how much cheaper they managed it. 2009: Mum, Daad, grandma, get off Facebook! &gt;&gt; theguardian.com From March 2009:   18-25-year-olds make up a third of Facebook users on their own (hence the prevalence of photos tagged &quot;drunk at PARTY!!&quot;) - but also Facebook is ageing faster than the real population. What does the invasion of Mum, Dad, and the grandparents mean for Facebook? That&apos;s harder to discern. Perhaps more advertising opportunities - because the older generation is more accustomed to react favourably to adverts? Or more potential revenue, because that generation has (or used to have) more money? But the more interesting question is whether this will mean any change in the culture of Facebook.  And you get your answer in 2013, when Facebook is &quot;dead&quot; to teens in Europe. Slow sales of flagship smartphones to affect vendor rankings in 2014 &gt;&gt; Digitimes  LG originally projected to sell 10m units of its Optimus G2 flagship model in 2013, but global sales have so far reached slightly over 2m units, the observers noted. The release of the G2 was too close to the launch of the Nexus 5, which affected sales momentum of LG&apos;s own flagship model, added the sources. Huawei has so far shipped only over 3m units of its latest flagship model, the Ascend P6, lagging far behind its shipment target of 10m units.  Nobody&apos;s putting any numbers on how many HTC Ones have been sold either. HTC executives indicted for leaking trade secrets (update) &gt;&gt; FOCUS TAIWAN  Six employees of leading Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC Corp., including its vice president of product design Thomas Chien, were indicted Friday on charges of leaking trade secrets and breach of trust. Three of HTC&apos;s materials suppliers were also indicted for allegedly helping HTC design executives make false expense claims of over NT$33m (US$1.1m). In its indictment, the Taipei Prosecutors Office said Chien, who has been detained since 31 August, had stolen and leaked key icon designs to his would-be Chinese business partners in Beijing in June. The designs were for HTC&apos;s yet-to-be-unveiled smartphone interface.  Prosecutors are claiming that all but one of the accused has confessed with a maximum jail sentence of 10 years; the report also says that two of them have been &quot;forgiven&quot; by the company. So how valuable were those designs exactly? Hole found in Samsung&apos;s Knox security feature &gt;&gt; SiliconBeat  The hole could allow hackers to intercept email, browser activity and other activity originating from within the Knox environment. &quot;Knox symbolizes state-of-the-art in terms of secure mobile architectures, and I was surprised to find that such a big &apos;hole&apos; exists and was left untouched,&quot; said Mordechai\u00a0Guri, a Ph.D. student in the Cyber Security Labs at Israel&apos;s Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, who discovered the vulnerability. &quot;This weakness has to be addressed immediately, before it falls into the wrong hands.&quot; Knox creates a secure, password-protected virtual space within Samsung devices that&apos;s supposed to allow the devices to connect to similarly secured corporate and government computers and access sensitive files without fear that those files might leak out to the outside world. But thanks to the security hole, a user could install an app in the regular, non-secure area of the phone that could compromise all the phone&apos;s communications, including those made within the Knox container, according to Cyber Security Labs researchers. In addition to exposing sensitive data, the hole could potentially be used to upload malicious files from a compromised phone to corporate or government servers, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Odd that the Pentagon didn&apos;t discover this during its testing of Knox before giving it certification. Samsung edges Apple for #1 ranking in ABI Research&apos;s enterprise smartphone competitive assessment &gt;&gt; ABI Research Note that it&apos;s enterprise, not consumer:   The vendor matrix score separating Samsung and Apple was less than a single point. Apple received extremely high marks in Implementation due to high iOS smartphone adoption by business users and because its smartphones are the most activated device within EMM/MDM platforms. Samsung, on the other hand, was ranked as more Innovative with a wider range of enterprise devices and better security features. Samsung&apos;s higher Innovation scores lead to its number one ranking. The third place ranking for BlackBerry was driven by lower Implementation scores, yet it still received high scores in Innovation. The company faces shrinking smartphone market share in an intense competitive environment. Even so, BlackBerry is still considered the gold standard in enterprise security supported by recent BES enhancements for multi-OS and dual-persona device management.  Notebook vendors still conservative about 2-in-1 devices in 2014 &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Most notebook vendors are still conservative about sales of 2-in-1 notebook/tablet convertible models in 2014 despite the increasing number of 2-in-1 devices. Because most peripherals for 2-in-1 devices such as keyboards are device specific, if the devices see weak sales, peripheral inventories also pile up for the vendors, the sources noted. In 2013, 2-in-1 devices had a less than 10% share in the mobile device market, and most vendors are conservative about demand in 2014 despite Intel&apos;s optimistic forecast of 10-fold growth, the sources pointed out.  A sub-10% share that&apos;s going to increase 10-fold? 2014 should be interesting. (The inventory problem is the killer.) HTC Software Updates &gt;&gt; HTC United States An infographic (you have to click a link) to explain why it&apos;s so hard to update phones. As with any infographic, it doesn&apos;t follow any sensible flow: quite when the provision of &quot;No further OS updates&quot; is triggered isn&apos;t clear at all. Online shopping digital analytics benchmark &gt;&gt; IBM Mobile traffic was up 28.3% year-on-year in the US, and mobile sales were 29% of all purchases - up 40% on 2012:   \u2022 Smartphones browse, tablets buy: Smartphones drove 28.5% of all online traffic compared to tablets at 18.1%, making it the browsing device of choice. When it comes to making the sale, tablets drove 19.4% of all online sales, more than twice that of smartphones, which accounted for 9.3%. Tablet users also averaged $95.61 per order, versus smartphone users, who averaged $85.11 per order. \u2022 iOS vs. Android: As a percentage of total online sales, iOS was more than five times higher than Android, driving 23% vs. 4.6% for Android. On average, iOS users spent $93.94 per order, nearly twice that of Android users, who spent $48.10 per order.\u00a0iOS also led as a component of overall traffic with 32.6% vs. 14.8% for Android. \u2022 The Social Influence - Facebook vs. Pinterest: Shoppers referred from Facebook averaged $72.01 per order, versus Pinterest referrals, which drove $86.83 per order. \u00a0However, Facebook referrals converted sales at nearly four times the rate of Pinterest referrals, perhaps indicating stronger confidence in network recommendations.  At this rate mobile will be the majority next year.

So what is changing? Well, if you are driving in Oregon with children in your car, do not light up. It&apos;ll be illegal. And if you&apos;re driving in Switzerland, turn your headlights on. Even if it&apos;s the middle of the day. While we&apos;re on the subject of lighting, if you live in Canada please remove those last incandescent lightbulbs \u2013 they won&apos;t be allowed any more. Other things that are no being banned: owning unregistered assault weapons in Connecticut; harassing celebrities and their children with long-lens cameras in California; hunting elephants in Botswana and injudicious calls to the London Fire Brigade (if you&apos;re a business you&apos;ll be fined for false alarms). Oh, and if you&apos;re an architect practising in Texas, you will have to get yourself fingerprinted. Don&apos;t ask why. On the other hand, there are moments of great liberalisation to salute. Colorado on Wednesday will become the first state in the US to allow the sale of marijuana for recreational purposes. Also in America, for the first time it will be OK to be a gay Boy Scout, while for their British counterparts, it&apos;s OK to be an atheist. For Germans, liberalisation comes in more subtle ways, such as the new dispensation for universities and libraries, which will henceforth be allowed to upload &quot;orphaned&quot; works of art on to the internet without permission. If you&apos;re Bulgarian or Romanian, welcome. Work restrictions across the EU for citizens of two of the poorest EU countries are lifted. But despite the dire warnings from the right (er, people who are supposed to believe in free markets no less) the indications are that there will be no sudden influx of Balkan builders. In a less-observed border relaxation, it will become much easier for Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan as the Chinese authorities make a concerted effort to improve cross-strait ties. And in the unlikely event that you are off to do some shopping in Latvia, leave your lats at home and take euros instead: the Baltic republic becomes the 18th country to join the single currency zone. Indeed, institutional changes are a 1 January perennial. Russia will run the G8 for a year while Greece gets its turn to lead the EU. Democrat Bill de Blasio takes over as New York mayor.

If you live in France, you can demand your home be checked for electromagnetic waves. If you are arrested, make sure the police address you as &quot;vous&quot; and not &quot;tu&quot;, as they are required to do from 1 January. If you die in Hungary, fear not: from Wednesday the state will reportedly provide a free grave, coffin or urn \u2013 and even a free shovel for gravedigging \u2013 to poorer sections of society. The other thing that 1 January signifies is the start of a year dedicated to an issue or theme. So prepare yourself, and make any necessary adjustments to your schedule, to accommodate the International Year of Family Farming, the International Year of Crystallography and the International Year of Small Island Developing States.
