Xu Shuaijun, a 35-year-old cook from northern China&apos;s Hebei province, departed from coastal Fujian province on Wednesday and flew for nearly seven- and-a-half hours before his balloon hit turbulence and suffered a mechanical breakdown. According to the Japanese coastguard, he crashed about 14 miles (22km) from the uninhabited islands, called the Diaoyu by China and the Senkaku by Japan. Soon afterwards Taiwanese officials received a missing person report and relayed it to the Japanese coastguard, which rescued him by helicopter and handed him over to a Chinese patrol ship. &quot;The Chinese vessel thanked the coastguard via radio for the rescue operation,&quot; according to the Japan Times. China and Japan&apos;s competing claims to the islands stretch back decades, but the dispute has repeatedly veered perilously close to armed conflict since 2012, when the Japanese government purchased the islands from a private owner.     Balloon crash    China has stepped up maritime patrols in the waters surrounding the islands; perceived intrusions into the disputed territory are common and both sides have scrambled fighter jets in response. Diplomatic relations between the world&apos;s second- and third-largest economies have soured further in recent weeks, after China unilaterally declared an air-defence identification zone over a large swath of the East China Sea, essentially laying administrative claim to the airspace over the islands. Last Thursday the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, visited Yasukuni, a controversial shrine in Tokyo honouring the country&apos;s war dead including several former Japanese leaders convicted of war crimes. The visit led Chinese leaders to declare Abe persona non grata and freezing top-level diplomatic ties. Xu is a licensed hot-air balloon pilot who, in 2012, became the first person to fly a balloon over eastern China&apos;s Bohai Bay. His profile picture on Sina Weibo, the country&apos;s most popular microblog site, shows a thin, bespectacled man wearing a grey and blue sweater and a leather jacket. &quot;I&apos;ve returned safely, thank you all for your concern,&quot; Xu posted to his Weibo page on Thursday morning. The post has solicited at least 68 comments, many of them lauding Xu for his patriotism. Xu described his plans in a post in September. &quot;Be a Chinese person with attitude,&quot; he wrote above a picture of a waving Chinese flag. He described his voyage as the &quot;hardest flight in history&quot;, involving -40C temperatures and insufficient oxygen. According to his calculations, his target islet was 223 miles from the Chinese coast and, at only 150 metres wide, just a speck of land in the freezing open water of the East China Sea. Nationalist activists from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan have repeatedly tried to land on the disputed islands in recent years. In August 2012 Japanese coastguards arrested eight Chinese activists who sailed to an island from Hong Kong and planted a flag on its shore. A few days later a small group of Japanese activists swam ashore in retaliation. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 January 2014 to replace an incorrect map reference in an earlier version."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/jan/03/holiday-hotspots-where-to-go-in-2014", "publicationDate": "2014-01-03T21:00:00Z", "tags": ["Summer holidays", "Adventure travel", "Family holidays", "City breaks", "Beach holidays", "Winter sports holidays", "Winter sun", "Europe holidays", "South America holidays", "North and Central America holidays", "Asia", "Australasia holidays", "Travel"], "sentences": ["Taiwan      Yong Kang Street, Taipei, Taiwan.", "Photograph: Justin Guariglia/Corbis    Ever tried gua bao, the Taiwanese dish of pork belly in a steamed bun?", "A Taiwanese street food purveyor called Bao, based in London&apos;s Hackney, is on a mission to bring it to the British masses and has had an exceptional first year, winning accolades from Young British Foodies and the British Street Food Awards (people&apos;s choice award).", "Now the team behind it are hoping to inspire people to travel to Taiwan by launching a food tour, via Opentrips (opentrips.co.uk, five nights from 14 March, \u00a3645pp excluding flights).", "Founder Erchen Chang says her top tip is to visit the city of Tainan in southern Taiwan: &quot;It&apos;s the true capital of street food \u2013 and definitely not made for tourists.&quot; From oyster omelettes in Taipei&apos;s night markets to tea in a Maokong plantation, Taiwan is a fascinating place to eat and drink your way around."], "title": "Holiday hotspots: where to go in 2014", "article": "1. Cape Town, South Africa Following in the footsteps of Helsinki and Seoul, Cape Town has been elected World Design Capital 2014, giving it the opportunity to showcase about 450 innovation projects. That it was selected more as a &quot;one to watch&quot; rather than a fully polished design leader makes it even more exciting to keep an eye on. To see a social/design experiment in action, go to Woodstock, a run-down suburb given a new lease of life through the Neighbourgoods Market), which sells artisan goods in a former biscuit factory: The Old Biscuit Mill. This is also home to Luke Dale-Roberts&apos; restaurants the Test Kitchen and the Pot Luck Club &amp; Gallery. The city has got what is being billed as the world&apos;s coolest cafe \u2013 Truth, drawing on a Victorian steam-punk theme,. For\u00a0a township &quot;jazz safari&quot;, or a tour\u00a0specifically linked to World Design Capital 2014, see coffeebeansroutes.com.     Truth coffee shop, Cape Town.    2. Uz\u00e8s, France Our enduring love affair with France, and with Provence in particular, has been seized upon by Eurostar, which is extending the direct six-hour summer service from Ashford to Avignon by two weeks (28\u00a0June-13 September), with a view to a\u00a0year-round service from 2015. One place sure to please Francophiles is Uz\u00e8s, a short hop west of Avignon in rural Languedoc-Roussillon. The town has Renaissance architecture, mazy streets and nuns selling jam in Place aux Herbes. But a sure sign that Uz\u00e8s is becoming a style outpost is the number of restored houses being run as maisons d&apos;h\u00f4tes. L&apos;Albiousse (from \u20ac155 a night) is a tasteful four-room luxury B&amp;B in a 16th-century house off Place aux Herbes, owned by two former Paris restaurateurs. It is near the Mus\u00e9e du Bonbon, aka the Haribo Museum, as Uz\u00e8s is the production site for Gummi Bears. 3. Austin, Texas, US     Hotel Saint Cecilia. Photograph: Cheri Lucas    Americans are well aware that this is Texas&apos;s coolest city, but a few happenings this year will help put Austin on the map for international travellers, too. British Airways now flies there non-stop from Heathrow five days a week; Terence Malick&apos;s as-yet-untitled new project features the city along with an epic cast (including Ryan Gosling and Natalie Portman); and hoteliers are cottoning on to its appeal: Austin-based healthy eating chain Whole Foods is planning its first health resort, and Mexico&apos;s hip Habita hotel group has its own impending opening. For now, the best places to stay are Hotel Saint Cecilia (doubles from $430, +1 512-852-2400) and Hotel San Jose, its cheaper sister across the street (rooms from $175, +1 512-852-2360). 4. Carmarthenshire, UK The man himself would no doubt have approved. In the seaside town of Laugharne this year, the centenary of Dylan Thomas&apos;s birth, visitors who can prove it is their birthday can claim a free pint in Brown&apos;s Hotel, the very pub where Thomas liked to sit &quot;mouldering&quot; and giving his liver a punishing work-out (dylanthomasbirthdaywalk.co.uk). There will be festivals and events to mark the centenary all year, including a Dylan Thomas Poetry, Biography and Film Weekend in Laugharne, from 2-5 May, with poets including Simon Armitage and John Cooper Clarke performing in venues around town. (For a list of all centenary events see dylanthomas100.org). Brown&apos;s (browns-hotel.co.uk, doubles from \u00a395) has been refurbished in a 1950s retro style that Thomas would probably find familiar, but it is now a boutique hotel, with iPod docks and lovely organic linens in its 14 rooms. And the Dylan Thomas boathouse has fabulous views of the Taf estuary and the Gower beyond. 5. Kolkata, India     Tile mosaic on the Kolkata subway. Photograph: Alamy    Change is stirring in Kolkata. Travellers in 2014 will find the same Hooghly hubbub and ghosts-of-the-Raj atmosphere, but they&apos;ll also find a city on the move. There&apos;s a new airport terminal, a recently opened luxury mall and Kolkata&apos;s first skyscraper, The 42, a development just taller than Canary Wharf, has been dubbed the &quot;cloud-kisser of Chowringhee&quot; after the street it towers over. And Kolkata&apos;s metro system, India&apos;s first when it opened in 1984, is being expanded, eventually creating cross-town links for the first time. New hotel openings also sound a positive note. This month it&apos;s the legendary Great Eastern Hotel, opened in 1840 and hosting luminaries such as Mark Twain before falling into disrepair and eventually closing in 2005. In autumn, The Penthouse boutique hotel, from the Glenburn Tea Estate group, promises a dose of low-key chic. 6. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe Together the neighbouring islands of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe form Africa&apos;s second-smallest nation. But it is shaping up to be one of its premier surf spots. With uncrowded waters surrounded by palm trees and white sands, Radiation Point (Praia de Alg\u00e9s) is often said to offer some of the best breaks on the continent and, in December, the International Surfing Association (ISA) gave the country its official seal of approval by inviting it to become its 78th member. Base yourself at Hotel Praia Inhame (chalets for two from $60), and you can\u00a0also enjoy turtle watching, diving and fishing trips. 7. Ala\u00e7at\u0131, Turkey     Outdoor dining in Alacati. Photograph: Alamy    Ala\u00e7at\u0131, on the Cesme peninsula near Izmir on Turkey&apos;s Aegean coast, was for centuries a Greek settlement within the Ottoman empire. Ancient houses in the town were taken over by Turkish refugees in the 1920s, and city folk from Izmir would spend summers here. Then windsurfers discovered the near-perfect conditions in its bay and a hip Istanbul crowd fell for its cobbled streets and blue-shuttered stone houses. Over the past 10 years, boho-chic hotels, restaurants championing local produce and antiques shops have mushroomed. The latest opening is Alavya (doubles from \u00a3159 B&amp;B with Exclusive Escapes): 25\u00a0bedrooms, two restaurants, a spa and a swimming pool set in a walled garden. Pale rooms are filled with contemporary Turkish art, and there&apos;s a private yacht for guests. There are also plenty of cheaper hotels such as the Tas (doubles from \u00a380 B&amp;B) or the Incirliev (rooms from \u00a360 B&amp;B). In the morning have coffee at K\u00f6se Kahve then browse K\u00f6se Dukkan for gifts and linens, and the art and antiques shops on Hac\u0131 Memis street, stopping for more coffee at Dutlu Kahve (Mulberry Cafe), then a country-style lunch at Asma Yapragi. By day the streets are a treasure trail of strange fruits and vegetables, at night they resemble a vast outdoor cafe or club. Fly to Izmir with easyJet (from April), Pegasus or Turkish Airlines. See explorealacati.com. 8. George Town, Malaysia Once George Town was named a Unesco world heritage site in 2008, the capital of the Malaysian state of Penang began changing into one of south-east Asia&apos;s hottest destinations. Penangites are renovating everything from Chinese mansions to old factories, which means there&apos;s something for all budgets \u2013 delicious street food or fine dining; funky hostels or boutique hotels. The latest spot is the Three Sixty Degree Sky Bar. Follow drinks there with either a\u00a0plate of spicy duck soup from one of the stalls on Kimberley Street or gourmet Penang Nyonya cuisine at Seven Terraces, the restaurant everyone wants to be seen at. In addition to the month-long George Town festival (1-31\u00a0August), this year the city will host the first south-east Asian edition of Tropfest (20-25 January, free), the world&apos;s biggest short film festival. 9. Alberta, Canada     The Glacier Skywalk. Photograph: Scott Rowed    Ontario has Toronto and Niagara; British Columbia has Vancouver and Whistler. Poor old Alberta comes third on UK visitors&apos; lists, according to the Canadian Tourist Commission. But this may well change in 2014, with the opening of the Glacier Skywalk, pictured below, (from 17 May, \u00a315 adults/\u00a37 children) on the Icefields Parkway, between Banff and Jasper. The horseshoe-shaped, glass-floored walkway \u2013 similar to the Grand Canyon Skywalk \u2013 takes visitors 280m above the Sunwapta valley, over crashing waterfalls. The Glacier View Inn has a glacier package (from \u00a384pp for double room and tour). World-class skiing is an hour or two&apos;s drive away: try Lake Louise, named Canada&apos;s best ski resort at the World Ski Awards. For city life try Calgary, which has gone from cowboy town to cosmopolitan cool. 10. Bordeaux, France Like a classic wine, Bordeaux took a bit of time to come into its own. A renewal programme instigated by mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 in the 1990s has transformed Bordeaux from a congested and claustrophobic place into a bright, modern city. Neo-classical facades have had a steam clean, sleek trams snake through the boulevards and the once-desolate riverfront has been redeveloped. The latest splash of colour comes in the form of a fleet of Philippe Starck-designed scooter-bikes, being tested for a cycle share scheme. Starck is also behind the new Mama Shelter, (doubles from \u20ac59) a budget hotel that opened in the former HQ of France&apos;s national gas company last October. In the northern docklands, old warehouses are being recast. Les Tontons (from \u20ac10 for two courses) in the cavernous former dock offices serves up to 500 people a chic take on canteen-style food. Just over the Bacalan Bridge is Le Garage Modern, car repair shop by day and performance venue by night. But everything leads back to wine. The CAPC Mus\u00e9e D&apos;Art Contemporain de Bordeaux is in an old wine warehouse on the harbour, and just five minutes from Wine &amp; Soul (23 rue du Couvent), a cosy cave-like wine bar. 11. Iran     Mosque in Imam Square, Esfahan, Iran. Photograph: Alamy    November&apos;s historic nuclear agreement means there hasn&apos;t been a\u00a0better time for westerners to visit Iran since the 1979 revolution. Although the Foreign Office (FCO) still advises against all but essential travel (because the UK has no embassy there), other countries, including the US and Australia, deem most areas safe. The FCO does say groups are safer than independent visits, and the options are increasing. Wild Frontiers has three group trips to Iran (15 days from \u00a32,705pp), and its website has a guide covering insurance, safety and dress codes. In the first journey of its kind, the Danube Express train will travel across Iran for 15 days in October (from \u00a38,695pp). Despite the high price, demand is such that new dates for 2015 have already been added. Iran&apos;s highlights include Persepolis, Esfahan, Tehran and Shiraz, the Zagros mountains and the Bavanat valley. 12. Belgium The world&apos;s eyes will be on Belgium this year for the centenary of the outbreak of the first world war. The first soldier to be killed in the fighting died in Li\u00e8ge at dawn on 4 August 1914; the first and the last British soldiers to die were both killed in Mons, near the French border. Brussels is staging a major exhibition, 1914-18: It&apos;s our History!, which opens on 7 February at the city&apos;s Royal Army Museum. There are also scores of other commemorative events all over Flanders, the northern part of Belgium: see visitflanders.co.uk for details. Tour operators are running guided trips, too: such as Ramblers Worldwide, which has a Walking the Ypres Salient tour (from \u00a3999, including half-board accommodation and Eurostar travel, which includes the Tyne Cot cemetery, near Ypres. 13. Brazil     A beach on Itaparica island in the Baia de Todos os Santos, Bahia, Brazil. Photograph: Alex Robinson/Getty    Be prepared for Brazil to take over your living room this year: images of Sugarloaf and Cristo will be everywhere in the build-up to the World Cup. But Brazil&apos;s real magic is in the jungles and beaches of its 8,000km coastline. Website Hidden Pousadas Brazil showcases small pousadas, ecolodges and hotels all over the country. In the relatively unexplored north-eastern state of Alagoas, a succession of rustic-chic laid-back beach pousadas offer fabulous cuisine: try Pousada da Amendoeira (bungalows from \u00a3110) on Praia do Toque, or Pousada Casa Zulu (doubles from \u00a346) in Icaraizinho de Amontada. Beaches aside, anyone heading to Manaus for England&apos;s opening match against Italy should make time to explore the world&apos;s greatest tropical rainforest: Pousada Uacari (three nights full-board from $550pp) is a floating lodge in the heart of the jungle. 14. Macedonia Despite a history of winemaking that goes back to Roman times and romantic Mediterranean villages with\u00a0Byzantine churches and terracotta roofs, Macedonia continues\u00a0to be overlooked in favour of better-developed attractions in nearby Italy and Greece. But with the number of visitors steadily increasing year on year, it&apos;s only a matter of time before the obvious appeals of this small, picturesque nation begin to be recognised. Next year marks the completion of the Skopje 2014 project, a multimillion euro scheme to\u00a0transform the capital city \u2013 including the building of new bridges and museums and replacing the facades of buildings in a neo-classical style. However, the real treat for visitors is spectacular Lake Ohrid, a vast lake by whose edge perches a town of the\u00a0same\u00a0name the perfect place for a dreamy, and affordable, escape (see\u00a0ohrid.com.mk). 15. Paso Robles, California, US     The Artisan restaurant in Paso Robles    Napa and Sonoma wine-tasting rooms can get crammed with cheesy honeymooners but Paso Robles attracts an earthier oenophile \u2013 which isn&apos;t to say that the wine&apos;s not excellent. Dubbed &quot;the anti-Napa&quot;, Paso is slowly transforming into one of America&apos;s foodiest little towns. &quot;You can feel the energy,&quot; says Steve Heimof of Wine Enthusiast Magazine, which recently named Paso Robles wine region of the year. &quot;Over the past two years these winemakers have been making crazy, wild blends of red. It would be hard to do that in Napa: it&apos;s so traditional there.&quot; Since 2000, the number of wineries has quadrupled to\u00a0200 (sample top zinfandels and red blends at Dusi Vineyard or Epoch Wines , and while it seems a new chef moves in from LA or San Francisco every few months, an &quot;old&quot; favourite restaurant (circa 2006) is Artisan, famous for decadent lamb-leg dip and Cuban sandwiches. &quot;It&apos;s been exploding \u2013 for good and ill,&quot; says Jon Bonn\u00e9, wine editor for the San Francisco Chronicle. &quot;There&apos;s more tourist infrastructure \u2013 restaurants, small bakeries, places aimed at visitors who might not have appreciated Big Bubba&apos;s Bad to the Bone BBQ.&quot; 16. Rabat, Morocco Ask people to name a Moroccan city and most will say Marrakech or Fes, or even Casablanca. Poor Rabat \u2013 the country&apos;s capital \u2013 will probably be way down the list. Which is a shame, because it certainly has its draws, including a historic medina plenty of souks, and a French-colonial &quot;new town&quot;, one of the most ambitious 20th-century urban projects in Africa. Many visitors say they find it less chaotic than Marrakech. Rabat was given Unesco world heritage status in 2012 and the city could be on the brink of experiencing the Ryanair effect, as new flights link it to Stansted from February. (See rabat-tourisme.org.) 17. Yunnan, China     The rice terraces of Yuanyang. Photograph: King Wu/Getty    With its dramatic scenery and cultural diversity, the far south-western province of Yunnan is rapidly becoming a favourite with domestic tourists yet remains\u00a0relatively\u00a0unknown to foreigners. It&apos;s not difficult\u00a0to see the appeal:\u00a0in contrast to so many other parts of China, the\u00a0province has managed to stave off smog and factories,\u00a0instead preserving a pristine countryside dotted with traditional villages and overlooked by the kind of majestic\u00a0mountainous landscapes that have\u00a0inspired Chinese poets for centuries.\u00a0The ancient town\u00a0of Dali has become a magnet\u00a0for the nation&apos;s bohemians. Other\u00a0highlights include the rice terraces of\u00a0Yuanyang: these centuries-old paddy fields are home to\u00a0the Hani\u00a0people, just one of over\u00a050\u00a0recognised minority ethnic groups that call Yunnan home, and each\u00a0with its\u00a0own colourful and distinct customs, language and dress. Travel with Wendy\u00a0Wu Tours, which offers a 17-day Yunnan Adventure from \u00a32,690pp including flights, meals and accommodation. 18. Budapest, Hungary Wes Anderson&apos;s latest flick, The Grand Budapest Hotel, was mostly filmed in Gorlitz, in eastern Germany. But its fantasy pastel hues and sepia-toned aesthetic do whet the appetite for a central Europe escapade. And Budapest is still the best-value European city for a mini break according to a recent report by the Post Office. Renaissance and art-nouveau architecture provides a romantic backdrop to an increasingly hip destination; the newly opened Baltazar Hotel, with rooms by cutting-edge designers, is just one example, while the eighth district \u2013 previously a no-go zone \u2013 continues to flourish, with galleries and laid-back cafes. 19. Rwanda     Lake Kivu, Rwanda    This April marks the 20th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide (and an annual month of mourning). Few countries can have transformed so much in two decades. Today, under controversial president Paul Kagame, streets are spotless, people live in tin- or slate-roofed houses and 98% of the country has Wi-Fi access. But it&apos;s the country&apos;s natural wonders that are the big draw. The mountain gorillas made famous by Dian Fossey used to be the preserve of high-end travellers, but mid-range accommodation is starting to open in Virunga national park, and the development of the Congo Nile walking and mountain-biking trail \u2013 which takes in stunning Lake Kivu \u2013 will no doubt lure intrepid active travellers. With Nyungwe forest named a top trip by National Geographic, Rwanda&apos;s future as a nature destination is starting now. Book with Expert Africa. 20. Cuba &quot;Go now before it changes&quot; is the common refrain but Cuba is already changing. Legislation governing private enterprise is altering the visitor experience. Tourists have long been able to stay in a room in a private home \u2013 a casa particular \u2013 but now entire historic houses can be let. Suite Havana is a\u00a0fantastic two-bedroom apartment with a roof terrace in Old Havana. Ydalgo&apos;s Penthouse, is a three-bedroom apartment owned by a designer, in the city&apos;s Vedado district \u2013 which also features chic Cafe Madrigal. Both accommodations are available through new operator Miraviva, from about $250 a night. Casa particulares are changing too: kitsch homestays being superseded by stylish homes, such as beautiful Finca Kenia in Trinidad \u2013 a\u00a0great spot to enjoy this year&apos;s 500th anniversary celebrations. &quot;Now is a brilliant time to visit,&quot; says Charles Tyler of Miraviva. &quot;You have the trappings of communism, with no advertising, and no McDonalds, no Starbucks and so on, but a\u00a0better standard accommodation, really good food and new experiences.&quot; 21. Iceland     Iceland's mountains and lava field are making it popular with filmmakers. Photograph: Miles Wills/Getty    Iceland is gaining credibility as the &quot;Hollywood of the North&quot; after several blockbusters were shot there, including Oblivion, Prometheus and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Two of this year&apos;s anticipated hits were also shot amid the lava fields and glaciers: Interstellar, Christopher Nolan&apos;s sci-fi movie, and Darren Aronofsky&apos;s Noah. Tick off the locations on a road trip along the spectacular 832-mile &quot;route one&quot; ring-road (from \u00a3690pp with discover-the-world.co.uk). The first hotel in the new Stracta chain opens in May near Hella in south Iceland, with doubles from \u00a386. Wow\u00a0Air flies from Gatwick to Reykjavik from \u00a3138 return. 22. Abu Dhabi, UAE An island off Abu Dhabi is the antithesis of the glitz around it. Sir Bani Yas was founded as a wildlife reserve in the 1970s and, following a conservation programme, is home to Arabian oryx, cheetahs and flamingoes. The Anantara group&apos;s accommodation is &quot;luxury&quot; but its two new hotels feel unflashy: the 30 villas of Al Yamm overlook the beach and the turtle nesting grounds; the 30 villas of Al Sahel are in the savannah grasslands, where gazelle and giraffes graze in front of your balcony. Trailfinders has a seven-night two-hotel break from \u00a31,389pp. 23. Catskills, US     Phoenicia Diner, Phoenicia    These lush mountains 100\u00a0miles north-west of Manhattan have long been a\u00a0refuge for city folk, with New Yorkers sailing here up the Hudson river since the early 19th century and, of course, Woodstock has long attracted hippies. In recent years, though, the Catskills&apos; rustic barns and one-street towns have drawn a clutch of fashiony Brooklynites. Their top spot is the 300-person town of Phoenicia, where The Graham and Co hotel (doubles from $125, +1 845 688 7871) lives up to a hipster&apos;s country fantasy: guests are greeted with cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon at check in; rooms are furnished with machine-age metal fans, rough-hewn tables and potted succulents; and in the evenings everyone watches old movies sitting round a campfire. But New Yorkers would not venture here if the food wasn&apos;t decent. While it&apos;s all chocolate milkshakes and shrimp-and-grits at the Phoenicia Diner, a 1962-era haunt with a recent makeover, it&apos;s more New Yorky 10\u00a0minutes east at Peekamoose Restaurant in the town of Big Indian. Here,\u00a0the menu includes clam-studded ramen and succulent beef short ribs supplied by local farms and cooked by Manhattan chef-owners Devin and\u00a0Marybeth Mills. At Lucky Dog Organic Farm in Hamden, home-produced ingredients are made into lunches of\u00a0meatloaf panini or cauliflower and\u00a0cheddar soup, followed by &quot;killer\u00a0chocolate&quot; ice-cream from Mama&apos;s Boy Coffee Shop Some burn everything off by hiking the 5.6-mile Mount Tremper trail; others prefer browsing vintage dresses and vinyl at The Mystery Spot in Phoenicia. On the drive back to the city, you&apos;ll soon be able to stop at the Marina Abramovic Institute, where the revered performance artist is creating a\u00a0cultural spa. 24. Blackwater estuary, Essex, UK Island hopping in Essex? The idea may never have crossed your mind but there are great little spots out in the Blackwater estuary. Osea, the private island a few miles from Maldon where the rich and famous party, is hosting several special events this year: kids&apos; camps, boutique festivals, pop-up restaurants. Although a restaurant for daytrippers has been rumoured, only overnight guests are currently allowed to cross Osea&apos;s exclusive causeway (cottages for two from \u00a3295 for two nights). Less pricey and open to all is Mersea Island, famous for its seafood. Don&apos;t miss the delicious platters at The Company Shed . Leeward House, a B&amp;B by the beach, has doubles from \u00a370, or splash out \u2013 almost literally \u2013 on The Raft, a floating cabin sleeping four near Maldon from \u00a3195 a night. 25. Lagos, Nigeria     Kingdom brand by Caven + Etomi. Photograph: Picasa    Lagos is emerging as something of a creative hub. In fashion, the striking colours and bold fabrics used by labels such as Maki Oh (by Maki Osakwe) and Kingdom by Caven + Etomi, are helping bring global attention to the Nigerian fashion scene. The capital&apos;s art scene is opening up, too, with organisations such as Video Art Network Lagos curating film festivals and experimental media art events around the capital \u2013 though these are small-fry compared with the big-bucks Nollywood film industry. While it is predominantly visitors from other African countries who are drawn by Nollywood, the steady attention Nigerian films are getting in America and the UK means more international visitors will want to\u00a0visit its heartland. &quot;Nollywood has become a worldwide phenomenon,&quot; says Lagos- based artist Emeka Ogboh. &quot;People are curious to see the space it depicts.&quot; People are coming to feel the city&apos;s vibes and energy.&quot; 26. Dyess, Arkansas, US Arkansas isn&apos;t the type of place that figures too often on travel bucket lists. And Dyess, Arkansas (population 500) probably never has. But that is set to change this year with the opening of Johnny Cash&apos;s boyhood home as a museum (http://dyesscash.astate.edu). The single-storey wooden farmstead is being returned to its original state as part of a $10m tourist project designed to get the town back on its feet \u2013 echoing the fresh start Cash&apos;s parents got when they were given the farm in the 1930s as part of President Franklin D Roosevelt&apos;s New Deal. The house is the centrepiece of a restoration project that aims to tell the history of the purpose-built Depression-era town. It is scheduled to open on 26 April, and the hope is that some of the 600,000 people who visit Graceland, home of Cash&apos;s contemporary Elvis Presley, will drive a further 50 miles north from Memphis to the Man in Black&apos;s museum. Cash&apos;s surviving brother and sister have ensured that all the furnishings \u2013 upright piano, pot-bellied stove, Silvertone tabletop radio \u2013 are authentic and accurate. 27. Mongolia     Chinggis Khaan statue near the Mongolian capital, Ulaan Baatar. Photograph: Alamy    Mongolia, land of windswept plains, nomadic herdsmen and abundant wildlife, used to be the preserve of explorers and intrepid backpackers. But an increase in visitor numbers, by 11% between 2009 and 2012, has prompted interest from tour operators. Overland specialist Dragoman has a new 21-day trip for 2014, with wild camping, hiking and horse-riding (from \u00a31,102pp with a kitty of US$710, excluding flights), while Black Tomato has introduced a nomadic ski adventure ending with an ice festival on a frozen lake (from \u00a34,285pp). With the government pouring money into infrastructure \u2013 construction has started on a new airport near capital Ulan Bator \u2013 tourism is set to play an even greater role in the country&apos;s economy. That&apos;s not to say the place is about to get crowded - this is still one of the last untamed destinations in the world. 28. Yorkshire, UK Hosting the Grand D\u00e9part of the 2014 Tour de France puts a place on the map but there&apos;s a\u00a0lot more to Yorkshire than two days of carbon bikes and Lycra. In fact, the Tour route misses a lot of what&apos;s best in the region: the North York Moors, the North Sea coast, and the Wolds in East Yorkshire. Whitby has been an attraction since Victorian days: Lewis Carroll was a regular at what is now the La Rosa Hotel, but Scarborough and Filey further south are great, too. Even Bridlington, powered by resident David Hockney, is on the up, perhaps helped by the award-winning Wold Top Brewery. Beer is excellent throughout Yorkshire and there&apos;s a\u00a0new brewery, Stod Fold, in Halifax, to add to an impressive list. Good food is found in simple cafes: the Little Organic Bakery on Wellington Road in Bridlington is a new gem; and for great fish and chips, try the Harbour View Cafe on Scarborough&apos;s West Pier. There are Michelin stars, too \u2013 more than in any other county. One newcomer, The Star in the City in York, is run by Andrew Pern, who built The Star at Harome into a top restaurant with rooms. With Hull set to be City of Culture 2017, Leeds&apos; modern events arena, and Sheffield boasting more artists than London, Yorkshire is definitely buzzing. 29. La Maremma, Italy     La Maremma. Photograph: Alamy    La Maremma was Tuscany&apos;s final frontier, a quiet area of rugged protected coastline from Capalbio up to Cecina. Over the past few years, though, the cognescenti have been taking notice, and while it is still no Forte dei Marmi (Tuscany&apos;s most fashionable resort), there have been some illustrious openings: Alain Ducasse&apos;s L&apos;Andana hotel in Castiglione della Pescaia (from \u20ac300), Leonardo Ferragamo&apos;s marina in Puntone, and Renzo Piano&apos;s \u00a36.7m winery at the Rocca di Frassinello vineyard. But the super-rich don&apos;t have it all to themselves. New to boutique accommodation website i-escape this year is Locanda Rossa (doubles from \u20ac120 B&amp;B) in Capalbi, close to the beach at Chiarone. It has 13 rooms, four apartments sleeping six, a restaurant and a pool. 30. Panama City  When hipster hotel chain Ace started looking for its first forays outside the US, it picked London first, then Panama City. Central America wasn&apos;t an obvious second move, but those who have spent time in the city&apos;s Casco Viejo neighbourhood can see the appeal. Sometimes compared to the French Quarter of New Orleans, the area mixes faded glory (dilapidated townhouses and 17th-century city walls) with newfound style (boutiques, cafes and fancy ice-cream parlours such as Grancl\u00e9ment on Central Avenue. The Ace project \u2013 a collaboration with Commune Design of Los Angeles and local property developer Conservatorio \u2013 has just opened as the American Trade Hotel (doubles from $259 +tax). At the other end of the scale, hostel Luna&apos;s Castle (dorm beds from \u00a38 a night) is a down-to-earth party favourite. 31. Gdansk, Poland      Gdansk skyline. Photograph: Maria Sw\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a4rd/Getty    In 1980, Lech Wa\u0142esa started a strike in a Gdansk shipyard that was the beginning of the end of the Soviet bloc. In summer 2014, the European Solidarity Centre \u2013 a museum, library and research centre \u2013 is set to open on the same spot, as a celebration of freedom and democracy. And that&apos;s not the only reason to come to this Baltic seaport. Gdansk has plenty to offer as a city-break destination, without feeling as touristy as Krakow. There&apos;s also far more to the local food scene than potato- and cabbage-stuffed pierogi; try the seafood at Bulaj in the nearby seaside resort of Sopot, or modern Polish recipes at Brovarnia , a buzzing waterside microbrewery and restaurant in the city. 32. Glasgow, UK If your image of Glasgow is all rusting shipyards and deep-fried confectionery, 2014 would be a good time to rediscover Scotland&apos;s largest city as it welcomes the world during perhaps the biggest year in its history. That Glasgow is a fast-growing city-break destination is impressive: it did not even have a tourist office until the 1980s. In 1990, European City of Culture status kickstarted the regeneration. In 1999, the UK\u00a0City of Architecture and Design award had a similar effect. Glasgow is indeed a city transformed. In Finnieston, in between the centre and the West End, Zaha Hadid&apos;s Riverside Museum, named European Museum of the Year 2013, was joined last September by the sleek SSE Hydro concert and sports venue. The Hydro will be one of the stars of this summer&apos;s 2014 Commonwealth Games. The cultural scene will be further boosted by Homecoming Scotland 2014, with dozens of cultural, historic and gastronomic events. Then there are the MTV Music Awards, being held in this Unesco City of Music for the first time, partly in recognition of the successful recent staging of a trio of Mobo Awards. 33. Tasmania, Australia     Bruny Island. Photograph: Jodie Griggs/Getty    With one of the world&apos;s finest state capitals, some great beaches and a hinterland made for adventure and exploration, Tasmania already has a lot going for it but 2014 promises to be especially good. There&apos;s stylish new accommodation such as the &quot;boutique budget&quot; Alabama Hotel (doubles from \u00a344) in a rejuvenated 1830s building in Hobart, or the full wilderness experience at New South West Wilderness Camp, which has just opened four huts in the South West national park, a largely untouched mountain region. The outdoors does come first in Tasmania \u2013 remember the successful campaign to protect the Franklin River? \u2013 but it is swiftly followed by food. On Bruny Island, captain Rob Pennicott does a great day trip where you collect seafood and then cook it on board (pennicottjourneys.com.au, day trips \u00a3370pp). Garagistes is arguably Hobart&apos;s top restaurant of the moment, but there are a few snapping at its heels: Lebrina, also in Hobart, and Stillwater in Launceston are fine places. And for an informal cafe atmosphere Hobartians head to Smolt in the Salamanca market area. 34. Somerset, UK Somerset is no longer a\u00a0West Country backwater. First came the celebrities. Then independent shops, restaurants and elegant places to stay such as At The Chapel helped put pretty-but-otherwise-unremarkable spots such as Bruton on the map. Now, the whole world looks set to take notice of this tiny village, as global art powerhouse Hauser &amp; Wirth sets up shop on nearby Durslade Farm. The project is driven by visionaries Iwan and Manuela Wirth, who live nearby, and will include contemporary art spaces, a guesthouse and gardens by Piet Oudolf. Across the county in Bath, the Gainsborough (doubles from \u00a3289) is the first hotel to tap the town&apos;s thermal waters (the famous Bath Spa does not have accommodation). It will open this spring with 99 rooms and an enormous spa/bathing area inside a listed Georgian building. 35. Taiwan      Yong Kang Street, Taipei, Taiwan. Photograph: Justin Guariglia/Corbis    Ever tried gua bao, the Taiwanese dish of pork belly in a steamed bun? A Taiwanese street food purveyor called Bao, based in London&apos;s Hackney, is on a mission to bring it to the British masses and has had an exceptional first year, winning accolades from Young British Foodies and the British Street Food Awards (people&apos;s choice award). Now the team behind it are hoping to inspire people to travel to Taiwan by launching a food tour, via Opentrips (opentrips.co.uk, five nights from 14 March, \u00a3645pp excluding flights). Founder Erchen Chang says her top tip is to visit the city of Tainan in southern Taiwan: &quot;It&apos;s the true capital of street food \u2013 and definitely not made for tourists.&quot; From oyster omelettes in Taipei&apos;s night markets to tea in a Maokong plantation, Taiwan is a fascinating place to eat and drink your way around. For year-round food tours, see taiwanfoodadventure.com, or learn to make the dishes yourself with a cookery lesson at Jodie&apos;s Kitchen. 36. Bangladesh &quot;Visit before the tourists come&quot;: it&apos;s telling that the Bangladesh tourist board&apos;s slogan, introduced in 2006, still applies. While Burma and India, which it borders, are high on many travel wishlists, Bangladesh remains largely overlooked, despite having assets that include the world&apos;s longest beach (Cox&apos;s Bazar&apos;s 77\u00a0miles of sand, pictured) and the tiger&apos;s share of the world&apos;s largest mangrove forest (the Sundarbans, home to Bengal tigers). Travelling here isn&apos;t necessarily easy (and protests ahead of January elections mean visitors should check before booking), but they will be warmly welcomed. British-Bangladeshi Yasmin Choudhury has started Lovedesh.com, a website that focuses on the positives of otherwise stigmatised &quot;third world&quot; destinations, and to ensure her parents&apos; homeland is not written off as a pitiful place, known only for floods. The website has a travel element and she will lead its first trip to Bangladesh at Easter (10 nights from \u00a31,400, excluding flights), utilising her local contacts to showcase the country&apos;s little-known highlights, including boat trips through rural Sylhet and plenty of wood-fired curries. Exodus has also just launched a 15-day tour (from \u00a32,099, including flights). 37. Moscow, Russia     Jeff Koons' Caterpillar Chains at The Garage, Moscow    It&apos;s hard to ignore the furore around Russia at the moment. But although the recent releases of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Pussy Riot may have been more government charm offensive than genuine democratic change (homosexuality is not illegal, as is commonly reported, though anti-gay hostility does exist), some areas, such as Moscow, are more forward-thinking. The capital is buzzing with a post-bling nightlife and a contemporary arts scene, and there is at least talk of change in the air, much of it about Dasha Zhukova&apos;s Garage cultural centre. A new home for this ambitious project by the socialite, art collector and girlfriend of Roman Abramovich is still under construction in Gorky Park, on the site of a ruined Soviet-era restaurant, but there are already plans to stage fairs and shows that will attract both artists and visitors from around the world. Interested Brits should be aware that Moscow is not your typical budget airline city break: it&apos;s a four-hour flight, and you need to brave the Kafkaesque business of applying for a Russian visa. But easyJet&apos;s new routes to Moscow from Manchester and Gatwick, and Ryanair&apos;s Dublin-Moscow route, which will launch this spring (with flights from the UK sure to follow if it&apos;s successful), mean the travelling classes will be arriving soon. 38. Folkestone, UK Beyond the town&apos;s shabby (but improving) seafront, a grassroots arts scene has bubbled into a fully-fledged movement. Buoyed by the renaissance of nearby Hastings and Margate, the work of its artisans is now celebrated in the Folkestone Triennial. The event, curated by Lewis Biggs, formerly of Tate Liverpool, returns for a third time from 30\u00a0August-2\u00a0November. Works will be shown in public spaces such as the Creative Quarter, a colourful area of shops, studios and cafes, and a picturesque symbol of the town&apos;s changing mood. 39. Canberra, Australia     National Museum of Australia    The joke is that you &quot;See Yourself in Canberra&quot;, as the tourist board puts it, because there&apos;s not much else to see in the Australian capital. And while it will never be a creative rival to Sydney or Melbourne, a commitment to art and architecture is adding cultural depth to the diminutive city (population 358,000). The new Hotel Hotel (doubles from \u00a3167) is not just a 90-room place to stay. It aims to promote local artisans by showcasing their work in the form of locally made or found furniture, artwork inspired by the bush or soft furnishings reflecting aboriginal patterns, and is part of a striking new complex that includes an open-air cinema, a bike shop and an art gallery. Meanwhile the geometric new cafe extension to the National Museum of Australia is an example of a burgeoning design scene. 40. Ume\u00e5, Sweden As enthusiasm for all things Scandi continues, lesser-known corners are muscling in. The small town of Ume\u00e5 in northern Sweden is on the periphery of Europe culturally as well as geographically, so its status this year as a European Capital of Culture is perhaps surprising, especially given that one of its attractions is the weird Umedalen sculpture park, with Gormleys and Kapoors in the grounds of a former mental asylum. It also has two Eurovision-themed clubs and is about to get a snazzy new cultural centre. Renovation of the historic Stora hotel in the centre will be completed by March."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/07/indigenous-people-face-greater-risks-from-new-strain-of-bird-flu-study-finds", "publicationDate": "2014-01-07T03:06:13Z", "tags": ["Bird flu", "Indigenous peoples", "Science", "Immunology", "Australia news"], "sentences": ["The H7N9 virus emerged in China in March last year and has so far spread to Hong Kong and Taiwan."], "title": "Indigenous people face greater risks from new strain of bird flu, study finds", "article": "A new, severe version of \u201cbird flu\u201d could pose a significant risk to Indigenous people, after researchers found they were far more susceptible to the virus than other Australians. A study conducted by the University of Melbourne found that human immunity to the H7N9 influenza virus, which emerged in China last year, varied according to ethnicity. Researchers tested the prevalence and responsiveness of virus-killing T cells, key in natural immunity, in people of varying ethnicities. While 57% of \u201cCaucasoid\u201d people had a robust T-cell response to the virus, just 16% of Indigenous people in Australia and north America had the same protection. The H7N9 virus emerged in China in March last year and has so far spread to Hong Kong and Taiwan. It is a strain of the avian influenza, or bird flu, virus that shot to prominence due to pandemic fears over another strain, H5N1. So far, about 150 people have been infected globally by the H7N9 virus, with around a third of them dying. The University of Melbourne researchers warn that the H7N9 strain, which is spread by birds to humans and has the potential to mutate to allow human-to-human infection, is potentially more dangerous than H5N1. \u201cThe virus is a concern because it has a high mortality rate of around 30% from acute respiratory distress syndrome,\u201d report co-author Katherine Kedzierska, associate professor at the University of Melbourne\u2019s department of microbiology and immunology, told Guardian Australia. \u201cHumans have no prior history with the virus, so we lack the antibodies to fight it. We looked at cellular immunity, which is our pre-existing immunity, and found the prevalence of T-cell immunity greatly depends on ethnicity.\u201d Kedzierska said Indigenous people lacked a key protein needed to fight the virus, with their historical isolation making them relatively ill-equipped to deal with new viruses. \u201cCaucasians have the most immunity because they have adapted to flu viruses and developed mechanisms to fight them off,\u201d she said. \u201cIndigenous people don\u2019t have that, which provides an explanation why there were such high mortality rates from the Spanish flu in 1918, when 10-20% of Indigenous people in Australia died, compared to just 1% of Caucasian people.\u201d Kedzierska said it was important for the government to factor in the different levels of immunity in different ethnicities when developing responses to flu outbreaks. Researchers are now working on finding ways to boost T-cell immunity in Indigenous communities, in order to develop a tailored vaccine for the virus."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/jan/09/forgotten-story-of-dallas-tornado", "publicationDate": "2014-01-09T10:17:00Z", "tags": ["Football", "US sports", "Sport"], "sentences": ["&quot;But we were allowed to walk around Saigon on our own as sightseers!&quot; Despite a telling off from American Military Police for standing still on a Saigon street corner \u2013 a dangerous move with locals patrolling the area on scooters armed with hand grenades \u2013 Crosbie and the team left Vietnam unscathed and unbeaten, and travelled via Hong Kong to Taiwan, where they beat the national team in front of 43,000."], "title": "The forgotten story of \u2026 Dallas Tornado's 1967-68 world tour | Neil Jones", "article": "If there is one thing lacking when it comes to modern football tours, it is usually the football. Money, adulation and marketing are the key tenets of a well-planned, well-publicised pre-season visit. Sporting gains are usually far outweighed by financial ones. What, then, would the Premier League bean counters have made of Dallas Tornado, and their extraordinary world tour of 1967-68? Playing 32 games, across five continents and 26 countries over a seven-month period, Dallas, in just about every sense, took on the world. From Spain in August to Honduras in March, via Christmas in Tokyo and New Year in Manila, this was genuine football globetrotting. And long before it was fashionable, too. No product-placement, milking the market or &quot;expanding the brand&quot; here. Dallas&apos; journey saw them cheat death, Final Destination style, at the hands of Greek-Cypriot terrorists, visit Vietnam whilst war raged around them, and survive an on-pitch riot in Singapore. The football, at times, must have felt like a sideshow. Some sideshow, mind. During the tour, Tornado played in front of crowds of up to 50,000, and against sides of the calibre of Real Oviedo, Fenerbahce and the Japanese national team. &quot;An amazing trip that will never be repeated again,&quot; is how Bill Crosbie, one of the players involved, describes the tour. Even that hardly seems to do it justice. This was a plot worthy of Hollywood. Crosbie was a 19-year-old bus conductor when he answered an advert in the Liverpool Echo, looking for &quot;top-class amateur footballers&quot;. Soon afterwards, he was asked to attend an interview at the city&apos;s Adelphi Hotel. There, he found a man named Bob Kap. Serbian by birth, Kap \u2013 real name Bo\u017eidar Kapu\u0161to \u2013 had studied alongside Ferenc Puskas at the Hungarian national football academy, but was forced to flee Europe during the 1956 uprising. He moved to Toronto, Canada, where he worked briefly as a reporter for a local football magazine. His true passion, though, was always for coaching. So when Dallas, looking for someone to prepare a team for the inaugural North American Soccer League, came calling, he jumped at the chance. Kap used his contacts to recruit from across Europe. Eight of the touring side were English, and seven of those were Merseysiders. They were supplemented by five Norwegians, two Dutchmen, two Swedes and, improbably, just one American, Jay Moore. Crosbie remembers his initial meeting with Kap well: &quot;I was asked a lot of questions, about the amateur teams I had played for, how fast a runner I was, why I wanted to join his team, things like that.&quot; Flanking the coach was Dave Moorcroft, a local amateur player of some pedigree. Moorcroft had played for Skelmersdale United at Wembley in the FA Amateur Cup final, and would go on to play more than 100 times for Tranmere Rovers. &quot;He was there to vet the players,&quot; remembers Crosbie. &quot;I remember leaving thinking that was the last I would hear on that.&quot; He was wrong. A month later, a telegram arrived at his home, asking him to a second meeting, this time at the Regent Hotel. It was the message that would change his life. &quot;He asked me how much notice I would have to give at work,&quot; says Crosbie. &quot;I said two weeks, but in extreme circumstances one week. He told me if I wanted to join his team then I would have to fly to the South of France the following morning!&quot; Crosbie, who had he been on duty that night would have missed Kap&apos;s telegram, agreed, only to be told there was a further condition from his new manager. &quot;Bob told me that the next time he saw me, I had better have had a haircut!&quot; he remembers. &quot;My hair was shoulder-length at the time, very much like The Beatles, but Bob wanted an All American look, crew cuts for everyone. It had to go.&quot; Luckily, one of Crosbie&apos;s neighbours was a hairdresser, and so was summoned to an emergency 10pm appointment. Bill&apos;s brother was given a resignation letter to hand in to his bosses, and that was that. He was on the first train out of Lime Street the following morning. &quot;We did not have a phone, so I could not even contact my girlfriend to say goodbye!&quot; Crosbie laughs. Together with another Scouser, Bobby Roach, Crosbie flew to Nice to join up with the side. Tornado had already played five games by that point, visiting both Spain and Morocco. The last was a 4-0 defeat to Real Oviedo, then playing in the Segunda Division. With Crosbie and Bobby Roach on board, and with the players instructed to wear club suits complete with Stetson hats wherever they went, Dallas travelled to Istanbul, drawing 2-2 with the Turkish champions Fenerbahce, having led 2-0 at one stage, in front of a crowd of 25,000. Crosbie missed the game with a virus, which doctors believed was caused by undergoing too many injections within a short space of time. Their next game was to take place in Cyprus, though fate would rear its head before then. After a day sightseeing at the Acropolis, the team were delayed heading to the airport and missed their flight from Athens to Nicosia by half an hour. Lucky them. Flight BEA CY284 exploded at 29,000ft after a bomb was detonated under a seat, killing 63 people. Its intended target, the Greek army general Georgios Grivas, had also missed the flight, and later travelled to Nicosia on the same plane as the Tornado team. &quot;Missing that plane was the best thing we ever did,&quot; says Crosbie, with grim understatement. &quot;But that second flight was the longest two hours of my life!&quot; Two defeats in Cyprus, including one in 95 degree heat, were followed by a trip, via Beirut, to Tehran, where they took on an Iranian Air Force team containing seven internationals, losing 2-1. Draws with a Tehran Select XI and a Governors&apos; XI in Shiraz followed. Kap, though, was preparing to shake up his squad. Crosbie remembers: &quot;A new player called Graham Stirland had joined the tour in France. He was a winger, a fantastic player who was always getting back to help his fullback out. &quot;We arrived in Tehran for our next flight and Graham was asked to follow Frank Randorf, Bob Kap&apos;s assistant, to the toilets. Ten minutes later, Frank returned alone. When we asked where Graham was, we were told that Mr Kap did not think he was mixing with the other players and he was sent home to England. We were not even allowed to say goodbye and that was the last we saw of him.&quot; From Tehran, the squad embarked upon a mammoth tour of the Iranian mountains, taking in games in Rasht and Shahi, as well as three seven-hour coach journeys. With the squad preparing to leave Iran for Pakistan, the Norwegian defender Tom Weinholdt returned home to undergo knee surgery, reducing Kap&apos;s numbers to just 16, of which two were goalkeepers. Nonetheless, Tornado saw off the Pakistan national team 2-0 in front of 35,000 spectators in Karachi. The following day, in Lahore, a new Pakistani side gained revenge, winning the &apos;Second Test&apos; 4-2 in front of 25,000. Games in Lahore, Dhaka and Chittagong followed, before the side headed to India. &quot;We took a four-hour ride on a rickety old bus to the border,&quot; says Crosbie. &quot;Then when we got to the border, we had to take our suitcases off the bus and walk the last 400 yards. &quot;There were local rioters screaming and hurling abuse because the country we were walking to was India. We got through passport control and walked 400 yards to our next bus, and the people were laying garlands at our feet!&quot; To make matters worse, a number of non-Commonwealth players had been denied entry to India, and were forced to spend two days waiting for their visas in a run-down hotel near to the border. &quot;They told us the only thing they had to eat in those days was a small chicken,&quot; says Crosbie, whose British passport ensured he made it through without a hitch. Dallas played seven games in India, winning only one, before heading to Sri Lanka. Having lost two games against the national team, they were off to Burma but, typically, their journey was not without danger. &quot;We should have flown via Madras and Calcutta on the 25th of November,&quot; says Crosbie. &quot;But when we got to Calcutta there were political riots going on and all flights were cancelled. We had to hide in our hotel for two days, playing billiards and cards, and left on the 28th at 4am to sneak out of India.&quot; From Burma, and a defeat to the national team in front of 47,000, it was on to Singapore, and a hostile reception from locals angered at the arrival of &quot;Yankee Imperialists&quot;. That hostility extended from the stands to the pitch. Crosbie remembers: &quot;When one of our players, Per Larsen, fouled one of theirs, they started throwing stones and other things onto the pitch. Per then further annoyed them by bowing. We had to be escorted from the pitch and stayed in the dressing room for two hours after the game.&quot; A re-match the following day was, wisely, cancelled, and the team travelled to Jakarta for two games, before moving on to Saigon. This was a critical juncture in the Vietnam War. The Tet offensive, seen by many as the turning point of the conflict, began a month after Tornado&apos;s last game, a 2-2 draw with Club Saigon. &quot;We were well-protected, with a police escort from the airport to hotel,&quot; says Crosbie. &quot;But we were allowed to walk around Saigon on our own as sightseers!&quot; Despite a telling off from American Military Police for standing still on a Saigon street corner \u2013 a dangerous move with locals patrolling the area on scooters armed with hand grenades \u2013 Crosbie and the team left Vietnam unscathed and unbeaten, and travelled via Hong Kong to Taiwan, where they beat the national team in front of 43,000. Christmas was spent in Tokyo. The players were each given portable Panasonic radios as gifts from the management, and sampled the delights of sushi for the first time before losing 3-2 to Japan in Osaka on Boxing Day. They had already lost 2-1 in Tokyo&apos;s Olympic Stadium, used for the 1964 Games, on Christmas Eve. Next stop was Manila, and a 7-0 win over a Select XI on New Year&apos;s Day. A defeat to the Philippines National team followed, before an 18-hour journey to Australia for what was to be the home stretch of the tour. Nine games, spread across Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tahiti, saw a tiring team, minus the goalkeeper Odd Linberg who had returned home ill, win just three times. By the time they headed back to Dallas on 15 February, they were given two weeks to &quot;set up their lives&quot; ahead of the NASL season, before a four-game &quot;mini-tour&quot; of Central America. &quot;We were exhausted, both mentally and physically,&quot; says Crosbie, and his assessment would appear to have been spot on. Dallas lost their first league game 6-0 to Houston Stars, and won just four of their 32 NASL fixtures that season, losing 26. Their goal difference, minus 81, told its own story. Kap, unsurprisingly, was replaced by Keith Spurgeon early in the campaign. Crosbie, too, would depart early. Having snapped ankle ligaments in a game on a baseball pitch at St Louis, he would eventually leave the squad after playing just six matches. &quot;I enjoyed my time in the USA,&quot; he says. &quot;But my work Visa only allowed me to play soccer. This was the time of Vietnam, and foreign nationals who were not using their work visas could be drafted to the US army. The risk was too great, so I went back to England.&quot; Dallas would play a key role in the NASL until their dissolution in 1981. They were championship winners in 1971, and finished runners up two years later. The likes of Alex Stepney, Alan Hinton and the Liverpool duo Kevin Kewley and Brian Kettle would all represent the club at various points. Their World Tour, however, is easily the greatest, most incredible tale in their history. As Crosbie, who hopes to organise a reunion for the players next year, says, we will never see its kind again. Kap&apos;s legacy, meanwhile, remains. He is widely credited with changing the face of NFL by introducing &quot;soccer-style&quot; kickers to the game in the early 1970s. One of his recommendations, an Austrian named Toni Fritsch, was the first European-trained soccer player to play in the NFL, and Kap would directly introduce eight more in the next three years. Ever the innovator, Kap would attract headlines in 1978 when fronting a &quot;business syndicate&quot; that attempted to acquire the Argentine World Cup star Ricky Villa. The bid, audacious in the extreme, failed. Villa, along with Ossie Ardiles, moved to Tottenham instead. In later years, Kap would become an accomplished painter. Some of his work, Gridiron-themed, can be found in the NFL Hall of Fame building in Canton, Ohio. Kap died in his sleep in Ontario, Ottawa in March 2010, aged 87.

LG has always been a bit player in the PC market, with shipments of at best a few million PCs per year - in a market where the largest companies would expect to shift 10 times more. As one unnamed LG employee told the Korean Times, exiting the PC business makes sense: &quot;it doesn&apos;t make sense to put more resources into the money-losing business.&quot; It&apos;s not just LG that&apos;s hurting. The PC business is in a slump which has seen year-on-year shipments (and so sales) of Windows PCs fall for five (imminently, six) quarters in a row, after seven quarters where they barely grew by more than 2%. The situation is a long way from the boom times of the late 1990s, which saw 20%-plus quarterly growth. And it&apos;s not only growth that&apos;s fallen. Analysis by the Guardian suggests that as well as falling sales, the biggest PC manufacturers now have to contend with falling prices and dwindling margins on the equipment they sell. Price and profit falls     PC market global shipments, 3Q 1998 - 3Q 2013. Source: IDC. Photograph: /IDC/PR    My research took published data from the quarterly financial figures for HP, Dell, Lenovo, Acer and Asus, which together make more than 60% of the world&apos;s Windows PC shipments. By comparing revenues, operating profits (which excludes one-off windfalls from investments) and the proportion of revenues derived from business segments, it&apos;s straightforward to figure out how much each PC costs to make, and how much profit it generates for the big companies. (For Acer and Asus, which operate in Taiwan, I used the prevailing exchange rate at each quarter&apos;s end to give US dollar revenues. Lenovo reports its figures in US dollars.) This yields the &quot;weighted average selling price&quot; (ASP) of PCs from those companies. It&apos;s weighted because HP sells more PCs than Acer; and the ASP is the price at which the manufacturers sell machines to wholesalers, not the end-user price. Bitten by ASPs     Average per-PC revenues for various PC manufacturers over time, by quarter. Lines show overall price trend. Based on reported revenues and shipments figures from accounts (Apple) or IDC (others). Photograph: /IDC/PR    The data shows that the weighted average selling price (ASP) of a PC has fallen from $614.60 in the first quarter of 2010 to just $544.30 in the third quarter of 2013, the most recent date for which data is available. Even worse is the profitability. From the financial data and shipment data, it&apos;s easy enough to calculate the per-PC profitability of each company, though it creates a confusing picture. (The Microsoft figure is calculated from figures given for its Windows division; however, they vary greatly because much of that division&apos;s revenue comes from corporate sales to its existing installed base of PCs, rather than directly from shipments.)     Average per-PC profit for major PC manufacturers, by quarter. Calculated from published financial data and IDC shipment figures. Photograph: /Guardian    It&apos;s hard to see what&apos;s happening immediately. But we can calculate a &quot;weighted average profit per PC&quot; by looking at the profitability of each company, and weighting that by the number of PCs shipped. This gives a far clearer picture.     Average per-PC profit for the five largest PC manufacturers, with trend line. Note: doesn't include Asus data before 2Q 2010 as PC shipment data isn't available. Photograph: /Guardian    In the first quarter of 2010, the weighted average profit per PC was $15.71 - a 2.55% margin. (So the overall per-PC cost of manufacture, sales and marketing was just under $599.) But since then, the rise of smartphones (which began outselling PCs at the end of 2010) and the arrival of the iPad and other tablets have eaten into the fortunes of PC makers. So much so that by the third quarter of 2013, the weighted average profit had fallen to $14.87. That actually marks an improvement in margin, to 2.73% - but the absolute fall both in profits and numbers shipped means that companies are struggling. (The per-PC manufacturing/marketing/sales cost fell to $529. It&apos;s getting cheaper to produce PCs - but the price they&apos;re being sold for is falling too.) For the Taiwanese company Acer, it has meant a brutal boardroom shakeout that saw its chief executive forced out after two successive quarters of losses. That contrasts with the comments made in January 2010, when its founder Stan Shih remarked\u00a0that US-based PC manufacturers would die out over the next 20 years because they couldn&apos;t make the low-priced netbook computers that consumers were demanding. &quot;The trend for low-priced computers will last for the coming years,&quot; said Shih confidently. The problem is that his prediction is coming true. PCs are getting cheaper. But they&apos;re not making much money for their makers. Welcome to the value trap. The value trap The problem for Windows PC makers is that they are caught in the &quot;value trap&quot;. Even as prices are being forced down by commoditisation and slumping demand, they have no obvious way to capture any of the money that a consumer who buys one of their products subsequently spends with it. While HP and Dell (and to a lesser extent Lenovo) use PC sales to corporations as the Trojan horse for more profitable services contracts, any PC sale to a consumer is effectively the end of the financial relationship. The OEMs can&apos;t extract any more value from them. That&apos;s why many tried (and still try) to extract as much as possible at the point of sale. Chrystalla Labesque, PC analyst at research company IDC, points to Dell as a classic example: &quot;It was the leader in pushing costs down, and adding additional services as a way to improve their hardware margin - so when selling notebooks to consumers, they would offer antivirus and notebook accessories. Those could double their per-PC profit.&quot; When you think how thin that profit could be, you understand the purpose of &quot;crapware&quot; preinstalled on so many Windows PCs: to escape from the value trap. As Jack Schofield noted in recommending a Dell purchase last May, &quot;Dell&apos;s Vostro range is aimed at boring business buyers rather than consumers, so they tend to be well made and they don&apos;t include a lot of bundled crapware to mess things up.&quot; For Asus and Acer, which don&apos;t have substantial sales to business, the attempted solution has been to offer &quot;cloud&quot; services, though with little result. The idea is sound - retain consumers by tying them to the brand, and so to future sales - but set against the might of Google or Microsoft, it&apos;s an uphill struggle. The value trap is deep, though. Because Windows and its apps are easily moved from one PC to another (which is a huge benefit to the consumer), it&apos;s almost impossible for hardware makers to differentiate themselves from rivals. In the past, their best hope has been to encourage repeat buying through having extra hardware features; that&apos;s what some are trying to do with touchscreen laptops and desktops now. But there&apos;s little sign that buyers are enthusiastic about those, preferring instead to buy offerings that are just a little cheaper. That means there is always downward pressure on both prices and margins, while the only way to make useful profits is to be able to build at scale. The alternative is, like HP and Dell, to use PCs as a Trojan horse to sell much more profitable services to businesses. The value trap is the reason why L\u00e9o Apotheker suggested that HP should sell off its PC-selling Personal Systems Group\u00a0(PSG) when he was head of the company in 2011. PSG is HP&apos;s biggest division in revenue terms - but its worst-performing in profit margin, at less than 5% compared to Imaging (15%), Software (20% or more), Storage/Networking (15%), and until recently Services (which have dipped from 15% to 4%). Apotheker reasoned that if PSG could be spun off without hurting the rest of HP, overall margins would lift, and so would the stock. The rest of the board decided though that that wasn&apos;t possible - and spun Apotheker off instead. Dell, similarly, has struggled ever to make money selling its PCs to consumers: its &quot;global consumer&quot; division had profit margins which averaged 1% between February 2007 and January 2013. The rest of its business was much more profitable, but it&apos;s clear that selling PCs to the average person at home just wasn&apos;t a good business for it. (Dell&apos;s per-PC profits are calculated from its total PC revenues and its consumer segment profits.) &quot;Dell isn&apos;t really present in the consumer market,&quot; says Labesque. Lenovo, which completed its acquisition of IBM&apos;s PC business in the second quarter of 2005, has also struggled with profitability - but since it increased its reach by moving beyond China in the past couple of years, it has become more and more dominant, and profitable. It&apos;s managing to do this even while competes in smartphones - something that HP, its rival for the PC crown, has signally failed to do. &quot;With Lenovo, what isn&apos;t reflected is that they have a strong position in China, which means that they have efficiencies which other vendors can&apos;t leverage,&quot; explains Labesque. Asus and Acer, meanwhile, are clearly troubled by the disappearance of netbooks, even though those pulled down the ASP of PCs, because it has forced them into the potentially unprofitable field of tablets. Acer&apos;s financial results suggest that it has made a loss on almost every PC it has sold since the second quarter of 2011. Its best performance in that space was in the second quarter of 2012 - when for every PC it sold, it made an average profit of just $1.13. Asus&apos;s plans for the future - as set out in its Q3 2013 presentation\u00a0(PDF)\u00a0- focus on tablets, and particularly in trying to find extra profits there. But even with tablets, it&apos;s not easy. Asus estimates the TAM - total addressable market - as 202m, or 230m if you include &quot;white box&quot; makers in China making super-cheap devices. The competition there is ferocious, with the same downward pressure on price that is seen in PCs; and Apple always lurks at the high end with the iPad. In the personal computer market, Apple wins both ways: its ASPs are much higher than those of rival computer manufacturers, and it used to be able to sell OS upgrades, as well as upgrades to its iLife media and iWork office suites, providing a small but reliable income. This year, it has decided to stop charging for any of those upgrades - but it still takes a 30% commission on software bought through its Mac App Store (though users can still download and buy desktop apps from the web). With a claimed installed base worldwide of 72m\u00a0as of summer 2013 (up from 66m in summer 2012), it&apos;s a tidy revenue stream - especially compared to the pit that PC manufacturers find themselves in. Apple: squeezed, but less so     Apple average PC selling price v \"weighted\" average PC selling price for five main manufacturers. Photograph: /Guardian    Apple isn&apos;t immune from the downward pressure on pricing, though they&apos;ve only been mildly eroded, as shown in the graph. Its ASPs have eroded only mildly since 1Q 2010, from $1,277.61 to $1,229.56 (a 4% drop). And how profitable are Macs on their own, even without that revenue stream? Apple doesn&apos;t break out the figure for Mac profitability. But Horace Dediu of the Asymco consultancy reckons there&apos;s a good-enough rule of thumb: assume that Macs have an 18.9% profit margin, which fits well enough with its historical operating margins. That metric gives a hardware per-PC profit which has dropped from $241 to $232 - an erosion, certainly, but a margin that Windows PC makers would kill for: it&apos;s more than 10 times greater than their per-PC profit. Labesque at IDC says: &quot;Apple&apos;s cost to produce machines might be higher, but it isn&apos;t fundamentally different from other PC manufacturers. They used to have the best hardware margin - double-digit [ie over 10%] - while Acer, for instance, has been losing money.&quot; She notes that once you go outside the top-tier manufacturers, &quot;then there&apos;s Apple, and Samsung, and Sony, which are more consumer and lifestyle brands, where they can ask for a premium price.&quot; Doing that, of course, generally points to better margins. Samsung shipped around 11m PCs in 2013, and Sony slightly fewer than 5m, according to IDC. Apple sells around 16m PCs per year. Winners - and losers? So who wins? The most obvious beneficiary of every Windows PC sale is Microsoft. It gets revenue from the sale of the Windows licence - but it then captures extra value through the high likelihood that even consumer buyers of PCs will buy its Office suite, and probably buy another version of Windows at some point in that computer&apos;s life. It&apos;s the reason why Microsoft is so fabulously profitable, while PC manufacturers are struggling. Into this, the arrival of Chromebooks - running Google&apos;s Chrome OS - could be the early signs of a disruption. Although sales are tiny compared to the overall PC market, at a few million in 2013, they have the potential to undermine many of Microsoft&apos;s most lucrative markets. Chromebooks don&apos;t run Windows; they don&apos;t run Office. But they do pretty much everything that the average user needs (apart perhaps from running Skype; Microsoft&apos;s never going to go there). Google has been pushing Chromebooks into education and enterprises, with some success - as noted by NPD\u00a0(in data that was badly misunderstood by many, who thought it was referring to consumer sales). In July, Stephen Baker of NPD told Bloomberg: \u201cWhile we were sceptical initially, I think Chromebooks definitely have found a niche in the marketplace\u2026 The entire computing ecosystem is undergoing some radical change, and I think Google has its part in that change.\u201d At the research group Gartner, where research director Annette Jump agrees that &quot;the profit squeeze on PCs is very real&quot;, the expectation is that Chromebooks will make slow - but real - inroads. For 2013, it reckons that Chromebooks would have been about 0.5% of total shipments - compared to 92% for Windows, 6% for Apple and 1% for Linux. By 2017, the expectation is that the overall market will be about the same size, or slightly smaller. Windows will have fallen to just 83%; Apple will make up 11% (which, if even vaguely correct, would be its largest share in decades), while Chrome will be about 4.5%. That might not be a lot of Chromebooks, though it&apos;s likely they could be going to some key customers: the ones who used to reliably buy Windows and then subsequently Office. For Microsoft, that is a threat - and one which may be behind its curious decision to make an advert dissing Chromebooks. Consumers probably won&apos;t care that they don&apos;t run Office; the advert&apos;s &quot;dog whistle&quot; message may have been to people in businesses considering them. Meanwhile for PC manufacturers, seeing sales slump and profits weaken, something certainly does have to change. So maybe we should take it as a portent that although LG did announce a couple of hybrid Windows 8 machines\u00a0at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) this week, the only computer is showed off in its stage presentation was an all-in-one (AIO) desktop computer. And its software?

The US said the regulations are provocative and potentially dangerous. Tensions in the South China Sea have risen in recent years as a result of a complex disagreements among six nations. The area boasts valuable energy resources, as well as fisheries and some of the world&apos;s busiest shipping channels. A separate territorial dispute between China and Japan, in the East China Sea, has also drawn in the US and sparked concern about regional stability. Criticising the new rules for the South China Sea on Thursday, Jen Psaki, a US state department spokeswoman, said: &quot;Our long-standing position has been that all concerned parties should avoid any unilateral action that raises tensions and undermines the prospects for a diplomatic or other peaceful resolution of differences.&quot; But on Friday Beijing&apos;s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the disagreement was &quot;not a problem of regulation \u2026 but a problem of the mentality of the reader&quot;. The new rules were introduced by China&apos;s southern Hainan province on 1\u00a0January. They require foreign fishing crews to obtain permits before working in much of the South China Sea. They are based on a Chinese law passed in 2004. Chunying said the government was acting according to international and domestic law, adding: &quot;For more than 30 years, China&apos;s relevant fisheries laws and regulations have been consistently implemented in a normal way, and have never caused any tension.&quot; To insist that implementation posed a threat to regional stability showed &quot;either a lack of common sense or \u2026 ulterior motives&quot;, she added. The Philippine department of foreign affairs said the policy &quot;escalates tensions, unnecessarily complicates the situation in the South China Sea and threatens the peace and stability of the region.&quot; It added it had asked China for clarification and said the regulation violated international law. Vietnam&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman Luong Thanh Nghi said in a statement that Hanoi had indisputable sovereignty over the Spratly and Paracel Islands, and that &quot;all foreign activities in these areas without Vietnamese acceptance are illegal and invalid&quot;. Huang Jing, a north Asia security expert at Singapore&apos;s Lee Kuan Yew school for public policy, said there were questions about how China would enforce the rule and precisely which areas were covered. &quot;If there&apos;s some fishing boat from the Philippines or Malaysia or especially Vietnam \u2013 where the fishing industry accounts for a substantial part of GDP \u2013 by what means will China enforce the rules and will this lead to conflict? That&apos;s the issue,&quot; he said. He added: &quot;As China&apos;s capabilities become stronger and stronger, its behaviour seems to have become more and more assertive, especially in the South China Sea.&quot; Fishing crews have often been caught in the territorial wrangling. In March last year, Hanoi accused China of shooting at a Vietnamese fishing boat in the area and setting fire to its cabin. In May, a Taiwanese fisherman was shot dead by Philippines coastguards in waters claimed by both countries. Wu Shicun, the former head of Hainan&apos;s foreign affairs office, now leading a thinktank advising the government on the area, told Reuters news agency that offending foreign fishing vessels would be expelled from waters around Hainan and the disputed Paracel Islands. &quot;If we can&apos;t expel them, then we&apos;ll go on board to make checks to see whether there&apos;s any illegal fishing,&quot; said Wu, president of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies. &quot;We&apos;ll drag you back to be handled, confiscate fishing gear, detain the vessel and fine [you]. The most serious fine is 500,000 yuan [\u00a350,000].&quot; While the US is not directly involved in the South China Sea dispute, Jin Canrong, of Renmin University&apos;s School of International Studies, said it was concerned about its overall freedom of navigation. The US also took action when China announced the creation of an air defence identification zone over the East China Sea late last year, including airspace over disputed islands known as the Diaoyu to China and Senkaku to Japan. It flew two unarmed B52s through the zone. Jin said: &quot;Another concern of the US is that in the past, the US and its partners set the norms and rules in Asia and they are afraid [of whether] China tries to set norms of its own. China has risen so fast and is so big. It&apos;s natural for the US to have some concern.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/jan/10/romans-app-ipad-iphone-android", "publicationDate": "2014-01-10T16:27:42Z", "tags": ["Culture professionals network", "Digital", "Finance", "Arts education", "Museums", "Culture", "Education", "Apps"], "sentences": ["It also allows the collection to go out across the globe with downloads already being made in Taiwan, Spain, Canada and the US \u2013 not bad reach from Cirencester!"], "title": "How we made the Romans app for iPad, iPhone and Android", "article": "The Romans app was created by the Corinium Museum in response to a number of factors: the need to find new audiences and revenue streams, and the need to adopt modern technology \u2013 in both instances to make the museum&apos;s collections more widely available and accessible. As a small museum outside London, driving footfall is a challenge, so reaching out to a global audience to generate new revenue was an appealing element in the decision to create an app. The museum is in Cirencester, the UK&apos;s second largest Roman settlement after London. It (and the town) are blessed with an unrivalled collection of Roman artefacts, recognised and studied around the world, so the creation of an app was a logical step to combining the needs of the museum and its rich content. The idea was to provide the user with an enhanced tour around Roman Cirencester and the museum itself, as well as offer a learning zone, to fulfil the requirements of key stages 2 and 3 curriculum education. For schools in the local area, the museum is a key destination, but with a number of competitors for Roman-related content, providing a link between classroom, museum and the town was a important part of the process of creating the app. The app would enhance Roman studies in the classroom and also provide teachers with unrivalled access to the additional teaching resources provided. To scope the project and identify the best features we initially undertook some research. First, among two local schools \u2013 one primary and one secondary. Research included workshops with year 3 and year 7 pupils and teachers to establish what is was they wanted from a Romans app, and where and how they would use it. The responses contributed to the initial design stages of the app.     The Romans app    The second stage trialled the app with the same classes to gauge response, to see if it met their expectations and \u2013 importantly \u2013 whether they would use it. The results were staggering: 97% of primary and 98% of secondary school pupils said they would use the app. Key to the app&apos;s development, we also spoke extensively to local archaeologists involved in local excavations, to get their input. We also felt that to create a sense of atmosphere in the app, audio content delivered by the archaeologists would best communicate, in some cases, the very personal stories of the discoveries made during the excavations. What were the challenges? One was the volume and type of content that should be included and in what order. The key was to make sure that the content all linked together \u2013 from the museum, to the town and the learning zone. Once we decided on the structure it was then more of a logistical challenge to manage more than 700 different images and their variations for each device. Most of the artefacts were also re-shot so that their presentation inside the app could be consistent. Without a dedicated team managing this part of the process, it was the most challenging aspect. The app was launched in March 2013 following a successful pitch for funds to create it in September 2012. The app meets the objectives we set by allowing the museum to have an ongoing revenue stream available to them online. The recognition of this as a suitable and sustainable stream for the future has meant that planning is already underway to secure funding for the development of a second app for the medieval period. Creatively, and from the curator&apos;s perspective, it has allowed a new interpretation of the Roman collection, one different from the one currently available within the museum. It also allows the collection to go out across the globe with downloads already being made in Taiwan, Spain, Canada and the US \u2013 not bad reach from Cirencester!

Six months after China banned the soup from all official banquets, the price of fins has fallen by 20-30% in Hong Kong, Macau and other major fishing markets. Some specialist restaurants in Beijing have changed their menus or closed down, and airlines and hotel chains have stopped serving the soup. Meanwhile, in Europe, California and elsewhere, loopholes that allowed shark finning to continue have been closed. About 75m-100m sharks are thought to be killed each year for their fins, which are prized in Chinese culture for making the gelatinous yellow soup. The sharks are caught, their fins are sliced off and they are often thrown back into the ocean, where they die slowly. The mass slaughter has led to some shark populations declining by up to 98% in the last 15 years, and nearly one third of all ocean-going sharks are now on the internationally recognised red list of threatened species. The statistics are unreliable, but the latest Chinese ministry of commerce figures suggest a 70% fall in the consumption of shark fins in China in 2012-2013 and a 30% drop in exports to the Chinese mainland from Hong Kong in 2013. In addition, market prices for fins in Macau and other eastern ports that supply China with fish are 20-30% down on last year, according to the US conservation group WildAid. &quot;The tide may at last be turning,&quot; said Peter Knight, director of WildAid. &quot;We are getting lots of signals that attitudes are changing and prices are dropping because people no longer want to eat shark fin soup. &quot;At the same time there have been increased attempts by the Chinese government to combat the worst excesses of the exploding economic and industrial development.&quot; The global slaughter of sharks grew hugely in the 1990s as China&apos;s new middle classes developed a taste for what used to be a luxury soup served only to elites or at weddings and special occasions. At the peak of the mass slaughter, a bowl of shark fin soup cost up to $300 (\u00a3180) and a pair of shark fins could be sold for more than $700 a kilo \u2013 enough to encourage fishermen as far afield as Europe and Latin America to target the species. Nearly all shark fins end up in mainland China, Hong Kong or Taiwan. &quot;Biologically, sharks simply can&apos;t keep up with the current rate of exploitation and demand. Protective measures must be scaled up significantly in order to avoid further depletion and the possible extinction of many shark species,&quot; said Boris Worm, a marine biologist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He estimated last year that up to 100 million sharks were being killed a year. Sharks, which can live for 70 years, play a crucial ecological role in the world&apos;s oceans. As &quot;apex predators&quot;, they are at the top of the food pyramid. Without sharks to hunt second-level predators, it is thought that he whole ecosystem would become imbalanced, leading to the decline of fish stocks and even of coral reefs. Revulsion at the practice of finning has been steadily growing since China&apos;s best-known sports star, the basketball player Yao Ming, said on film in 2009 that he would no longer eat the soup. Yao used the slogan &quot;Mei yu mai mai, jiu mei yu sha hai&quot;, meaning &quot;when the buying stops, the killing can too&quot;. Campaigners report a generational divide emerging in China, with young people rejecting their parents&apos; symbols of success and status. A recent social media campaign in China attracted more than 350,000 pledges not to eat shark fin soup, mainly from young people. Yao&apos;s campaign is said to have helped to reduce consumption of shark fin soup and contributed to the Chinese government&apos;s decision to formally ban the soup from all state banquets, along with birds&apos; nests, other wild animal products, expensive cigarettes and alcohol. The new rules are intended &quot;to promote frugality, oppose extravagance and enhance the anti-corruption efforts among party and governmental authorities&quot;, said the official news agency, Xinhua. Global efforts to reduce rampant shark killing have included setting up marine parks and sanctuaries. Mexico, Honduras, the Maldives, the Marshall islands and other Pacific countries are in the process of establishing, or have already set up, large protected areas, and Britain has created the world&apos;s largest marine reserve around the Chagos islands. Last year the European Union brought in a regulation ending the practice of shark finning; in future, all EU boats will have to land sharks with their fins still attached. California last year banned the sale, possession, trade or distribution of shark fins. And New Zealand last week brought forward to October 2014 a complete ban on shark finning in its waters. But the Chinese official disapproval is expected to have the greatest effect on prices and consumption. Last week environmental groups said that they hoped that it marked a change in broader environmental attitudes. &quot;The regulation stems from a crackdown on corruption and lavish spending, but language in the notice acknowledges the importance of promoting green, eco-friendly and low-carbon consumption habits,&quot; said Joshua Reichert, a vice-president of the Pew charitable trusts. &quot;China has the potential to play a key role in helping to solve the problems of climate change, overfishing, pollution and conservation.

The Chinese government passed a law in October banning some types of organised overseas travel tours. These tours had contracts with popular overseas shopping outlets to take tourists to designated shopping centres, and the government stepped in to stop the practice. Tourism Australia said the drop could be attributed to the introduction of this policy. \u201cWe&apos;ve known about the tourism law for a while now and always knew that it would have implications, most particularly on the group tour market, when it came into force in October. And that&apos;s what I think we&apos;re seeing in these figures,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThe impact is not unique to the Australian market, with New Zealand and Asia reporting similar trends in their own Chinese arrivals.\u201d The chief executive of the Tourism and Transport Forum, Ken Morrison, said the decline in the number of Chinese visitors was only a short-term blip. \u201cWe see this as a case of short-term pain for mid-term gain, with the reforms aimed at ensuring Chinese visitors have a quality tourism experience that still represents good value and that they return home sharing their positive stories of Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite the monthly fall, Chinese arrivals are up 15.2 per cent for the year and we are confident Chinese visitors will respond positively to the changes and we will again see monthly growth from this critical source market.\u201d But the problem may be more serious than that. David Beirman, a senior tourism lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney, said the ban on shopping tours may not be the reason for the drop. Instead, he pointed to the broader competitiveness of the global tourism industry. \u201cShopping tours were a problem for tourists going to a number of destinations in other countries. \u201cI think what&apos;s happened is that everyone knows that China is the number one tourism market in the world and so everyone is trying to get in on it. Even though the Chinese market is continuing to go strongly, the competition is also continuing to grow.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/jan/17/architecture-holes-buildings-china-zaha-hadid-dubai", "publicationDate": "2014-01-17T12:29:28Z", "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "China", "Dubai", "Zaha Hadid", "Culture"], "sentences": ["The spiralling worm-hole     Swiss cheese &hellip; BIG's design for a technology centre in Taiwan features a spiraling public route cut through the building.", "Image: BIG    A 57m cube of Swiss cheese would be a fine thing to behold, and that seems to be what Bjarke Ingels and his merry band at BIG are aiming for with their proposal for a Technology, Entertainment &amp; Knowledge Centre, or TEK, in Taiwan."], "title": "Holey moley!

They push and punch and jostle in a densely packed scrum, their bodies crammed between fixed wooden benches. This picture captures the moment a brawl broke out in Ukraine&apos;s parliament. It is a dynamic image of one of the world&apos;s strangest bloodsports: parliamentary fighting. Scenes like this are surprisingly common inside legislative assemblies around the world. There was a previous bust-up in the Ukrainian parliament just 10 months ago. Georgia also saw a parliamentary fight recently, while chaotic scenes have been known to erupt in the parliaments of Taiwan, Somalia, Bolivia, Argentina and Nigeria. One of the biggest parliamentary fights, in India, looks on YouTube like a full-scale riot inside the national assembly, with members hurling microphones as non-participants flee the chamber. Aficionados of muscular politics enjoy these fights. They even collect images of them online. After the Labour MP Eric Joyce brawled in a bar at the House of Commons, political bloggers rated the best political fistfights. Does fighting disgrace an electoral assembly, or does it prove that politicians care about their beliefs? The picture from Ukraine&apos;s heated debating chamber communicates passion and intensity. These men appear to be fighting for their lives, not just a point of order. The anger they express with their bodies is \u2013 in a picture \u2013 more attractive than a moribund assembly where half-awake MPs debate a bill no one cares about. Might the occasional fist fight restore people&apos;s engagement with parliamentary politics in Britain? It is true the House of Commons is notoriously adversarial. Its critics are alienated by the rutting rivalry of leaders locked in ritual verbal conflict at prime minister&apos;s question time. But surely the problem is not the display of antipathy - it is the phoney feel of it all, as opposing parties score points like public school debaters. At least in the Ukraine they really mean it. No one in the scenes of this week&apos;s fight is striking a pose. Subsequent photographs of the episode show a man with real blood on his face. The point scoring exchanges of words that echo in the House of Commons all too often seem bloodless. Sometimes physical violence is \u2013 surely \u2013 the honest answer to weasel words. After the Bloody Sunday massacre in 1972 the home secretary, Reginald Maudling, supported the British paratroopers&apos; version of events in the House of Commons. Bernadette Devlin MP was not called by the Speaker, so she went up to Maudling and hit him. Yet for all the appeal of a parliamentary fight club that answers false rhetoric with spontaneous aggression (we now know Maudling was supporting an untrue version of events), it is of course a slippery slope to civil disaster. Parliaments exist to resolve disputes without violence. Their whole function is to replace fighting with words \u2013 and if the rhetoric rings hollow it needs to be infused with greater truth. A punch is not true eloquence, even if Devlin&apos;s came close. The passions at work in this picture from Ukraine&apos;s parliament are all too real and all too dangerous. As the pro-Russia policies of president Viktor Yanukovych push the opposition ever further into dissent, this fight broke out in a budget debate that was ended with a show of hands rather than the usual electronic vote: in the same session a measure was passed to criminalise activities related to public protest. In reality, fighting in parliament is quite likely to be a danger signal of a society splitting apart. This is apparent from one of the bloodiest fights ever seen in an electoral chamber, which took place in America in the 1850s. In 1856, Preston Brooks of South Carolina beat Charles Sumner unconscious with a cane in the Senate. Sumner&apos;s offence was to criticise Brooks for supporting slavery. This fight was a sign of things to come. Within a few years Americans would be killing Americans.

The database now discloses previously secret details of the owners of more than 100,000 offshore entities.   The ICIJ said the publication of the details, which it hopes will inspire further investigations and research, was in the interests of bringing accountability to the notoriously impenetrable offshore world.   \u201cSecrecy creates an environment where fraud, tax evasion, money laundering and other forms of corruption thrive.

Zhang Lifan, an independent scholar, told the\u00a0Associated Press that the use of offshore holdings by those with ties to officials gave a strong impression of privilege and impunity. Wen Yunchao, a well-known internet activist who now lives outside the mainland, said that while ordinary people might not fully understand the story, it was &quot;a major blow to the prestige of the authorities&quot;, pointing to the contrast with Xi&apos;s recent visit to a budget restaurant\u00a0where he mingled with ordinary citizens. The use of offshore structures can facilitate the avoidance of tax or the\u00a0moving of money overseas. However, offshore companies can also be an important tool for legitimate Chinese businesses, especially when operating overseas, due to restrictions and legislation in the country.

The FTSE 100 fell more than 100 points, or 1.6%, and the US Dow Jones dropped 1.2% as traders reacted to concerns that Argentina, Turkey, South Africa and several vulnerable Central American nations might be on the brink of a currency crisis. Political instability in Ukraine and the nose-diving Venezuelan economy added to the nervous atmosphere on exchanges, which have spent the last few weeks galloping ahead on the back of stronger growth forecasts in the US, UK and Japan. Central banks waded into the markets in an effort to stabilise currencies that were rapidly depreciating in an emerging markets selloff. In the wake of the collapse of the Argentine peso, which kickstarted the latest wave of selling, the Turkish lira hit record lows despite spending an estimated \u00a31bn to prop up the currency&apos;s value during the day. The rouble and the rand languished at levels not seen since the 2008-09 financial crisis. Some analysts blamed profligate government spending and corruption for the turmoil affecting some countries. Turkey is in the grip of a corruption investigation that has come close to the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, while Ukraine&apos;s president, Viktor Yanukovych, is facing violent protests that have spread from the capital, Kiev. Others blamed weakening demand for raw materials as the Chinese economy slows. The US recovery, which will attract investor funds previously parked in developing countries to earn a bigger return, is another destabilising factor. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: &quot;European markets fell flat on their faces as the emerging market currency rout continued, with the Argentine peso, Indian rupee, Turkish lira and South African rand all among the worst decliners, as economic growth concerns start to spread beyond China. &quot;With expectations rising that the Fed will continue to taper [quantitative easing] next week, de-risking is continuing to see capital flow into safer havens with gold, the Japanese yen and the US dollar the main gainers,&quot; he said. In Turkey, the central bank has refused to raise interest rates, even though the lira has fallen almost 9% this month, raising fears of mounting inflation and an exodus of investors. Despite a fire sale of about $1.65bn (\u00a31bn) to calm investors&apos; nerves, a move that removed almost a 10th of its reserves, the lira dropped almost 2%. RBS analysts said: &quot;The [Turkish central bank] simply does not have enough firepower to fight the pressure against the lira. It has now exhausted its &apos;no hike&apos; toolkit and its next major policy action will have to be a straightforward increase in the lending rate.&quot; The lira is only one of many currencies feeling the heat from investor worries. Central banks believed to have intervened to defend their currencies include India, Taiwan and Malaysia. Russia propped up the rouble after $350m in hard currency sales. Countries that have relied on huge inflows of investor funds over recent years also suffered in the jittery atmosphere.

Google loses again In AdWords patent infringement case &gt;&gt; Search Engine Lane  A judge has determined patent-holding company Vringo is entitled to additional royalties from Google in a patent infringement case involving Google AdWords. The order stems from a case brought by Vringo subsidiary I/P Engine in 2011 that claimed filtering technology used in Google AdWords violated two of its patents. A jury found in favor of I/P Engine, awarding it $30.4m and running royalty payments of 3.5%. The case is I/P Engine Inc. v. AOL Inc., 11cv512. Google claimed to have updated the AdWords system in May 2013 in such a way that the patents were no longer applicable and said it should not be subject to royalty payments after that point. In a Memorandum Order issued yesterday, U.S. District Judge\u00a0Raymond A Jackson disagreed writing, the modified version of AdWords &quot;is nothing more than a colorable variation of the infringing system.&quot; As such Vringo is &quot;entitled to ongoing royalties as long as Defendants continue to use the modified system.&quot;  1990s patents, previously used against Microsoft too. Samsung, Google strike wide-ranging patent cross-license deal &gt;&gt; Re/code  Samsung and Google have reached a broad deal to license one another&apos;s patents. The agreement, announced on Sunday, covers the two companies&apos; existing patents as well as those to be filed over the next 10 years. Samsung and Google didn&apos;t say whether the deal covers all of their respective patents. But they did say it extends beyond mobile, and covers multiple product categories. While noteworthy, Google and Samsung have already been largely on the same side of the global patent wars. Apple has focused its legal attention on Samsung rather than Google directly, though its arguments have sometimes centred on how Android is a copy of Apple&apos;s iPhone operating system. Nonetheless, both companies used the opportunity to highlight the deal as an example of choosing cooperation over litigation.  What hard drive should I buy? &gt;&gt; Backblaze Blog \u00bb  Because Backblaze has a history of openness, many readers expected more details in my previous posts. They asked what drive models work best and which last the longest. Given our experience with over 25,000 drives, they asked which ones are good enough that we would buy them again. In this post, I&apos;ll answer those questions.  Spoiler: Hitachi or Western Digital did the job (3-5% failure rate in three years). Seagate showed a 26.5% failure rate in three years). Three reasons why Ubuntu smartphone will succeed &gt;&gt; IntoMobile Dusan Belic:   This year we should see the first Ubuntu smartphone launched with demo devices most likely being on display at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. As far as we know, China&apos;s Meizu may be just one of the launch partners with more OEMs likely to join the party in no time at all. Here we want to explain why we think Ubuntu smartphone(s) will change the game for good.  Comment from Francisco Jeronimo, smartphones analyst at IDC: &quot;Unfortunately these are not strong enough. Lack of MOs [mobile operator] &amp; Vendor support, not strong value for common users &amp; need for big pockets of cash will impact Ubuntu Smp [smartphone] success.&quot; The one metric that matters most in Taiwan: non-PC Revenue &gt;&gt; DIGITS to DOLLARS Jonathan Greenberg has been hearing that Taiwanese manufacturers are most focussed on how they can increase the revenues they got from making things that aren&apos;t PCs:   In my work, I have always found visiting Greater China to be an important antidote to the Valley&apos;s echo chamber. It is one thing to write a blog post, it is quite another to run a mammoth manufacturing enterprise on that same basis. They supply chain tends to take a very &apos;grounded-in-reality&apos; approach to operations. This is not always to their benefit, but I like hearing both sides of perception. So I think there is more to this &apos;data&apos; than just another headline in on an ongoing theme.\u00a0 If, in fact, we are seeing the Taiwanese complex seriously disengage from building PCs, it will have important implications for the whole industry. As much as everyone in the Valley (and I am as guilty of this as anyone) has been prophesying the end of the PC era, PC sales are still very large. However, if the ODMs begin to disinvest in their PC production, we will likely see an acceleration of PC declines. The PC complex is built on steady increases in volume, and optimized for economies of scale. If the best minds and most-skilled engineers at the ODMs turn their efforts to other products, this will no longer hold true.

Apple has attempted to head off a sales slump by expanding in China, Japan and other countries. It recently struck a deal with China Mobile, the world&apos;s largest wireless network.  The company has also expanded its product range. Last November Apple introduced two new iPhone models instead of one, the cheaper 5c and more high end 5s, a first for the company. It is now reportedly considering scrapping the 5c and launching an iPhone with a larger screen, like many of it rivals. It also released two new iPads last year and added NTT Docomo as a carrier partner in Japan,\u00a0which helped fuel record sales up from 22.9 million last year. The company also sold 4.8 million Mac computers, up from 4.1 million last year.

As usual with these exercises, the government suggests three models for the new delivery company: it could be 100% state-owned, jointly owned by the state and a private partner, and wholly government owned but with its day-to-day responsibilities outsourced. With the third model clearly the bonkers option - a double layer of responsibility for an outsourcing contract is a recipe for blame-shifting and disaster - and the first too much like the status quo, the public-private partnership is clearly the favoured option. But what would a private partner bring to the necessarily monopoly business of land registration?   Privatising Land Registry would almost certainly be bad for open data. Tencent joins Android launcher trend &gt;&gt; Technode  We see Android launcher will be one of the hottest topics in China in 2014.

The most likely explanation here is a sudden slowdown in high-end sales in affluent markets like North America and Europe, possibly combined with a faster than expected mix shift towards cheaper models in emerging markets. We are now facing a genuinely fascinating March quarter. Is there a smartphone glut building globally? Will we see an escalation in price erosion as vendors fight for space in an industry that is not growing in the manner they expected? Things could get very exciting in coming months.

However, the agreement doesn&apos;t transfer ownership of patents and as a consequence won&apos;t allow Samsung to use Google&apos;s patents to defend itself in litigation with other companies such as Apple. Samsung and Google also didn&apos;t specify whether the scope of the deal was limited to Android, which currently powers about four of every five smartphones sold globally. The companies said that the agreement paves the way for deeper collaboration between Samsung and Google on research and development of current and future products.  The Motorola patents are covered as part of the licence. Quite what the point of the deal is (since there&apos;s not the slightest indication either was going to sue the other) isn&apos;t clear.

Strength in China alone cannot keep Apple in control.

This, combined with carrier moves towards transparent pricing (driven by a basis of competition shift in the US telecom industry), increased competition to &quot;unexpected&quot; levels. Therefore, even as the sales performance of the flagship iPhone 5S remained strong, Apple was losing potential buyers of its &quot;cheaper&quot; iPhones to &quot;good enough&quot; competitors. The combination of the iPhone&apos;s weak volumes and sudden spike in ASP confirm this fact.  Chinese New Year: Baidu tracks 1.3bn urban exodus &gt;&gt; BBC News  As billions of Chinese people prepare to celebrate the new year, social network Baidu - often referred to as &quot;China&apos;s Google&quot; - has been tracking the mass movement of people out of the country&apos;s cities and into the countryside.

The thicker, brighter lines are the busiest routes. An estimated 1.3 billion people make this kind of journey every year - with millions more travelling in from abroad to join the celebrations, which kick off on Friday.  Wow. Here is the map. Samsung cuts target notebook shipments to 7 million units for 2014  Samsung Electronics has set a goal of shipping 7m notebooks globally in 2014, a reduction of 41.67% from the 12m units shipped in 2013, and will no longer launch conventional notebook models except Chromebooks in 2015, according to Taiwan-based supply chain makers. Samsung aimed to ship 17m notebooks in 2013 but actually shipped 12m units, the sources said.  Possible pinch of salt (and Samsung may be feeling the effects, like LG, of the Korean government changing its policy on buying PCs). But that&apos;s a notable shift towards Chromebooks if correct.

Normal human beings who struggle with computers, even modern touch interfaces, would love the experience of workable voice interaction. People would connect with their phones on a visceral emotional level. If Google maintains their lead in voice, and voice interaction becomes as common as I expect, then Nexus Android becomes the de facto premium phone.

Watch out, Microsoft: Apple says iPad accounts for 90% of enterprise tablet activations &gt;&gt; GeekWire  Microsoft is aiming to protect its turf inside large businesses with the help of Windows tablets that run Office, but a new statistic demonstrates the size of the challenge facing the company. During Apple&apos;s quarterly earnings call this afternoon, CEO Tim Cook said that 90% of tablet activations in the enterprise are iPads, despite the features offered by the Microsoft Surface, as well as other tablets running Windows 8. In addition, Cook said that 98% of companies in the Fortune 500 are using iPads. Cook said he expects Apple to continue to grow in the enterprise. &quot;I think the road in enterprise is a longer one. The arc is longer than in consumer, which can immediately go out and buy things,&quot; he said. &quot;But\u00a0I think we&apos;ve done a lot of the ground work \u2026 and I would expect that it would have more and more payback in the future.&quot;  The race to buy the human brains behind deep learning machines &gt;&gt; Businessweek  &quot;DeepMind is bona fide in terms of its research capabilities and depth,&quot; says Peter Lee, who heads Microsoft Research.

Austin Ramzy, who has reported from the country for six years, is the third of the paper&apos;s staff not to receive a resident journalist visa since it ran a story on the wealth of the former premier Wen Jiabao&apos;s family in 2012. &quot;It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the authorities are punishing the New York Times [for the reports] \u2026 Such behaviour falls well short of international standards,&quot; the Foreign Correspondents&apos; Club of China (FCCC) said in a statement strongly regretting Ramzy&apos;s departure. A spokesman for the foreign ministry in Beijing said on Monday that Ramzy had broken visa rules. The FCCC described that as disingenuous, adding: &quot;The regulations are unclear and have not been applied to other journalists in similar situations to that of Ramzy.&quot; The departure of Ramzy, 39, comes amid increasing pressure on foreign media. Journalists were harassed and manhandled while covering the trials of members of the New Citizens Movement including Xu Zhiyong. Some had their press cards confiscated by police. The New York Times has not been able to gain accreditation for newly hired employees since the 2012 report. Its website has also been blocked since then, as has Bloomberg&apos;s since it reported on the wealth of President Xi Jinping&apos;s family earlier in the same year. The websites of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), the Guardian and several other major news organisations \u2013 including Le Monde, El Pa\u00eds and Sueddeutsche Zeitung \u2013 have been inaccessible from China since last week&apos;s publication of revelations about the offshore wealth of leaders&apos; families. The foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said Ramzy had violated regulations by not applying to amend his visa after handing back the press credentials he held for Time magazine. That visa expired at the end of last year; Qin said the ministry gave him a month&apos;s non-reporting visa on &quot;humanitarian&quot; grounds and was still processing his application. Ramzy&apos;s colleague Edward Wong wrote on Twitter: &quot;The NY Times, following rules, handed foreign ministry a visa application for Austin Ramzy last June. They have not approved it.&quot; A spokesperson for the paper said: &quot;We have been in regular contact with the foreign ministry since last summer about having Austin Ramzy transfer his accreditation from Time magazine to the New York Times. We have been seeking to adhere carefully to Chinese regulations on the transfer. We hope the authorities will work to resolve the matter without Austin being forced to relocate. It has been more than a year since another of our correspondents, Chris Buckley, was forced to leave Beijing while seeking to transfer his accreditation, and we are still working with the authorities to reunite him with his family.&quot; Buckley is currently in Hong Kong. Ramzy is expected to report from Taiwan in the immediate future. The Beijing bureau chief, Philip Pan, has also been waiting for accreditation for the New York Times since early 2012. Asked about Buckley and Pan&apos;s cases, Qin said determining who received visas was China&apos;s right as a sovereign nation. New York Times and Bloomberg journalists already accredited for those organisations had their visas renewed in the annual reapplication process this winter, but weeks after staff from other media. Visiting Beijing last month, the US vice-president, Joe Biden, said the US had &quot;profound disagreements&quot; with China over the treatment of American journalists and pressed the issue in talks with top leaders. In November, the Chinese government rejected a visa application by Paul Mooney, a US journalist who has worked in China for years and who had been hired by Thomson Reuters. It gave no reason for its decision. In 2012, Beijing expelled the al-Jazeera English correspondent Melissa Chan, refusing to renew her visa or grant a visa for a replacement.

Tian Lan, 55, and at least three others were seized by police in Tongzhou shortly after gathering outside the courthouse in support of the legal scholar, according to the Chinese Human Rights Defenders network (CHRD). Tian \u2013 a once-praised officer who became a protester and now detainee \u2013 is a vivid example of how swiftly people who never contemplated challenging authority can find themselves on the other side of the system. Earlier this week, the CHRD said three other activists - Xu Zhaojie, Zhao Guangjun and Mao Hengfeng - had also been taken by police following the trial of Xu, who has been sentenced to four years in prison for &quot;gathering a crowd to disturb public order&quot;. The charges against Xu related to small-scale, peaceful street protests by members of his New Citizens Movement calling for educational equality and for officials to declare their assets. It is not clear whether the others remain in custody, but Tian was still in a Chaoyang prison on Thursday morning, according to a friend.     Taiwanese rights activists display banners on Wednesday to demand the Taiwan president, Ma Ying-jeou, help Xu Zhiyong. Photograph: Sam Yeh/AFP/Getty Images    Earlier this month Tian told the Guardian that she was framed, jailed and forced to leave the police for blowing the whistle on a neighbouring district&apos;s officers. Her subsequent attempts to overturn the injustice transformed her attitude to protesters and petitioners, she said. &quot;Before, I thought they must have done something wrong or they wouldn&apos;t get embroiled in these cases. &quot;My experience totally changed my mind,&quot; she said. While Tian&apos;s case might sound like an anomaly, she said she was one of around 200 former officials from the police and justice system \u2013 including a judge \u2013 who are seeking redress after suffering because they revealed, or refused to go along with, wrongdoing by others. Tian, from Handan in Hebei, is the daughter of a military official from Shanxi and joined the police in 1985 after leaving the People&apos;s Liberation army. She won awards for her hard work and dedication. But in 2002 she was prosecuted and jailed. She said that her only offence was helping a boy whose father had been detained by police, who offered to release the man in exchange for a large bribe. She told a journalist, who wrote a story about the case. A month later she was detained, badly beaten and accused of offences including leaking national secrets, wrongly accusing others of crimes, duplicating official certificates and even bigamy - all of which she denied. Almost all the charges were dropped but she was not allowed to testify at her trial and was sentenced to a year in prison. Although her bosses had tried to support her they were outranked and her father&apos;s connections were also unable to help. &quot;I was expelled from the party, dismissed from police and lost all my rights. I tried to appeal to the senior courts but nobody cared,&quot; she said. &quot;After that I realised it is very hard for individuals to maintain their own rights or appeal to higher courts - there is a risk of being detained, beaten and suppressed again.&quot;     Protesters in Hong Kong object to Xu Zhiyong's jail sentence on Monday. Photograph: Vincent Yu/AP    Nicholas Bequelin, senior Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the &quot;sudden and painful discovery that there is basically no redress against official wrongdoing&quot;, which turned many people to protest or petitioning, could be particularly tough for &quot;people who may have had a degree of idealism in choosing their profession \u2013 like a policewoman who wanted to make a positive contribution&quot;. Tian said she and others hoped the central government could root out corruption in the police and judicial system. She praised Beijing&apos;s current drive against abuses, but added: &quot;At the local level it is hard to carry out because officials all have &apos;protective umbrellas&apos; \u2013 they bribe people to shield them.&quot; In general, said Tian, she and other former officials were treated much better than regular petitioners. When she and others protested outside one government building, staff came out to discuss their concerns and record the details, she said. &quot;They listen to us. Ordinary people just get taken away,&quot; she added. She said Beijing police had also been &quot;very sympathetic&quot; to her and other former officers, although police in her hometown had illegally detained her at sensitive times. But she seems to have hit the limits of tolerance with her courthouse protest. She did not mention the trial in her interview with the Guardian. An employee at the Chaoyang prison said she could not answer questions about Tian and referred calls to the Beijing public security bureau propaganda office, where calls were unanswered."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/31/china-denies-deporting-new-york-times-journalist", "publicationDate": "2014-01-31T14:37:27Z", "tags": ["China", "New York Times", "US news", "Obama administration", "Asia Pacific", "Media", "Newspapers"], "sentences": ["Austin Ramzy flew to Taiwan on Thursday after waiting more than six months for Beijing to issue him new accreditation as New York Times journalist and an accompanying visa."], "title": "China denies 'deporting' New York Times journalist Austin Ramzy", "article": "China has hit back at the US for criticising its handling of foreign media, denying it had forced a New York Times journalist to leave.  &quot;China expresses its displeasure. China does not accept the unjustifiable accusations by the US side, and demands the US side to respect facts and take cautious words and acts,&quot; said foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei in a statement carried by state news agency Xinhua. Austin Ramzy flew to Taiwan on Thursday after waiting more than six months for Beijing to issue him new accreditation as New York Times journalist and an accompanying visa. He had spent six years reporting on the mainland, most recently for Time magazine.  The New York Times has not been able to obtain visas for new employees since publishing a story about the wealth of then-premier Wen Jiabao in 2012. Other staff have experienced delays during the annual renewal of visas. The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said on Thursday the US was disappointed Ramzy had been forced to leave China because of visa delays and deeply concerned by restrictions faced by foreign journalists, \u201cincluding extended delays in processing journalist visas, restrictions on travel to certain locations deemed \u2018sensitive\u2019 by Chinese authorities and, in some cases, violence at the hands of local authorities&quot;. He said such treatment was in \u201cstark contrast\u201d to the way the US treated foreign media.  Some in the US have begun to press for reciprocity, arguing the government should exert pressure by denying visas to Chinese journalists.  Noting that US journalists had waited months or years for a decision on their credentials and visa, Carney said the administration had raised concerns about the treatment of foreign media \u201crepeatedly and at the highest levels\u201d. \u201cWe urge China to commit to timely visa and credentialing decisions for foreign journalists, unblock US media websites, and eliminate other restrictions that impede the ability of journalists to practice their profession,\u201d he added. The New York Times and Bloomberg websites have been blocked in China since running stories about the wealth of Wen and president Xi Jinping\u2019s families, respectively. Those of the Guardian, the International Consortium for Investigative Journalists and several other major news organisations have been inaccessible since publishing revelations about the offshore wealth of leaders&apos; families last week.  But Hong said Carney\u2019s statement \u201cdoes not accord with facts\u201d and that China followed its laws and regulations in dealing with foreign media.  He added: \u201cIt does not exist at all that Ramzy has been &apos;deported&apos; or &apos;forced&apos; to leave China.\u201d Ramzy handed back his accreditation for Time to the foreign ministry in May. Hong said the application for New York Times credentials \u201chas not been approved yet\u201d.  By failing to apply to change his visa type and residence permit while without press accreditation, Ramzy broke Chinese laws and regulations, he added. The Foreign Correspondents Club of China has described that argument as disingenuous, arguing that the rules were unclear and had not been applied to other journalists in similar situations to Ramzy. The visa Ramzy obtained while working for Time expired at the end of last year and he was given a 30-day non-working visa so he had time to arrange his departure - testifying to the way that China facilitated foreign journalists, Hong said. He said it would continue to welcome overseas media, adding: &quot;We also hope that foreign journalists observe Chinese laws and regulations and do news coverage in an objective and fair-minded way.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/06/supergroup-international-expansion-superdry-julian-dunkerton", "publicationDate": "2014-02-06T14:12:18Z", "tags": ["SuperGroup", "Retail industry", "Business"], "sentences": ["SuperGroup is to open dedicated web-stores in Taiwan and Australia in the next few months and is hoping to do the same in Korea as it shifts focus to international expansion this year."], "title": "SuperGroup shifts focus to international expansion", "article": "SuperGroup is to open dedicated web-stores in Taiwan and Australia in the next few months and is hoping to do the same in Korea as it shifts focus to international expansion this year. Julian Dunkerton, the chief executive, said 80% of about 90,000 sq ft of new space the young fashion company plans to open in its new financial year, which begins in April, would be overseas compared with just 20% last year. Germany will top the list after the company bought out its franchise partner and the company wants to buy out more franchise partners this year. Dunkerton said: &quot;Europe is where we really plan to take control. If we can bring agencies and distributors in house that&apos;s the preferred route of growth.&quot; However another 15 SuperDry franchise stores are set to open by the end of April, mainly in Europe, alongside as much as 10,000 sq ft of directly owned stores, taking the annual total close to 100,000 sq ft of new space this year. The plan comes as SuperGroup revealed a slowdown in underlying sales growth to 1.3% in the three months to 26 January compared to 7.8% in the previous quarter as it lapped strong sales in the previous year and cut back on selling discounted stock via eBay. The company, which is in recovery after a tricky time in 2011 and 2012, enjoyed a strong Christmas as Dunkerton said it had improved its clothing designs while sales of accessories such as bags, scarves and socks were particularly strong. Analysts said underlying sales growth for the quarter was below expectations of 3% but that a step up in the pace of new store openings and better wholesale sales, as well as a lift to profit margins from reduced discounting, meant the company was on track to meet profit expectations for the year of \u00a363m. Total sales rose 22% to \u00a3141.1m over the 13-week period. SuperDry is mixing high street with online expansion after seeing the pace of growth via the internet accelerate in the runup to Christmas. The company benefited from the general move to online shopping with sales rising particularly strongly in Germany and France. &quot;We are in the growth phase in both those countries and you can fight any economic conditions when you&apos;re taking market share,&quot; Dunkerton said. He added: &quot;One of the exciting things for the UK economy is that as a nation we are well advanced in our online shopping offer. We have a sophisticated online business which is well in advance of other nations and that is a huge opportunity for British brands, not just us.&quot; As well as the introduction of better delivery services, more sophisticated websites were giving shoppers more confidence in ordering online and this was extending the internet shopping period ahead of the important Christmas week by at least two days.

The decision highlights a problem that has begun to afflict smaller makers of Windows PCs, and even some of the big ones: as the global market for PCs shrinks, profits are fast\u00a0turning into losses. Ranjit Atwal, devices analyst at research firm Gartner, says there is a\u00a0shakeout coming. The PC market is dominated by five big companies \u2013 China&apos;s Lenovo, the American HP and Dell firms, and Taiwan&apos;s Acer and Asus. Together they ship 60% of the PCs sold globally a year. Apple has just over 5% of the market. That leaves about a third of the market for the smaller players, and far less of the profits. As the PC market has contracted over the past two years, from a peak of 361m in 2011 to 315m last year, it has become harder for smaller players to make a profit. Calculations based on financial results suggest that the average selling price of a PC made by the &quot;big five&quot; fell from $614 at the start of 2010 to $544 (\u00a3332) in the autumn of 2013. Profits per PC for those big five companies, though, have dropped from $15.71, or 2.6% of the selling price, to $14.87. That is not evenly spread: Asus is the most profitable, while Acer reportedly has made an operating loss for the past three quarters. And those five are the companies that build at real scale, shipping between 5m and 15m\u00a0units every quarter. Atwal ranks Toshiba, Samsung, Sony, and Fujitsu as the &quot;bottom four&quot; \u2013 together they had about 12% of the market last year \u2013 and as those most under pressure. &quot;They&apos;ve lost market share, and the market they&apos;re in has shrunk as well. Scale is everything in this market. If you haven&apos;t got economies of scale then the underlying costs of getting to market, retail and so on, is too great to be profitable,&quot; he said. Sony is instead turning to smartphones and tablets, which are growing, unlike the PC business. But even there the challenges are not small. Together, Apple and Samsung dominate both segments, and many other players are struggling to turn a profit. &quot;Sony will not be the last to say goodbye to PC hardware,&quot; says Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, in California. &quot;Those who survive will reap the rewards.&quot; Ironically, it is Apple, once the black sheep of the personal computer industry, which is now reaping those rewards. Despite its comparatively small share of the market, its machines are reckoned to collect the lion&apos;s share of the profits. Although Apple doesn&apos;t specify its PC profits, Horace Dediu, of the Asymco consultancy, believes the company maintains an operating profit of over 18%. On PCs selling at an average price of $1,230, that is $232 \u2013 more than 10 times that achieved by any other PC vendor."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/07/is-the-us-australia-anchor-of-peace-immune-from-rust", "publicationDate": "2014-02-07T04:11:47Z", "tags": ["Australia news", "Foreign policy", "US news", "Liberal party"], "sentences": ["A decade ago, the former Australian foreign minister, Alexander Downer, received a sharp rebuke from his American counterparts for suggesting that Australia\u2019s alliance commitments might not be triggered automatically by conflict over Taiwan."], "title": "Is the US-Australia 'anchor of peace' immune from rust? | Carl Ungerer", "article": "Most Australians view the bilateral relationship with the United States through the prism of a defence alliance \u2013 the ANZUS treaty. For over 60 years it\u2019s been seen as a security blanket, occasionally a nuclear umbrella, or just an insurance policy with our great and powerful friend. But what Australians sometimes forget is that Americans tend to be wary of alliances. Both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson warned the new Republic to resist getting bogged down in the problems of others. Friendships, yes. Entangling alliances, no. And so from 1776 to the second world war, the US managed to avoid signing a formal treaty alliance with anyone, except Panama. In the years since 1945, however, the US entered into treaties of alliance with over 50 countries. Among those, the ANZUS treaty, signed in September 1951 between Australia, New Zealand and the US, stands as a remarkable achievement in alliance durability. Like most of America\u2019s other alliance commitments, however, the ANZUS treaty was designed in a different historical context, for a different strategic problem, the Cold War. For Australian strategic planners, this raises an important question: how durable is the alliance now? The most recent communiqu\u00e9 from the annual ministerial talks between Canberra and Washington says it will remain \u201can anchor of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond\u201d. On her recent visit to Washington, foreign minister Julie Bishop described the alliance as \u201can indispensable instrument\u201d.  But in a period of transformational power shifts, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, concerns over the future of alliance solidarity are growing louder. These concerns range from the implications of budget restraints on burden sharing arrangements to the diverging interests of each alliance partner in relation to Asia\u2019s shifting balance of economic and military power. Judgements about the utility and longevity of alliances are as old as alliances themselves. And several academic studies have shown that the reliability of alliance commitments can\u2019t always be taken for granted. So, if alliances are not inevitable, and a different set of strategic pressures is changing the shape and direction of international and regional security, why do politicians on both sides of the Pacific assume that the \u201canchor of peace\u201d is immune from rust?  At a practical level, the constituent parts of the Australia-US alliance have never seemed stronger. A growing number of US marines are now on regular rotation for exercises throughout northern Australia, alliance cooperation has been extended to new non-traditional security threats such as cybersecurity and despite the fallout from the release of classified information by former US National Security Agency contractor, Edward Snowden, the depth and breadth of the intelligence relationship is unprecedented.  Over the next 15 years, however, the Australia-US relationship will confront a regional security environment that will be more competitive and less amenable to bilateral security agreements. The debate in Australia over what we should do about that has become polarised between the idea of a radical shift towards a new power-sharing arrangement between the US and China and the typical political response of \u201csteady as she goes\u201d. Between these two poles, some commentators have raised the possibility of a third pathway for the alliance, a strategy of containing China\u2019s ambitions until it becomes a more responsible stakeholder in the region\u2019s economic and security architecture. Strategies of concert, containment and complacency are useful fodder for the strategic policy community to chew over. But they tell us little about the specific issues that could go wrong in the bilateral relationship that would have potential consequences for the alliance. China will remain the most sensitive subject in the Australia-US relationship. A decade ago, the former Australian foreign minister, Alexander Downer, received a sharp rebuke from his American counterparts for suggesting that Australia\u2019s alliance commitments might not be triggered automatically by conflict over Taiwan. In what was an otherwise unremarkable statement of fact, the response from Washington suggested a divergence of views over what constitutes an alliance commitment. Richard Armitage\u2019s more recent warning about Australia free riding on American taxpayers is a reminder that Washington\u2019s alliance expectations are growing. Although the Australian government has agreed to increase the defence budget to 2% of GDP, achieving this goal at a time of fiscal stringency will be difficult, if not impossible, in the short term.  The 2013 Australian Defence White Paper made the bold assertion that  The government does not believe that Australia must choose between its longstanding Alliance with the United States and its expanding relationship with China; nor do the United States and China believe that we must make such a choice.  But choices will need to be made. Those choices will not be as simple as appeasing China or backing America\u2019s continued primacy in Asia. The challenge that China represents to the alliance is structural. Through coercion and intimidation, Beijing seeks to change the strategic equilibrium in Asia that has flourished under US leadership. China is not a status quo power, and the alliance is very much about maintaining the status quo. So one of these things will need to change. Another test for ANZUS is that domestic sentiment in the US about the value of military alliances is getting harder to judge. For now, isolationism remains a minor current in American politics - the mainstream of both major parties is committed to international engagement. However, the rise of the Tea party movement shows that the populist appeal of an isolationist sentiment could grow. And in an era of fiscal uncertainty, the pressure on defence, foreign policy and aid budgets will continue to make America\u2019s choices between home and abroad more difficult to make. One of the key challenges for both the US and Australia is to articulate more clearly the risks and rewards of the alliance relationship to their respective publics. Both Washington and Canberra cannot assume that the next generations will have the same appreciation of the historical and cultural ties that bound the post-War generations in alliance solidarity. A press release at the end of annual ministerial talks is a poor substitute for a more sustained and open dialogue with the public on the political, diplomatic and military value of the alliance. Failure to engage the public, in both countries, could see the alliance relegated to a historical artifact. Still friends? Of course. But an entangled alliance? Maybe not.

But Cameron brushed aside the criticism, saying: &quot;Sometimes we can forget just how big our reputation is, that the world over the letters &apos;UK&apos; stand for unique, brilliant, creative, eccentric, ingenious. We come as a brand \u2013 a powerful brand. &quot;Separating Scotland out of that brand would be like separating the waters of the river Tweed and the North Sea.

Seven months to do all we can to keep our United Kingdom as one. Seven months to save the most extraordinary country in history. &quot;And we must do whatever it takes.

Those voting are our friends, neighbours and family. &quot;You do have an influence. Get on the phone, get together, email, tweet, speak.

After setting out the moral, economic, geopolitical and diplomatic arguments against Scottish independence, Cameron said there was &quot;an emotional, patriotic case&quot; that traditionally reticent Brits, fearful of waving the flag, had been too reluctant to make. Alex Salmond, the Scottish first minister, accused him of being part of an &quot;out-of-touch Westminster elite&quot; and insisted an independent Scotland would maintain close ties with the rest of the UK. The SNP leader said: &quot;This speech was a threadbare defence of the case for Westminster Tories retaining their undemocratic control over Scotland, which betrays the utter weakness of the prime minister&apos;s case. &quot;David Cameron said he will &apos;fight with all he has&apos; against Scotland&apos;s independence \u2013 but that doesn&apos;t extend to having a head-to-head debate on the subject. &quot;If David Cameron is still not prepared to do that but continues to deliver lectures from London, people will draw their own conclusions from that.&quot; Cameron is aware that he is not the most persuasive voice in Scotland, but believes he cannot avoid the debate. He said: &quot;Some people have advised me to stay out of this issue \u2013 and not to get too sentimental about the UK,&quot; but added: &quot;I care far too much to stay out of it.&quot; Cameron drew on his Scottish blood, saying that while the Scottish root of his name meant &quot;crooked nose&quot;, the Cameron clan motto was &quot;let us unite&quot;. He said he would be making further speeches in Scotland and taking the cabinet to Scotland, and wanted to set out his belief that the UK family would be diminished if the Scots took the irreversible decision to leave. Trying to revive the patriotic spirit of the Olympics, he said: &quot;Sometimes we can forget just how big our reputation is, that the world over the letters &apos;UK&apos; stand for unique, brilliant, creative, eccentric, ingenious. We come as a brand \u2013 a powerful brand. Separating Scotland out of that brand would be like separating the waters of the river Tweed and the North Sea. If we lost Scotland, if the UK changed, we would rip the rug from under our own reputation. The plain fact is we matter more in the world together. &quot;Our reach is about much more than military might \u2013 it&apos;s about our music, film, TV, fashion. The UK is the soft power superpower: you get teenagers in Tokyo and Sydney listening to Emeli Sand\u00e9; people in Kazakhstan and Taiwan watching BBC exports like Sherlock, written by a Scot a hundred years ago, played by an Englishman today, and created for TV by a Scotsman.&quot; And he said he wanted his daughter to be able to read his favourite childhood book \u2013 HE Marshall&apos;s Our Island Story: A History of Britain for Boys and Girls from the Romans to Queen Victoria \u2013 which tells the &quot;great, world-beating story&quot; of the UK. He said: &quot;I passionately hope that my children will be able to teach their children the same \u2013 that the stamp on their passport is a mark of pride. That together, these islands really do stand for something more than the sum of our parts. &quot;This is our home \u2013 and I could not bear to see that home torn apart. I love this country. I love the United Kingdom and all it stands for and I will fight with all I have to keep us together.&quot; In a warning to people who have so far given the referendum debate little attention, he said: &quot;Centuries of history hang in the balance; a question mark hangs over the future of our United Kingdom. &quot;If people vote yes in September, then Scotland will become an independent country. There will be no going back.&quot; Cameron said for him the best thing about the Olympics &quot;wasn&apos;t the winning; it was the red, the white, the blue. It was the summer that patriotism came out of the shadows and into the sun. Everyone cheering as one for Team GB.&quot; He ended his speech with a plea to everyone in the UK to urge Scotland to stay: &quot;I want to be clear to everyone listening. There can be no complacency about the result of this referendum. The outcome is still up in the air and we have just seven months to go. Seven months to do all we can to keep our United Kingdom as one. Seven months to save the most extraordinary country in history. &quot;You do have an influence. Get on the phone, get together, email, tweet, speak. Let the message ring out from Manchester to Motherwell, from Pembrokeshire to Perth, from Belfast to Bute, from us to the people of Scotland \u2013 let the message be this: we want you to stay.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/feb/13/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2014-02-13T07:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "sentences": ["Taiwan suppliers concerned about competition from China in 2014 &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Since China-based supply chain players already achieved significant improvements in both product design and quality, many vendors have started turning to place their orders with these players.", "With consequent long-term implications for Taiwan&apos;s economy."], "title": "Boot up: Almunia row, Canada's open data win, mapping Sochi, and more", "article": "A burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Google&apos;s Almunia deal said to be criticized by EU officials &gt;&gt; Businessweek  European Union Antitrust Commissioner Joaquin Almunia&apos;s deal to resolve a three-year-old dispute with Google was criticized by two EU officials at a meeting today, according to two people familiar with the matter.

Swartz, Manning, and Snowden: when programmers scrape by &gt;&gt; The New Yorker Rusty Foster:   The difference between a &quot;crawler&quot; and a &quot;scraper&quot; is subtle, but typically a crawler is smarter about the links it follows, what it downloads, and what it leaves uncopied. For the most part, though, &quot;crawling&quot; is just scraping with a fancier name, and Google created one of the world&apos;s most valuable companies in part by being better at scraping than anyone else. Google was incorporated in 1998, and by 2002 its Web-scraping &quot;Googlebots&quot; were so ubiquitous and voracious that, in a short story titled &quot;Robot Exclusion Protocol,&quot; the programmer and writer Paul Ford imagined one trying to index his bathroom. Some have suggested that Google&apos;s recent acquisition of the smart-device maker Nest Labs is effectively an effort to scrape real-world data about our homes and lives, to add to the company&apos;s trove of information about us, which now includes information about the Web pages we visit, our e-mails, the books we read, our shopping habits, and more.  The short story is great. Why open data was the best $3m investment in Canada&apos;s 2014 budget &gt;&gt; Cantech Letter  If Open Data strikes you as long on concept, short on results, you need not leaves the confines of Canada to witness one of the best and most widely cited examples of its relevance. In 2010, public policy expert David Eaves described &quot;\u2026a well documented but little known story about how open data helped expose one of the biggest tax frauds in Canada&apos;s history.&quot; By accessing Canada Revenue Agency records, a colleague of Eaves discovered that the CRA was being duped by fake charitable receipts -in a big way. When all was said and done, it was revealed that sketchy charities were bilking Canadians out of a billion dollars a year. That was .6% of the entire annual budget of the Federal Government, notes Eaves.  Strange bedfellows: Microsoft could bring Android apps to Windows &gt;&gt; The Verge  Sources familiar with Microsoft&apos;s plans tell The Verge that the company is seriously considering allowing Android apps to run on both Windows and Windows Phone. While planning is ongoing and it&apos;s still early, we&apos;re told that some inside Microsoft favor the idea of simply enabling Android apps inside its Windows and Windows Phone Stores, while others believe it could lead to the death of the Windows platform altogether. The mixed (and strong) feelings internally highlight that Microsoft will need to be careful with any radical move.  Could Microsoft clone the Google Play APIs and intercept calls from apps on the phone and provide its own services? Trouble is, it would be forever playing catchup to Google. That&apos;s once you&apos;ve got past the problem of implementing the Dalvik VM on Windows Phone. Tablet hourly usage study: iPad dominates, Surface users more active during working hours &gt;&gt; Chitika The graph shows the iPad miles ahead, with Android tablets at a quarter of the use, and the Surface in the low single digits. However, there&apos;s also a &quot;normalised&quot; graph comparing each hour to its peak:   While no tablet experiences its volume peak during working hours, Microsoft Surface RT and 2 users generate a slightly greater share of their collective daily traffic between the hours of 12-5 p.m. ET as compared to iPad and Android tablet users. The results support the idea that Microsoft&apos;s tablets are generally used more frequently during working hours as compared to its major competitors in the space, but it&apos;s important to note the similarities in all three usage patterns, and that any differences in the precise online activities between user bases cannot be discerned from these data (e.g. e-mail, watching videos, etc.)  Chitika says the difference is statistically significant; the data (which applies to North America only) was collected over two weeks at the end of January 2014. It&apos;s also not split out to RT and Pro - which would have been useful to know. Are there really lots of vulnerable Apache web servers? &gt;&gt; Netcraft  The most recent security vulnerabilities affecting Apache were addressed in version 2.4.5, which included fixes for the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2013-1896 and CVE-2013-2249. Depending which Apache modules are installed, and how they are used, earlier versions may be vulnerable to unauthorised disclosure of information and disruption of service. The previous release in the 2.4 branch (2.4.4), also addressed  several cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in various modules; such vulnerabilities can severely compromise a web application by facilitating remote session hijacking and the theft of user credentials. Nonetheless, millions of websites still appear to be using vulnerable versions of Apache, including versions which are no longer supported.  TL:DR &quot;yes&quot;. At Sochi Olympics, crowdsourced OpenStreetMap trounces Google Maps &gt;&gt; Wired Science  If you&apos;re looking for detailed maps of the Olympic sites around Sochi, Google maps may not be your best bet. OpenStreetMap, the crowdsourced Wikipedia of cartography, looks to have much better coverage of the Olympic sites, as the images in this gallery show. The region outside Sochi where the Olympic ski and snowboard events will be held is virtually a pale green blank on Google maps, for example. The maps here come from the fun and fabulously time-sucking Map Compare tool on the website of Geofabrik, a German company developing commercial uses for OSM data. The Olympic park along the coast, and even downtown Sochi are also covered in more detail in OSM (although with some features that appear on one map but not the other, it&apos;s not clear which is more accurate \u2014 at least not without being there).  OpenStreetMap is a modern wonder. (Apple&apos;s map of the area is pretty much bereft of detail; Nokia HERE&apos;s is OK. Puzzling why Apple doesn&apos;t just take OSM&apos;s content outright.) Mobile phone market, excluding China, will see no growth this year &gt;&gt; Investors.com  Apple and Samsung continue to soak up all the industry&apos;s profits, [Tavis] McCourt [of analysts Raymond James] says. Apple claimed 87.4% of phone earnings before interest and taxes in the fourth quarter, he said. Samsung took in 32.2% of industry profits. Because their combined earnings were higher than the industry&apos;s total earnings as a result of many vendors losing money in Q4, Apple and Samsung mathematically accounted for more than 100% of the industry&apos;s earnings. A year ago, Apple accounted for 77.8% of mobile phone industry profits, followed by Samsung with 26.1%, McCourt said. &quot;It remains unclear to us where any non-Chinese vendor outside of Apple and Samsung will obtain the profits necessary to re-invest in the business,&quot; McCourt said. &quot;The mobile device market continues to look like an Apple and Samsung market in the developed world, with Chinese-based vendors continuing to take share in emerging markets.&quot;  The fourth-quarter total for Apple and Samsung comes to 103.9% in 2012 and 119.7% in 2013. Both companies&apos; profits in that period were roughly flat, so the rest of the business seems to be getting worse. Taiwan suppliers concerned about competition from China in 2014 &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Since China-based supply chain players already achieved significant improvements in both product design and quality, many vendors have started turning to place their orders with these players. China-based electronics manufacturing service (EMS) provider BYD is one of the players that has been aggressively striving for orders. In addition to smartphone orders from Nokia, Samsung Electronics, Huawei, BlackBerry and High-Tech Computer (HTC), the company has recently landed orders for Intel&apos;s education tablets, Acer&apos;s entry-level smartphone and Hewlett-Packard&apos;s (HP) tablets. Intel has also turned to promote China suppliers for component purchasing and has relatively improved these suppliers ability to land orders.

I don&apos;t believe that Microsoft intended to do that, but the company is by no means off the hook. After conducting my own research, running my own tests, and drawing upon nearly a decade of experience studying Chinese internet censorship, I have concluded that what several activists and journalists have described as censorship on Bing is actually what one might call &quot;second hand censorship&quot;. Basically, Microsoft failed to consider the consequences of blindly applying apolitical mathematical algorithms to politically manipulated and censored web content.  From my desk in Washington DC, when I enter terms into Bing in simplified Chinese (the written language used primarily in mainland China) on subjects the Chinese government censors heavily like &quot;Dalai Lama&quot;, the links I get from Bing are mainly from websites created and run from mainland China. In accordance to Chinese government requirements, they are all censored and skewed to favor the Chinese Communist Party&apos;s worldview. However when I enter &quot;Dalai Lama&quot; in traditional Chinese characters (used mainly in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other Chinese communities outside of mainland China) I get almost entirely non-mainland content including Tibetan exile websites and others supporting the Dalai Lama.  Then I search &quot;Dalai Lama&quot; in both simplified and traditional Chinese characters on Google. The results also differ for each because the traditional search favors content from Hong Kong and Taiwan. But Google&apos;s top simplified Chinese results nonetheless include links to websites created and operated by organizations based outside of China \u2013 like Wikipedia, Voice of America and exiled Tibetan organizations. Search algorithms are indeed complicated and no company gives away its &quot;secret sauce&quot;. But they all rely heavily on the number of inbound links to a website as well as its &quot;click through&quot; traffic numbers. The reality is that due to the massive size of China&apos;s internet users, incoming links and click-throughs for the most popular mainland-based websites can be orders of magnitude greater than some the most popular websites in North America and western Europe. Websites contradicting the CCP&apos;s worldview tend to be blocked in mainland China, which means that the number of people clicking through to simplified Chinese language websites based outside of China is inevitably lower. The algorithm deployed by Bing may be mathematically sound, but it fails to protect online freedom of expression. Bing failed to take into account the political reality of Chinese government censorship and its broader impact on the shape of the Chinese internet. Without adjustments to how simplified Chinese websites based outside of mainland China are &quot;weighted,&quot; exiled and dissident online voices inevitably lose out. Put it another way: an apolitical mathematical formula automatically amplifies Chinese government censorship to all people searching for simplified Chinese content anywhere in the world, not just in China.  Google apparently identified this problem some years ago and found a solution. Most likely that solution involved some mathematical means of compensating for the traffic imbalance between websites located inside mainland China (with critical content deleted) and those simplified Chinese websites based outside of China that are blocked \u2013 and thus denied the same levels of traffic and links from China&apos;s nearly 600 million internet users. It&apos;s not clear why Microsoft didn&apos;t take the problem more seriously when it was first identified in 2009 by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof. Microsoft claimed then that it was working to address what it described as technical issues. One charitable theory might be that its engineers got busy with other priorities and their managers forgot to follow up, and no reporters or activists reminded them about the problem again \u2013 until now. As a member of the Global Network Initiative, Microsoft has made clear commitments to freedom of expression and privacy. It just underwent an assessment certifying that it has put policies and practices in place to respect users&apos; rights. It is part of a coalition fighting hard against the NSA&apos;s abuse of surveillance powers. It recently overhauled the way that Skype works in China to boost user privacy protections. For now, I am giving the company the benefit of the doubt. But if Microsoft wants people to believe its denials of active censorship, it must be more transparent about how Bing interacts with governments. A first step would be to follow Google&apos;s example and publish a &quot;Transparency Report&quot; with data on the number of government censorship requests Bing receives \u2013 and complies with \u2013 around the world. Even more urgently, Bing must bring its technical systems and algorithms into better alignment with Microsoft&apos;s human rights commitments."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/18/lin-hwai-min-cloud-gate-dance-theatre-rice", "publicationDate": "2014-02-18T09:41:00Z", "tags": ["Cloud Gate Dance Theatre", "Dance", "Stage", "Culture", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["My father&apos;s family come from the village of Chiayi in Taiwan, where I spent a lot of my childhood.", "In 1978 I created a work for my company, Cloud Gate Dance Theatre, entitled Legacy, which depicted the pioneers of Taiwan and looked at the planting and harvesting of rice.", "From 1895 to 1945 Taiwan was occupied and ruled by Japan.", "\u2022 Cloud Gate Dance Theatre of Taiwan perform Nine Songs and Rice at Sadler&apos;s Wells, London, from 21 to 27 February 2014"], "title": "Grain of truth: Lin Hwai-min on Cloud Gate Dance Theatre's Rice", "article": "My father&apos;s family come from the village of Chiayi in Taiwan, where I spent a lot of my childhood. The rice field in that valley was immense and beautiful - it looked like a giant wave of rice. As children we&apos;d roll around in the field. After harvest, the farmers would spread out their rice grains in an empty space in the courtyard. We loved to mess around with it. Pretty often we&apos;d get caught and were beaten up. Rice is something you take for granted but is so precious. I grew up right after the second world war and at that time parents would demand of their children that not a single grain of rice be left in the bowl.            In 1978 I created a work for my company, Cloud Gate Dance Theatre, entitled Legacy, which depicted the pioneers of Taiwan and looked at the planting and harvesting of rice. In 1994 I made Songs of the Wanderers, for which I used three and a half tonnes of rice grains dyed gold. They served as the only set - they were used from backstage and from above, showering the stage. I never thought I would go back to this subject. But here we are. My new work? It&apos;s called Rice. A lady in my office says I have a rice complex. From 1895 to 1945 Taiwan was occupied and ruled by Japan. During this time the farmers in the Chihshang region were ordered to grow rice for the imperial family. But the emperor&apos;s rice lost its reputation for quality after the war because the farmers began to use chemicals. Since the 1990s the farmers have been farming organically \u2013 they care more about the environment. In that village you don&apos;t see a single electricity pole in the field.            I visited the region in 2011 and wasn&apos;t prepared for its great beauty. When we were creating Rice we took part in the harvesting in Chihshang. We got up at 5am and went out to the fields. It was a back-breaking experience. But we got in touch with the wind and the sun, the drizzle of rain and the mud and the soil. You can create work in a studio but the elements of nature stimulate you physically. You press down into the ground and draw energy from gravity. You feel a sense of power from pushing into the soil with your feet. It was a wonderful experience and gave us a new perspective: it&apos;s not just dancing, dancing, dancing in the studio. Throughout the show we use a lot of projections: rice grains swaying in the wind; fire when the farmers burn the remainders of the field before the next season; water slowly filtering into the earth and bringing forth a new beginning. It&apos;s a bright and warm show. In the show I use folk songs in the Hakka dialect alongside music by Maria Callas. They are farmers&apos; folk songs about the basics of life and about love. Nowadays machines do the hard work, but these are the tunes that were once sung when the rice was being planted \u2013 you would hear the words carrying across the fields. \u2022 Cloud Gate Dance Theatre of Taiwan perform Nine Songs and Rice at Sadler&apos;s Wells, London, from 21 to 27 February 2014"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/21/pentagon-plays-down-navy-assessment-of-short-sharp-china-japan-war", "publicationDate": "2014-02-21T09:29:51Z", "tags": ["Dalai Lama", "Obama administration", "China", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["Fanell said China was expanding training for its navy beyond the \u201clongstanding task to restore Taiwan to the mainland ...

Obama\u2019s announcement of a midmorning session with the Dalai Lama was sure to draw a reprimand from China, which views him as a violent separatist because he seeks more autonomy for Tibet. In its announcement the White House said the Dalai Lama was \u201can internationally respected religious and cultural leader\u201d and noted Obama had met with him twice before, in February 2010 and July 2011.  In what appears to be a small concession to the Chinese, Obama will see the Dalai Lama in the White House Map Room, a historically important place but of less significance than the Oval Office, the president\u2019s inner sanctum.  A senior Chinese official vowed this week to ignore foreign pressure on human rights and said foreign leaders who meet with the Dalai Lama should \u201cpay a price\u201d for it. The United States recognised Tibet as part of China and did not support Tibetan independence but supported the Dalai Lama\u2019s pleas for more autonomy, said Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House national security council. \u201cWe are concerned about continuing tensions and the deteriorating human rights situation in Tibetan areas of China,\u201d Hayden said. As tensions remain strained between the US and China, the Pentagon has hastily played down remarks by a senior navy intelligence officer that Beijing might be preparing its forces for a \u201cshort, sharp\u201d war with Japan in the East China Sea. The comments by Captain James Fanell, director of intelligence and information operations at the US Pacific fleet, were made at a conference on maritime strategy called West 2014 in San Diego. Fanell also predicted China \u2013 which declared an air defence zone last year in the East China Sea where it is in a territorial dispute with Japan over a string of small islands \u2013 would declare another such zone by the end of 2015, this time in the South China Sea. Fanell said China was expanding training for its navy beyond the \u201clongstanding task to restore Taiwan to the mainland ... We witnessed the massive amphibious and cross military region exercise, Mission Action 2013, and concluded that the PLA [People\u2019s Liberation Army] has been given a new task: to be able to conduct a short, sharp war to destroy Japanese forces in the East China Sea,\u201d he said. He added that such a war could be expected to be followed by a seizure of the islands at the heart of China\u2019s territorial dispute with Japan. The islands are known as the Senkaku by Japan and the Diaoyu by China. The Pentagon\u2019s top spokesman, Rear Admiral John Kirby, declined to comment on whether it was appropriate for Fanell to publicly offer such a blunt assessment but said the Pentagon wanted closer ties with China\u2019s military. \u201cThose were his views to express,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cWhat I can tell you about what Secretary Hagel believes is that we all continue to believe that the peaceful, prosperous rise of China is a good thing for the region, for the world,\u201d he said, referring to defence secretary Chuck Hagel. Asked whether the Pentagon shared Fanell\u2019s assessments, Kirby said it would be inappropriate for him to speak to the intentions or motivations of another country\u2019s military. \u201cIt\u2019s for China to speak to China\u2019s intentions and motivations and their relations with their neighbours. And nothing\u2019s changed about our view here,\u201d Kirby said. Ties between China and US ally Japan have worsened due in part to mistrust over China\u2019s military buildup and their territorial dispute in the East China Sea. The US military has refused to recognise the air defence zone China declared last year. Some US officials have warned that any declaration by Beijing of another such zone in the South China Sea could result in changes to US military deployments in the region.On Friday the US army chief met with top Chinese generals in Beijing as part of efforts to build trust between the two nation\u2019s militaries.

HEROnymous bosh and other lame storylines The hoodie with a beef against Claire storyline wasn&apos;t the only one in this episode that left me feeling that the makers had taken receipt of a big consignment of daft and were offloading it on us as fast as possible before they got arrested for crimes against TV. If there was an Emmy for Most Airtime Spent Unfolding Hitchcockian MacGuffin, House of Cards would win hands down. Are the Chinese going to shoot up dear old Yonaguni and unleash armageddon? Seems unlikely. The episode was bookended with two scenes featuring Gavin Orsay, the lone hacker freak from central casting with the sub-Assange online handle HEROnymous and an uncanny resemblance to Thom Yorke. He was tracking naughty Doug Stamper by means of GPS. &quot;Bad boy,&quot; said Orsay, as the henchman&apos;s car rolled away from the apartment of the woman he unrequitedly adores, callgirl turned unconvincing born-again Christian lesbian Rachel Posner. Orsay stared with insane glee at his screen and stroked his guinea pig, Cashew, in defiance of the manifest truth that, since Mike Myers as Dr Evil stroked his cat Mr Bigglesworth in the Austin Powers films, no one can stroke a pet in a TV or film and expect to be taken seriously. And yet we were supposed to take this po-faced scene, with its tempestuous incidental music, as portending a Very Serious Plot Development Indeed. I don&apos;t mind House of Cards being funny, but unwittingly so? Puh-lease. Run that by me again? \u2022 &quot;I have always loathed the necessity of sleep.

Hong Kong&apos;s domestic workers have few places to meet on their only day off; many have huddled under flyovers to stay dry as they chat to friends. But this group is grinning as they brave the downpour. Some are barefoot in the puddles as they dance in plastic raincoats, twisting left to right and raising their hands to the heavens. &quot;Women united will never be divided! Migrants united will never be divided!&quot; chant women in hijab, dipping and turning alongside others in hot pants. &quot;With this kind of solidarity, people can be heard,&quot; said Eni Lestari, chair of the International Migrant Workers Alliance, as she surveyed the rally. &quot;More and more people are speaking out. But in terms of conditions, it&apos;s not getting better.&quot; The numbers of foreign domestic helpers, overwhelmingly female, have soared across the Asia-Pacific region. In 1992, Hong Kong had slightly more than 100,000; now there are three times as many. Malaysia has 125,000; in Thailand, 88,000 were registered in 2010. But the true numbers are thought to be far higher for all three. The Filipino and Indonesian diaspora have been joined by Burmese, Nepalese and Cambodian workers. But the flow of migrants, and their growing voice, has far outpaced their progress in winning protections. Reports of exploitation by employers and agencies are rife; rights are limited. While Singapore recently introduced a statutory weekly day off, campaigners say it is not being adequately enforced and employers can legally avoid granting it by increasing pay. Migrants in Taiwan have been fighting for the same right, without success. The One Billion Rising event in Hong Kong \u2013 one of many worldwide demanding an end to violence against women \u2013 had a particular resonance for the domestic workers who organised and participated in it. Recent allegations of abuse have spurred a fresh push for improved conditions and rights. In September, a judge jailed a couple who had tortured and beaten their maid with a bicycle chain. Last month, Erwiana Sulistyaningsih returned home to Indonesia with extensive injuries and reportedly weighing less than four stone (25kg). Her employer has since been charged with wounding, common assault and criminal intimidation. Lestari, who is from Indonesia, knows from experience how vulnerable and isolated workers can be. She said her first employers did not give her a single day off in four months; paid her only half her promised wages; insisted she eat pork despite her being Muslim; and banned her from talking to people outside the house. &quot;I didn&apos;t know where the consulate was; I didn&apos;t know the immigration department; my passport was kept by the agency. I ran away and an NGO helped me to find shelter,&quot; she said. First she learned about her rights; then she shared her new knowledge with others. As an Indonesian worker, she credits Filipino women \u2013 who came to Hong Kong earlier \u2013 for helping teach later arrivals how to organise. Social media ensures that information spreads fast, particularly since domestic workers are unusually dependent on their mobile phones for communication with the outside world. Improved awareness of their rights enables them to challenge unfair treatment. But &quot;our problem is not simply bad employers, but bad policies&quot;, Lestari said. Domestic workers&apos; organisations, and the new HK Helpers campaign supporting them, are seeking to end abuses by agencies who charge fees of as much as HKD$21,000 (\u00a31,620) and confiscate workers&apos; documents. The legal maximum is around HKD$400. They also want maximum working hours legislation and an end to the &quot;two-week rule&quot; \u2013 giving workers just a fortnight to leave Hong Kong when their employment ends \u2013 and the insistence they live with their employer. Those regulations, say activists, make it harder to leave an abusive situation \u2013 especially if helpers have large debts to repay to the agency that placed them. But even when workers speak out, officials in home and host countries turn a blind eye to problems because of migration&apos;s economic benefits, said Norma Kang Muico, Asia-Pacific migrant rights researcher for Amnesty International. &quot;Authorities disregard them because they are not voters and have no right to abode.&quot; Domestic workers are specifically excluded from legislation allowing foreign nationals to gain permanent residency after living in Hong Kong for seven years. A legal challenge to their exclusion was rejected by the special autonomous region&apos;s highest court last year. Mark Daly, the solicitor who represented the workers, said the case brought to the surface &quot;the divide between those believing in a multicultural society based on respect and dignity and those believing that you can have second-class citizens \u2026 Regrettably, Hong Kong society is slow to change attitudes and I think the HKSAR government is disappointing in this respect.&quot; Joseph Law, founder of the Hong Kong Employers of Domestic Helpers Association, accused foreign critics of failing to understand local conditions and of seeing themselves as saviours. He said he was angered by the focus being on claims of violence and insisted problems were &quot;individual and isolated&quot;. However, in a 2012 survey of 3,000 domestic workers in Hong Kong, 58% reported verbal abuse, 18% physical and 6% sexual. Law&apos;s association rejects limits on the numbers of foreign domestic workers, but also objects to them being given permanent residence. &quot;They might want to work in other places and live separately. Domestic workers are what we need,&quot; he said. Lestari said it was time for Hong Kong to recognise the true contribution made by helpers. &quot;We free up family members to contribute to development. Fifty percent of our income goes here: food, clothing, transport, phone bills. We enrich Hong Kong culture because we have brought our culture and helped make it a vibrant international city. But they are boxing us in,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s not only discrimination \u2013 it&apos;s social exclusion.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 7 March 2014 because the original described Mark Daly as the barrister who represented the workers in court.

Currently it can take a year before Australia gives the final green light. \u201cThis is a very good thing to make it easier for families to adopt from overseas,\u201d prime minister Tony Abbott said. \u201cKids without parents go to parents without kids. It\u2019s a win-win situation. At the moment, if you adopt from those countries you not only have court processes overseas, you\u2019ve got court processes here in Australia.\u201d The Ethiopian intercountry adoption program was permanently closed in June 2012 by the attorney general at the time, Nicola Roxon. It will remain closed but the families who had been approved and were waiting for the adoption to be finalised will have their adoptions recognised in Australia. Abbott said the changes would make it \u201cmuch easier\u201d for the families who had been stuck in limbo. At least seven families were waiting for their adoptions to be finalised when the program was closed, according to the Australian, though the Labor party initially said there were no adoptions in the pipeline at the time. A spokeswoman for the prime minister\u2019s office said it was aware of three families in the program who were definitely eligible to have their adoptions finalised. South Korea and Taiwan are not signatories to the Hague convention, so instead of having their adoption recognised immediately under Australian law parents need to get an adoption order in Australia. Under the changes, the adoptions will be recognised automatically and the citizenship process will begin as soon as the child arrives in Australia. Actor Deborra-Lee Furness, the founder of the organisation Adoption Awareness, has been campaigning for changes to Australia\u2019s adoption laws to make it easier to adopt. The prime minister\u2019s office contacted her on Monday to let her know about the proposed changes. \u201cYes, I gather she is quite excited,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cLook, for dozens and dozens of families this is very, very good news because what could be better than giving an orphan child the love of parents?

For others, Crufts \u2013 the world&apos;s most famous dog show \u2013 is an all-consuming passion. Winning matters. Gary Waters, from Ashford, Kent, probably falls into the first category. &quot;It&apos;s not too serious for us,&quot; he said as he guided Chubby, his impressively shaggy komondor (a mop-haired breed formerly used by nomadic herdsmen to guard livestock in Hungary) to the bench that was to be his home from home for the day. Chubby was wearing a blue cagoule stitched together by Gary&apos;s wife, Anita. &quot;There are only two dogs in his category so he&apos;s got a good chance of winning anyway. But we enjoy coming here, having a laugh with our mates. Winning isn&apos;t the most important thing for us.&quot; Over at ring 15, however, Bill Britton was not feeling so jolly. He was pleased with the performance of his two Australian cattle dogs, combative creatures with dingo blood in them, but was unimpressed with the appearance of a professional Italian handler, who had helped a dog rejoicing in the name Banana Bender the Governor, take best dog prize. &quot;It&apos;s not quite right,&quot; said Britton. &quot;The owner has an unfair advantage because a professional handler knows how to hide the defects of the dog. He can make an average dog look much better. It&apos;s not cheating of course, but to my mind it&apos;s not quite honest. And I don&apos;t like his green shoes either.&quot; Britton&apos;s concerns notwithstanding, Crufts, which began on Thursday and runs for four days at the NEC in Birmingham, was buzzing.     A Saint Bernard is put through its paces at Crufts 2014. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    According to the Kennel Club, which organises the show, more than 21,500 dogs are competing, 5% more than last year. Of those, 2,500 dogs have been brought to the West Midlands from overseas. There are competitors here from more than 45 countries, including Bermuda, Japan, Taiwan, Israel, Guatemala and Azerbaijan. The show is an extraordinary assault on the senses, not all of them pleasant. This is not the place to be if you don&apos;t like the sound of barking, yapping or growling. Sadly, not all the dogs make it to the fenced-off sawdust-strewn doggy toilets at the edges of the halls. Walk too close to a Newfoundland and you risk being slobbered all over (the club stand sells slobber towels for \u00a33.50 and handmade dog bibs for \u00a310). The show, which was first staged in 1891, is not without its detractors, with animal rights campaigners claiming that it is a celebration of looks rather than health. The RSPCA is running a campaign named Born to Suffer, calling on the Kennel Club&apos;s breed standards to be reviewed by a panel of independent experts so they prioritise the health, welfare and temperament over their appearance. It raises concerns about dogs that are bred to have short, flat faces such as pugs or bulldogs or very wrinkled skin such as basset hounds, saying this can cause then pain and suffering. The US campaign group Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) goes further, branding Crufts a &quot;grotesque charade&quot; and claiming some breeds can barely breathe or mate unaided. After welfare concerns were voiced, the BBC, which began televising Crufts in 1950, dropped out, and Channel 4 and More4 have taken over broadcast rights. It is promising to put health and welfare issues at the centre of its coverage. The chairman of the Kennel Club, Steve Dean, said an important part of Crufts was the promotion of happy and healthy dogs. The club is launching a scheme this year called Estimated Breeding Values aimed at helping breeders evaluate genetic risk more accurately. During this year&apos;s show the club&apos;s charitable trust is also giving \u00a31.6m to the Kennel Club Genetics Centre.

Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    The Kennel Club also emphasises that the show is not all about the pedigree competitions. It is running &quot;Scrufts&quot;, celebrating crossbreed dogs with good stories, such as Wylie, a dog rescued by British troops in Afghanistan after he had had his ears cut off, been stabbed and run over. But the headline-grabbers are those purebreds. Such as Nickolay Kuryliov&apos;s snowy white samoyed dogs (whose coats were going frizzy because of the rain), who had flown in from St Petersburg with him. &quot;It&apos;s my first time here, it&apos;s a wonderful atmosphere,&quot; said Kuryliov. Emma Herring, who was keeping her mastiffs Hovis and Treacle occupied as they waited for their moment in the spotlight, said it had felt like she had travelled from abroad \u2013 though in fact it was only Norfolk. &quot;We had to get up at 3am. We must be mad.&quot; Arguably, the real heroes of Crufts are the cleaners who patrol the halls hauling wheelie bins filled with detergent and who have the unenviable task of cleaning up after the pooches who did not reach the sawdust. &quot;This is my worst four days of the year,&quot; said one (who asked not to be named). &quot;I much prefer the caravan show, many fewer little accidents.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/08/malaysia-airlines-plane-mh370-kuala-lumpur-beijing-boeing-777", "publicationDate": "2014-03-08T10:58:43Z", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "Malaysia", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China", "Vietnam", "Airline industry", "Business", "Air transport"], "sentences": ["The other travellers included 38 Malaysians, seven Indonesians, and six Australians as well as passengers from India, France, the US, New Zealand, Ukraine, Canada, Russia, Italy, Taiwan, the Netherlands and Austria."], "title": "Malaysia Airlines plane vanishes from radar screens", "article": "Almost 240 people are missing after a Malaysian Airlines flight en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing vanished from radar screens in the early hours of Saturday.

Ships and aircraft from China and the Philippines were also on their way to help. Two infants were among the 227 passengers, more than 150 of whom were Chinese nationals. Twelve crew were on board.

We are doing everything we can to ensure every possible angle has been addressed,&quot; Hishamuddin Hussein told reporters near Kuala Lumpur International airport. He said the Malaysian military was awaiting information from Vietnamese counterparts. Malaysian naval vessels saw no immediate sign of wreckage when they reached the area off the country&apos;s north-east coast where the flight last made contact, a senior rescue official told Reuters. China&apos;s state news agency, Xinhua, said President Xi Jinping had urged officials to strengthen contacts with their counterparts in Malaysia and other countries and take all necessary measures for any emergency treatment needed. He had also ordered the Ministry of Transportation and the Civil Aviation Administration to enhance security checks to ensure the &quot;absolute safety&quot; of domestic operations. &quot;We are extremely worried,&quot; China&apos;s foreign minister, Wang Yi, told reporters in Beijing. &quot;The news is very disturbing.&quot; Fuad Sharuji, Malaysia Airlines&apos; vice-president of operations control, told CNN the plane had been flying at an altitude of 35,000 feet (10,670 metres) and that the pilots had reported no problems. Analysts said it was highly unusual to lose a flight without any previous indication it was experiencing difficulties \u2013 although an Air France flight that crashed into the South Atlantic in 2009, killing all 228 people on board, had never issued a distress call. The plane is a Boeing 777-200, which aviation experts said has a strong safety record. One crash-landed in San Francisco in July last year, killing three passengers and injuring more than 180, but the crash investigation, which is ongoing, has so far indicated no mechanical failure and focused on the pilots&apos; failure to recognise that the plane was flying too low and too slow as it approached the runway. Boeing said via Twitter that its thoughts were with all on board and their families. Malaysia Airlines is also regarded as having a strong safety record. Its last major incident was in 1995, when 34 people died after a plane crashed in the Malaysian city of Tawau. The flight was operating as a China Southern Airlines codeshare. In a statement on Saturday afternoon, Malaysia Airlines wrote: &quot;We are currently working with international authorities on the search and rescue mission and as at 1400 hours, 08 March 2014, we have no information on the location of the airline. &quot;Our thoughts and prayers are with all passengers, our crew and their family members.&quot;     This screengrab from flightradar24, a flight tracker that shows live air traffic from around the world, shows the last reported position of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 Photograph: AP    Confusion surrounds the point at which the flight lost contact. In a statement, Malaysian Airlines&apos; chief executive, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, said it was in contact with air traffic controllers until around two hours into the flight, at a point 120 nautical miles off the east coast of the Malaysian town of Kota Bharu. Other sources suggested that was an error. Flight tracking website FlightAware showed the plane flying north-east over Malaysia after takeoff and climbing to 35,000ft. The flight vanished from the website&apos;s tracking records a minute later, 20 minutes after it took off. Twenty minutes after that, while flying over the sea between Malaysia and Ho Chi Minh city, the plane failed to check in as scheduled, an official at the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV) said. In a separate statement, Lieutenant General Vo Van Tuan, deputy chief of staff of the Vietnamese army, said the flight &quot;lost all contact and radar signal one minute before it entered Vietnam&apos;s air traffic control&quot;. Pham Hien, a Vietnamese search and rescue official, said the last signal was detected 120 nautical miles south-west of Vietnam&apos;s Ca Mau province, close to where the South China Sea meets the Gulf of Thailand. The black boxes on planes are equipped with electronic beacons that emit ultrasonic signals detectable underwater and can, in the right conditions, be detected from hundreds of miles away. But if trapped deep inside wreckage or an underwater trench, the effectiveness can be hindered. Australia&apos;s Department of Foreign Affairs has said it &quot;fears the worst&quot; and has contacted the family members of the Australians on board. By 10.30am, four hours after the plane was due to arrive, most people waiting for it at Beijing International airport had left. The arrivals board still listed the flight.

By late afternoon, many relatives had been waiting for hours in a hotel ballroom guarded by police. Those contacted by Chinese media said they had not been given any updates. ABC News reported that some relatives screamed in frustration that they had not been able to speak to an airline official. One sobbing woman, who had gone to meet her brother, told ABC that airline officials initially told her the flight had not taken off when she asked about its non-arrival. Several of the Chinese passengers are thought to have been returning from an art exhibition in Kuala Lumpur. In Kuala Lumpur, more family members gathered at the airport.

The canopy of cloudless blue materialised just in time, because in St\u00a0Peter&apos;s Square around 10,000 engaged couples, from 40 countries, were gathering to receive papal blessings. As with any event that involves Pope Francis, the level of interest outstripped all expectations. This, after all, is a pope enjoying his own extended honeymoon period. Intended for the cavernous Pope Paul VI auditorium, the first-ever festa dei fidanzati, or lovers&apos; party, had to be transferred to the biggest Catholic stage of all. There might have been a downpour, but of course there wasn&apos;t. As usual, in the first 12\u00a0months of what is turning out to be a\u00a0game-changing papacy, things worked out brilliantly. &quot;It was so great for us to be here,&quot; said Lucia Huang, who will marry her fianc\u00e9, Antony Lai, this December. The couple had travelled 6,000 miles from Taipei to be there. &quot;In Taiwan this pope is a\u00a0hero,&quot; added Lucia. &quot;We know all about his small car and the way he lives.&quot; The Pope, Jorge Bergoglio, did not disappoint. Before extolling the virtues of a love &quot;per sempre&quot; (for ever), he even gave the crowd a mildly risqu\u00e9 joke. &quot;We all know there isn&apos;t a\u00a0perfect family, neither a perfect husband nor a perfect wife. And let&apos;s not talk about the perfect mother-in-law,&quot; he said. The young crowd loved it. Within a year, Bergoglio, formerly Archbishop of Buenos Aires, now leader of the world&apos;s 1 billion-plus Roman Catholics, has transformed the plummeting reputation of the 2,000-year-old institution he leads. Veterans have been left open-mouthed. Sean-Patrick Lovett, director of English programming at Vatican Radio, came to Rome in 1977. He has seen Pope Paul VI, John Paul I, John Paul II and Benedict XVI come and go. But he has never witnessed anything like this. &quot;In recent times it&apos;s felt like I&apos;ve had to defend my faith, to defend the fact that I am a Catholic,&quot; says Lovett. &quot;Now I&apos;ve never been so proud to be a Catholic working in the Vatican. At the moment I am just enjoying the man. I&apos;m drawing inspiration from him.&quot; It&apos;s not only Catholics who are impressed. Way beyond the ranks of the faithful, the first Latin American pontiff has wowed the world. Analyses, encomiums and awards have tumbled forth at a dizzying pace. The liberal American media cannot get enough of him. Time magazine pronounced Francis man of the year. Gawker, the American gossip site, took time out to salute the man it called &quot;our cool new pope&quot;. In January Rolling Stone magazine, home to profiles of the likes of Britney Spears and Johnny Depp, ran a 10,000-word piece. Even graffiti artists have done their bit: one wall close to St Peter&apos;s basilica carries a\u00a0portrait of the 77-year-old Argentine as Superman in a cassock. What on earth is going on? A year ago the Catholic church was arguably at its lowest ebb since the Reformation. The shy, intellectual and conservative Benedict XVI had just astonished the world by retiring in exhaustion, the first pope to retire since Gregory XII in 1415. There was outrage at ongoing sex abuse scandals and associated cover-ups \u2013 Cardinal Keith O&apos;Brien had just resigned his position after an Observer expos\u00e9 of his sexual misconduct. Benedict&apos;s butler, Paolo Gabriele, had leaked private documents from Benedict&apos;s personal desk in an attempt to expose corruption within the Roman Curia. The Vatican bank was under investigation over money laundering. Amid the chaos, pews in Europe and the United States were emptying as parishioners, appalled at revelations of paedophile priests, joined those alienated by an aloof church&apos;s obsession with issues of sexual morality. Even in Latin America, Bergoglio&apos;s backyard and a modern bastion of Catholicism, the pentecostal and evangelical churches were on the rise. A revolution was required. According to Catholic tradition, the conversion of St Francis of Assisi took place when Christ called out to him from a crucifix in the crumbling medieval church of San Damiano: &quot;Francis, rebuild my house, which is falling into ruins.&quot; Given the dire circumstances 800 years later, it is easy to see why returning to the legacy of one of the church&apos;s best-loved saints appealed to Bergoglio last March. The choice of name, a papal first, was greeted with cheers from the 115 cardinals who had just elected him. But did they \u2013 did anyone \u2013 expect what has followed? Elected at a time of crisis, Pope Francis has emulated his namesake by choosing poverty, humility and solidarity with the poor as the route map to the church&apos;s salvation. In the Sistine Chapel a year ago, he called on the church to &quot;come out of herself and to go to the peripheries&quot; of life to meet the marginalised and the excluded. Days later he told assembled journalists that he wants a &quot;poor church for the poor&quot;. Many religious figures have said the same through the ages. But the first non-European pope for more than a millennium appears to mean it. The question is: can he deliver? And what would that church look like? A papal critique of capitalism is nothing new. Back in 1891, as Marxists plotted revolution across the continent of Europe, Leo XIII condemned &quot;the misery and wretchedness pressing so unjustly on the majority of the working class&quot;. Even Pope Benedict XVI, maligned by liberals as a slightly sinister conservative with a taste for expensive shoes, used his final New Year address to point to &quot;hotbeds of tension and conflict caused by growing instances of inequality between rich and poor&quot;. But Benedict&apos;s case was not helped by his affection for the many trappings and privileges of papal power. One priest based in Rome recalls a speech on social justice delivered in Benedict&apos;s native Germany. &quot;It was a great speech. And then he left with an entourage of 20 limousines and two helicopters. He just didn&apos;t see any contradiction.&quot;     Julian Coman: 'Way beyond the ranks of the faithful, the first Latin American pontiff has wowed the world'.

With relish, he has ridden roughshod over the conventions of the papacy. Rather than follow his predecessors and occupy the Apostolic Palace (&quot;You could fit 300 people in here!&quot; he apparently told aides), he chose to stay on at the modest Casa Santa Marta guesthouse, his home during the conclave. He has rejected the traditional red mozzetta lined with ermine, and the red shoes to which Benedict was so attached, in favour of black boots and a plain white cassock. Instead of the usual pectoral cross of gold, he wears an inexpensive metallic-looking crucifix which he brought from Buenos Aires (the look is apparently catching on in the Vatican). He travels around Rome in a blue Ford Focus. From the moral high ground of this conspicuous lack of consumption, Francis has given the denizens of the world&apos;s boardrooms, banks and offshore tax havens a rare old dressing down. In his tub-thumping first encyclical, Evangelii Gaudium (The Joy of the Gospel), Francis threw down the gauntlet to the wealthy in a way no pope has ever done before. &quot;While the earnings of a minority are growing exponentially,&quot; reads one passage, &quot;so too is the gap separating the majority from the prosperity enjoyed by those happy few.&quot; After taking a\u00a0swipe at &quot;self-serving&quot; tax evaders, Francis issues a startlingly direct message to the rich and powerful: &quot;The pope loves everyone, rich and poor alike, but he is obliged in the name of Christ to remind all that the rich must help, respect and promote the poor.&quot; In January the same message was delivered in a papal letter read to the global business elite at Davos. Father Michael Czerny, who works at the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, was there. &quot;Francis was saying to them: &apos;You&apos;ve done well; you&apos;ve been given intelligence, creativity, capacity for innovation. You&apos;ve earned well and now you must put these gifts to work. Now you must address the problem of those who are systematically excluded.&apos; In the room there was warm applause. So it&apos;s up to them. We&apos;ll see.&quot; Among Catholics who have long campaigned for social justice but found that cause submerged beneath controversies over gay marriage and abortion, there is a sense of relief and release. &quot;It feels like there is a new sense of energy,&quot; said Sarah Teather, the Liberal Democrat MP. &quot;Francis has helped create a following wind for people working behind the scenes to alleviate poverty and social exclusion. You can feel it when church leaders such as Cardinal Nichols speak. They have spoken like that before, but now there is a real connection and authority there.&quot; Non-Catholics are also taking note. In his Hugo Young lecture last month, Labour leader Ed Miliband argued that dealing with inequality had become a political priority in a way not seen for generations, adding: &quot;We have a pope who says the same.&quot; In some of the wealthier outposts of the church, the response has been a\u00a0good deal frostier. From Boston, the billionaire founder of Home Depot, Kenneth Langone, told the Archbishop of New York, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, that the pope&apos;s strictures were endangering philanthropic efforts to restore St Patrick&apos;s Cathedral at a cost of $180m. A devout Catholic, Langone pointed out that Americans were among the biggest charitable donors in the world and expressed the hope that the pope would in future &quot;celebrate a positive point of view rather than a negative one&quot;. The conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh cut to the chase, describing Evangelii Gaudium as &quot;pure Marxism&quot;. Rather stylishly, Francis refuted the charge, but added: &quot;In my life I have known many Marxists who are good people, so I don&apos;t feel offended.&quot; Criticism closer to home might worry him more. Faced with a pope who is as unorthodox as he is popular, Vatican traditionalists are worried. Norman Tanner, professor of church history at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, is one of the world&apos;s leading authorities on the history of the Catholic church. He is also a fan. There is no doubting, he says, the significance and the dramatic impact of Pope Francis&apos;s first 12 months. &quot;It&apos;s been a remarkable success,&quot; he says. &quot;He&apos;s opened a lot of windows. Before the Second Vatican Council [which opened in 1962], John XXIII said: &apos;Open the window and let in some fresh air.&apos; And this is very similar.&quot; But he adds a coda: &quot;Some are uneasy, though. They think: &apos;Is he opening the floodgates?&apos;&quot; Last July, Father Bernd Hagenkord, a\u00a0colleague of Lovett&apos;s at Vatican Radio, was expecting a quiet news day. The pope was flying back from World Catholic Youth Day in Rio. Nothing to report then. But when Hagenkord tuned into a live feed, he discovered that an unplanned and unprecedented press conference was taking place at the back of the papal plane. &quot;I was shocked. It was so dangerous. As he answered questions I was thinking: &apos;OK, you answered that one well. Now please stop!&apos;&quot; Francis carried on for 80 minutes. When one journalist, scarcely believing her luck, took the opportunity to ask about the existence of a &quot;gay lobby&quot; inside the Vatican, the pope chose to make a broader point. &quot;If someone is gay, and they seek the Lord, and they are in good faith, who am I to judge?&quot; Instantly, the apparently off-the-cuff comment made headlines around the world. To give some context, Benedict had described homosexuality as an &quot;intrinsic disorder&quot;. As commentators were quick to point out, the words indicated no doctrinal shift whatsoever. Francis was not about to sign off on gay marriage. As Archbishop of Buenos Aires, he opposed President Cristina Kirchner&apos;s legalisation of same-sex relationships. But to paraphrase 1970s comedian Frank Carson, it was the way he said it. Here was a pope questioning his own right to leap to judgement. In the words of Tanner: &quot;It was a statement about the church&apos;s authority.&quot; There have been many other forays beyond the church&apos;s comfort zone, or to &quot;the periphery&quot;, as Francis would put it. On Maundy Thursday, days after his election, Francis went to the Casal de Marmo, a young offender institution. There he washed the feet of 12 inmates aged between 14 and 21. One of them was a girl from Serbia, who thus became the first Muslim and the first woman ever to have their feet washed by a pope. Such symbolic expressions of openness, inclusion and humility have been accompanied by a series of far-reaching moves to open up the decision-making process of the church. Habitually referring to himself as &quot;Bishop of Rome&quot; rather than Pope, Francis has moved to empower bishops&apos; conferences and free them from the authoritarian grip which Rome has exerted for decades. In October an extraordinary Synod of Bishops will meet to discuss family life. It is widely expected that the exclusion of divorcees from the sacraments \u2013 one of the most resented aspects of church doctrine among the faithful \u2013 will be looked at and revised. The creation of a so-called G8 of Cardinals to advise the pope on reform has been hailed by the Italian church historian Alberto Melloni as the &quot;most important step in the history of the church for the past 10 centuries&quot;.     Man of the people: Pope Francis in St Peter\u2019s last summer. Photograph: Reuters    For the first time in 50 years, one of the most conservative institutions in the world may be opening itself up to different voices and to change, glacial though that process might seem to the outside world. In an interview with Antonio Spadaro, the Italian Jesuit and editor of La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica, Francis stated, as baldly as any pope could do, that the church, like any human institution, must be open to changing its mind. &quot;Human self-understanding changes with time,&quot; he told Spadaro. &quot;Let us think of when slavery was accepted, or the death penalty was allowed without any problem.&quot; He added that &quot;other sciences and their development help the church in its growth in understanding&quot;. Little wonder then that Francis is inspiring optimism not seen since the heady days of Second Vatican Council. In the words of Tanner, the new pope is showing a willingness &quot;to listen to what the world of the time (including the non-Catholic and non-Christian world) is saying and doing&quot;. There is listening, though, and then there is acting. In Paul Vallely&apos;s masterly biography of Francis, Untying the Knots, the Argentine rabbi Abraham Skorka, who has known Bergoglio for more than two decades, tells Vallely: &quot;He&apos;s totally aware that he must in some sense be a revolutionary pope, not only for the Catholic church, but for the whole of humanity.&quot; But revolutions require moments of decisive action. Just as church traditionalists have shaken their heads at a man who seems to prefer the title Bishop of Rome, there are also liberals who doubt that progressive intentions will translate into meaningful action. Linda Woodhead, professor of the sociology of religion at Lancaster University, is a Francis-sceptic. &quot;There is huge hope riding on this pope,&quot; she says. &quot;But so far it has just been gestures. Everyone is holding their breath before the Synod in October. I think it is likely there may be movement on divorcees and the sacraments. But what about the role of women in the church? What about the church and its relation to gay people?&quot; She points to the results of a survey of German Catholics, intended to inform debate at the Synod. The German bishops&apos; report noted a huge disconnect between the laity and the church, &quot;above all when it comes to premarital cohabitation, the status of the divorced and remarried, birth control and homosexuality&quot;. In England and Wales, the church has so far not disclosed the results of its own online survey, but Woodhead&apos;s own research has found that a mere 8% of British Catholics look most to &quot;the traditions and teaching of the church&quot; for guidance. &quot;The Catholic church is still deeply out of step in the west,&quot; says Woodhead. &quot;A lot of people are hopeful that with Francis that will change. I&apos;m not too hopeful, though.&quot; She recalls that in the famous Q&amp;A on the plane back from Rio last summer, when the possibility of female priests was raised, Francis said simply: &quot;With regards to the ordination of women, the church has spoken and says no.&quot; Jon O&apos;Brien, the chief executive of Catholics for Choice, a Washington-based organisation dedicated to supporting &quot;a woman&apos;s moral and legal right to follow her conscience on sexuality and reproductive health&quot;, shares Woodhead&apos;s doubts. &quot;You would have to be seriously in denial not to recognise that Francis has brought about real change,&quot; he says. &quot;He&apos;s not so much been a breath of fresh air as someone who has gone into the Vatican with an oxygen tank strapped to his back. He&apos;s got the church out of a very difficult spot. But there&apos;s a danger that people project something on to him that&apos;s not quite there yet.&quot; An institution this ancient does not change overnight. After such an extraordinary 12\u00a0months, maybe progressive Catholics should concentrate on the bit of the glass that&apos;s half full. That, at any rate, is what the Advocate, the oldest and largest LGBT publication in the United States, appears to be doing. Back in December, like Time, it named Pope Francis person of the year. Needless to say, he was the first pontiff to win the award. In a moving explanation of its choice, the magazine explained: &quot;As pope, he has not yet said the Catholic church supports civil unions. But what Francis does say about LGBT people has already caused reflection and consternation within his church. &quot;The brevity of that statement (Who am I\u00a0to judge?) and the outsized attention it got immediately are evidence of the pope&apos;s sway. His posing a simple question with very Christian roots, when uttered in this context by this man, became a signal to Catholics and the world that the new pope is not like the old pope.&quot; No readers of the Advocate were invited to the St Valentine&apos;s Day bash in St Peter&apos;s Square last month. But what the hell. Maybe next year?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/11/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370-may-have-turned-back-say-authorities", "publicationDate": "2014-03-11T06:48:41Z", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "Malaysia", "Plane crashes", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["Taiwan and New Zealand have joined the multinational hunt."], "title": "Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 may have turned back, say authorities", "article": "The missing Malaysia Airlines plane may have tried to head for another airport, the company said on Tuesday, with the search expanding to land as it entered a fourth day.

By raising prices of homes, especially in London and the south-east, Help to Buy defeats the purpose of extending access to housing. The six-point plan proposed here would result in a more durable recovery powered by much-needed investment in infrastructure and housing. It begins with two fundamental reforms: switching to a fiscal target that takes account not just of government debt but of assets, and setting up a national land bank, learning from international experience. The ratio of government debt to national income matters: interest has to be paid on debt, and current national income is a rough proxy for the future national income that will generate the tax revenue to service the debt. But the current exclusive concern with debt is a big mistake: the government&apos;s asset position is just as important because assets help to generate the future income to service the debt or can be sold to pay down debt. For example, roads generate revenue directly, even without road pricing or toll roads, from taxes on petrol and licences, and indirectly from the economic activity they lubricate. The real rate of return in Britain on such infrastructure investment \u2013 for example, upgrading the A1 in the north-east \u2013 greatly exceeds the current cost of funding. Further, much of government-owned land is obviously saleable and not hard to value. It makes no sense to include only financial assets in government net debt and exclude potentially saleable land. The first announcement of the budget should therefore state that, in future, the government will target the growth of debt minus assets. Increasing government debt would then not be a concern if it was matched by an increase in assets such as publicly owned productive infrastructure and land. This better target would also discourage the accounting practices of the Brown era, when expensive PFI contracts were used to fund public sector investment without recognising the underlying liabilities. The second fundamental announcement in the budget, made possible by the first, should be the setting up of a national land bank. This acquires land cheaply and holds it for future release for housing and commercial development. In countries such as South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, national land banks have played major roles in urban development, supplying land for housing, generating planning gain to pay for infrastructure and in controlling real estate prices. In Britain, with sometimes hundred-fold price differences between land with and without planning permission, a government land bank could buy land without residential or commercial planning permission but with potential for future development. In future, this would be a source of land release for housing and other development, capturing planning gain for the taxpayer. Such land purchases would initially have zero impact on correctly measured net debt, but future revaluation gains would bring down net debt, while the cashflow from sales would lower future government deficits. This radical step, together with better incentives for local authorities to grant planning permissions, would transform the supply of housing in under-housed Britain. Currently, young people without wealthy and generous relatives have great difficulty getting onto the housing ladder. According to the census the fraction of owner occupiers among those aged 25 to 34 has declined from 58% in 2001 to 40% in 2011. The land bank proposal would allow house prices relative to income gradually to decline in coming decades, helping the &quot;lost generation&quot; of those born after 1979. The next four decisions would complement these two fundamentals: 1. Substantially increase infrastructure spending. 2. Restrict Help to Buy to regions outside London and the south-east but retain Help to Build everywhere to encourage house building. 3. Announce a mansion tax in which the excess of current values above \u00a33m is taxed at 1%. Britain has the lowest property tax rates for the super-rich among advanced countries. The proposed tax rate would still be lower than in many other countries such as the US. Measures 2 and 3 would take some of the heat out of housing markets in London and the south-east. 4. Take advantage of low borrowing costs in index-linked gilts to fund more than the current government deficit by issuing large amounts of index linked gilts. &quot;Overfunding&quot; of this kind was used in the 1980s. It would save the taxpayer money in the long run. It would also have the advantage of lifting current yields and so reducing the apparent deficits in defined-benefit pension schemes. This should boost company investment in the real economy. These measures for balanced and sustained growth and a more equal society need a government capable of taking the long view currently lacking in Westminster. \u2022 John Muellbauer is a professor of economics at Nuffield College and INET Oxford"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/19/budget-2014-on-the-ground-bsa-machine-tools", "publicationDate": "2014-03-19T19:43:44Z", "tags": ["Budget 2014", "Manufacturing sector", "Budget", "UK news", "Business", "Youth unemployment", "Apprenticeships", "Unemployment"], "sentences": ["He welcomed the chancellor&apos;s vision of a Britain that makes things again, though he recognises that for his business to be successful its high-end UK headquarters will continue to be supplemented with much of its work being outsourced to more low-tech partner enterprises in China and Taiwan."], "title": "Budget 2014: manufacturing 'missing a generation of apprentices'", "article": "It is a measure of returning confidence to the fortunes of BSA Machine Tools that four apprentices have been taken on over the past two years, bringing the full-time UK staff up to a total of 38. Given that in the 1960s the parent companies that became BSA Machine Tools employed about 14,000 people, this represents a very small step upwards after decades of decline. Nevertheless, staff here are inclined to be cautiously positive. Steve Brittan, managing director at the company, which makes machine tools for the aerospace, defence, oil and automotive industries \u2013 90% for export, feels there is a new confidence in the economy and is tentatively reaping the dividends of an export-led recovery. He welcomed the chancellor&apos;s vision of a Britain that makes things again, though he recognises that for his business to be successful its high-end UK headquarters will continue to be supplemented with much of its work being outsourced to more low-tech partner enterprises in China and Taiwan. The mild optimism felt by staff here echoes the wider excitement about the surge in exports from West Midlands to China and the rapid expansion of nearby Jaguar Land Rover, which is employing thousands of new workers. But the confidence is felt in isolated pockets and has not filtered through to much of the local area, the parliamentary constituency of Hodge Hill, south Birmingham, which still has the highest level of youth unemployment and the second highest overall unemployment in the country. Liam Byrne, Labour MP for the constituency, said many of the new jobs that had recently been created were part time, zero-hours contracts. While he welcomed signs of recovery in West Midlands manufacturing, he noted: &quot;The flipside of that is that this new wealth is not widely shared. It sits alongside deeply entrenched poverty.&quot; BSA Machine Tools&apos; headquarters have shrunk from the vast expanse they occupied until the 1980s, with land sold to make car parks and a large bingo hall (where managers will be celebrating the chancellor&apos;s decision to halve bingo duties to 10%), and now occupy a long narrow warehouse, where mainly elderly staff are working on three \u00a31.7m machines for export, and are preparing to start work on a \u00a31.1m order for two more machines that will be exported to Mexico for fracking. &quot;It is small beer,&quot; he says of his modest employee expansion, but he believes the government is genuine in its commitment to supporting manufacturing. In the past year he has had breakfast with David Cameron in Downing Street, to explain the needs of manufacturers exporting abroad, and has given Vince Cable lunch and a tour of the Birmingham headquarters. The announcement of a focus on cutting energy costs, given US industrial energy prices are half those in Britain, is welcome, since this is an issue Brittan cites as a significant obstacle to being competitive. &quot;I think they recognise the problems caused to manufacturing by 30 years of progressive dismantling by various governments, and that&apos;s encouraging,&quot; he said. The decades-long decline in manufacturing is evident on the shop floor, where there is a noticeable gulf in ages between the majority of staff and new recruits: 70% of employees are over 60, a high percentage are over 65 and three are over 70. One older staff member is instructing a new electrical apprentice, pointing out important aspects of a piece of equipment with his grey hospital crutch. &quot;I hope these guys will hang on in there while the apprentices come through,&quot; Brittan said. With the decline in profitability of UK manufacturing the company shrank and stopped employing new apprentices. &quot;It&apos;s a microcosm of what has happened in the UK manufacturing industry and the way it has been treated.&quot; He thinks a corner was turned about three years ago when the value of the pound dropped, making British exports more attractive globally, and when the government began making more positive commitments to the manufacturing sector. As well as the core team in Birmingham, the company contracts in a further 800 staff in China when orders require them.     BSA managing director Steve Brittan says he has a new confidence in the economy. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    Increased willingness from banks to lend to the business over the past year and the confidence given by assurances of continued low interest rates from the governor of the Bank of England have also helped the business begin to feel more secure about its future, he said. Andrew Manning, 25, one of the new apprentices who joined two years ago when the company took on a handful of big orders to make machines for the US oil industry, said: &quot;There is a missing generation in terms of apprentices \u2013 we&apos;re having to learn from the blokes who are about to retire, and they&apos;re having to hold on until we learn more.&quot; He is thrilled to be in work, particularly given the bleak employment statistics in the local area, but life remains complicated even when you are working. Because he is older than the other apprentices, he earns more than the standard \u00a35 an hour but still finds the rising cost of living in Birmingham, ever increasing rents and soaring bills a struggle and is conscious that the prospect of buying somewhere to live remains remote. A mile from the headquarters in the offices of a community centre, the Hub, which works with marginalised young people offering free access to the internet and support with looking for work, staff do not believe the people they support are feeling the effects of a recovery. The Firs and Bromford estate sits on the other side of the M6 from the Jaguar Land Rover site, but the charity has yet to help anyone find work there. &quot;We&apos;re not in Cornwall where there are no jobs, but there is a disconnect,&quot; said Paul Wright, branch director of Worth Unlimited, the charity that oversees the centre. Although the car manufacturing plant was visible from the windows of the estate&apos;s tower blocks, locals felt finding work there was only a remote possibility. This area is in the top 1% most deprived wards in England. Statistically &quot;it has all the highs that you wouldn&apos;t want to be high and all the lows that you wouldn&apos;t want low: high unemployment, high deprivation, social exclusion; low educational attainment, levels of skills&quot;, Wright said. &quot;All those statistics are there. People here do have talents and skills, the willingness to work, but there are problems with access to jobs. We see the Range Rover success story, and they are taking on people \u2013 but the jobs that tend to be available are agency, zero hour, night shifts, with no long-term security.&quot; He conceded that: &quot;If you look hard, there are some positive signs,&quot; and described the happy case of a 30-year-old man who had been unemployed for a long time and recently got a job with Land Rover, at a different site, a bit further away. His success is used to try to inspire other job-seekers who come in looking for work. &quot;It does help to be able to tell people about this person who got a job. There&apos;s nothing more inspiring than that,&quot; he said, but he conceded that this job too was a short-term placement through an agency, on a zero hour contract, night shifts, and with no long-term security. &quot;Technically he doesn&apos;t actually work for Land Rover because he is contracted through an agency. Still, in this climate he is a success story. That&apos;s why we&apos;re celebrating him.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/19/associated-press-removes-ukraine-dateline-crimea-stories", "publicationDate": "2014-03-19T20:32:06Z", "tags": ["Crimea", "Ukraine", "US press and publishing", "Russia", "Associated Press", "Media"], "sentences": ["So the AP resorts to geography whenever it fears a kerfuffle, writing \u201cBethlehem, West Bank\u201d and just \u201cJerusalem\u201d; it\u2019s just \u201cStanley, Falkland Islands\u201d and \u201cTaipei, Taiwan\u201d."], "title": "Associated Press removes Ukraine from dateline of Crimea stories", "article": "As every self-respecting copy editor knows \u2013 and as every writer and reader ought to know \u2013 style is politics, and politics inform style. As such it\u2019s no surprise that Wednesday the Associated Press\u2019 Stylebook announced would no longer head its stories from Crimea with datelines from Ukraine, eg \u201cSevastopol, Ukraine\u201d. Their reasoning: \u201cUkraine no longer controls Crimea, and AP datelines should reflect the facts on the ground.\u201d True enough, but also a little disingenuous: AP won\u2019t be writing \u201cSevastopol, Russia\u201d, even though Russia clearly controls the situation on the ground, and Tuesday said it would annex the region regardless of Ukraine and western nations\u2019 refusal to recognize the new treaty. AP, ever striving for neutrality, tries to get away with justifying the change by geography, and the new dateline \u201cSevastopol, Crimea\u201d.  Why not \u201cSevastopol, Russia\u201d if Russia formalizes its annexation of the territory? The reason is that Crimea is geographically distinct from Russia; they have no land border. Saying just the city name and \u201cCrimea\u201d in the dateline, even in the event of full annexation, would be consistent with how we handle geographically separate parts of other countries. For instance, we just say \u201cSicily\u201d and \u201cSardinia\u201d in datelines \u2014 \u201cPalermo, Sicily\u201d \u2013 even though they are part of Italy, and \u201cGuadeloupe\u201d in datelines even though that island is part of France.  The problem with this retroactive policy \u2013 besides that Crimea didn\u2019t become a peninsula overnight \u2013 is that Italy controls Sicily and France controls Guadeloupe, raising the more appropriate question of \u201cWhy now?\u201d, which is obviously answered by the fact that Crimea is contested land, and AP would rather not side with anyone involved. Again, fair enough, but why not just say so? (The New York Times has also apparently changed its style for Crimea: a story from before the referendum and annexation says \u201cUkraine\u201d, three days later a story reads \u201cCrimea\u201d. The Guardian sticks to cities alone unless the location is relatively obscure.) AP has waded into controversy before on its quest to avoid controversy. A year ago, AP banned \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d to describe a person, explaining that \u201c\u2018illegal\u2019 should describe only an action\u201d, especially as the editors decided it was important not to label people, \u201cinstead of behavior\u201d. Like the Guardian, AP promptly announced it would refer to Chelsea Manning with female pronouns and her chosen name, by the tried and true rule of \u201cUse the pronoun preferred by the individual \u2026 if that preference is not expressed, use the pronoun consistent with the way the individuals live publicly.\u201d AP even (and wisely) applies the rule to transliteration, a style point notoriously inconsistent among news organizations. By the same token, AP was right on time with its new dateline for South Sudan when it gained independence in 2011; go by what a nation\u2019s people prefer. But when it\u2019s unclear who\u2019s in charge, or what may come, or how geopolitical powers will tussle over occupation and referendums, etc, copy editors would really rather just stay out of it. So the AP resorts to geography whenever it fears a kerfuffle, writing \u201cBethlehem, West Bank\u201d and just \u201cJerusalem\u201d; it\u2019s just \u201cStanley, Falkland Islands\u201d and \u201cTaipei, Taiwan\u201d. Based on the history of those territorial disputes, it seems AP\u2019s copy editors \u2013 and those at the majority of American publications which rely on AP for guidance \u2013 are settling in for the long haul with Crimea."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/25/call-of-duty-world-championship-2014-professional-esports", "publicationDate": "2014-03-25T17:03:54Z", "tags": ["Call of Duty", "Games", "Technology", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s top League of Legends squad, the Taipei Assassins, live and train together in the shadow of the Taipei 101 skyscraper in central Taiwan."], "title": "Call of Duty World Championship 2014: how online gaming is becoming a spectator sport", "article": "The stands are empty; the pitch, still sodden and scarred from recent international rugby union clashes, is unused. Twickenham stadium in south London has hosted many major tournament finals \u2013 but none like this. Today&apos;s matches take place in a darkened hall within the stadium&apos;s towering walls, on the battlefields of multimillion-selling first-person shoot-&apos;em-up Call of Duty. Over two days, 26 teams from across Europe are competing for a place in the World Championship, held in LA at the end of the month. All the matches use the same setup: two teams of four players competing for the most &quot;kills&quot; in one of the game&apos;s fast-paced military-themed gunfights. A slouching gaggle of twentysomethings have come to watch these qualifying battles live, though most of them don&apos;t arrive until after lunchtime. If glitzy video game tournaments are the future of sport, the future hasn&apos;t quite reached south London yet. But the emerging world of professional video game competition \u2013 or eSports \u2013 is serious business. This year&apos;s Call of Duty tournament has a prize purse of $1m and the winning team takes home $400,000. Elsewhere, last year&apos;s prize pot for the fantasy-themed League of Legends championship \u2013 arguably the most popular online game in the world today \u2013 was $2m, attracting sponsorship from heavyweight brands such as Coca-Cola and American Express.     League of Legends fans watch a live game. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    Last year&apos;s League of Legends final was hosted in Los Angeles&apos; Galen Center \u2013 a location more accustomed to nationally televised basketball matches \u2013 watched live by 10,000 fans and online by more than 32 million people throughout the day, peaking at eight million simultaneous viewers. In South Korea, the sci-fi strategy game Starcraft has been referred to as the country&apos;s national sport \u2013 the top players are adored by millions of fans, and cable channels cover the game&apos;s professional tournaments. Call of Duty&apos;s European qualifiers may not have made it to the pitch yet, but they are at least inside the stadium, a symbolic stride towards a certain kind of sporting legitimacy. Call of Duty is a cultural juggernaut, produced in annual iterations that, as publisher Activision is only too eager to proclaim, routinely generate more profits than any other entertainment release in a year. Each Call of Duty title is a game of two halves: a six-hour cinematic storyline for a single player, and a vast and complicated online competitive sports game. The Call of Duty World Championship is now in its third year, and has grown out of the consumer game, where the best players gain recognition and are picked up by professional eSports teams, some of whom have dedicated scouts who search out the best players online. &quot;The time and effort these guys put in for getting to the top are crazy,&quot; says Ben Perkins, a competitor from TYT, one of the youngest teams to make it to the European leg of the championship. &quot;They don&apos;t miss shots, of course, but it&apos;s their knowledge of the maps and communication that gives them a different sort of advantage. For example, they&apos;ll see a rival player run into a building and know that, six seconds later, they&apos;ll be in a particular spot. They&apos;ll then throw a grenade through a tiny hole in the roof to cut the other player off. It&apos;s like an entirely different game to what people play at home.&quot; Literary profiles of young professional athletes often strain to find evidence of a rounded life, of interests outside of the training regime and the psychological obsession of preparation for the game. They strain because, in the majority of cases, there is no rounded life; the reality of top-level sports is that they demand participants&apos; full and dogged attention, and early and total commitment to one tightly focused area of excellence. But here in Twickenham, for the moment at least, there is little evidence of this kind of absolute immersion. On the first night of the tournament, many players stay out drinking until the early hours.     Call of Duty: Ghosts.    It&apos;s not that they are being unprofessional; it&apos;s simply that the sport lacks a natural maturity. The prize pots are too few and too weighted toward the winning team for anybody to make a professional living from the game. &quot;We tell all of the players that we work with that education comes first,&quot; says Jim Maguire, 46, manager of TCM, the team that will go on to win the European leg of the championship, and are UK favourites for the finals. &quot;I tell them: you&apos;ve got to have something to fall back on. eSports is great but it&apos;s a young person&apos;s game. You might get five years out of it. Very few go on past then so they need something to fall back on. You won&apos;t be able to retire on Call of Duty winnings.&quot;     Call of Duty championships \u2026\u00a0the prizes await.    A professional trainer would likely never say such a thing to a top-flight athlete; they would encourage the player to let go of all immediate hopes and ambitions away from the sport. There are already signs however that eSports might one day require the same level of commitment. Taiwan&apos;s top League of Legends squad, the Taipei Assassins, live and train together in the shadow of the Taipei 101 skyscraper in central Taiwan. They adhere to a strict diet and spend time every day on physical exercises to aid reflexes and general health. But, in terms of Call of Duty at least, the financial rewards aren&apos;t there to sustain quite the same level of commitment yet. &quot;Coming second or third in these tournaments doesn&apos;t hold any major financial incentive,&quot; says Maguire. Part of the issue may be that Call of Duty is less tailored to spectatorship than other competitive video games. Unlike League of Legends or Starcraft, Call of Duty is played from a first person perspective. &quot;This certainly provides an intimate view on the action,&quot; explains Joe Cecot, one of the game&apos;s designers. &quot;But it&apos;s hard to see exactly what&apos;s going on with the broader match.&quot; To aid the flow of information to spectators, and to give the game&apos;s professional commentators a tool for monitoring the flow of a game, the developer introduced a spectator mode, which outlines all enemies and friendlies in a match, even if they&apos;re obscured by a wall or building. &quot;This allows the audience to anticipate an engagement,&quot; says Cecot. &quot;They know something is about to go down, and the commentators can pick up on these moments. It&apos;s all about the flow of information.&quot;     Call Of Duty: Black Ops.    As the game&apos;s developers, Infinity Ward, wrestle with the task of designing tools to turn a niche spectator sport into something with broader appeal, the game&apos;s emergent semi-professional players are also forced to ask deeper questions about what these competitions mean in the fabric of their lives. Mark Bryceland, 19, is one quarter of TCM and the only Scottish player competing in this year&apos;s world championship. &quot;I have no idea what my ambition beyond this is,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s just sort of for fun at the moment. It&apos;s a hobby that&apos;s moving to the next level; something I can make a little money from. At the core of it I suppose I just want to be known as the best at something.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/25/htc-one-best-selling-phone-will-m8-match", "publicationDate": "2014-03-25T18:32:45Z", "tags": ["HTC", "Technology", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Internet", "Android", "Samsung", "iPhone 5", "iPhone 5S", "Apple"], "sentences": ["Figures are in millions of New Taiwan dollars (1 TWD is about 0.035 USD).", "It has begun 2014 with monthly revenues that are the smallest since 2007 (Taiwanese stock market-listed companies are obliged to file monthly revenue, though not profit, data)."], "title": "HTC One was its best-selling phone - but will the M8 rise to similar heights?", "article": "HTC&apos;s chairwoman Cher Wang announced on Tuesday that the HTC One released in 2013 &quot;was HTC&apos;s best-selling phone ever&quot;. The occasion was the release of its successor, the HTC One M8. To some this may seem surprising, given that HTC recorded its first annual net loss in 2013 of US$75m on revenues down 30% to US$6.96bn. The number of smartphones that it shipped fell by 29%, according to the research company IDC, even as the smartphone market grew 39%. Yet Wang&apos;s statement is true, IDC confirms: the HTC One shipped 6.4m units from its launch in April 2013, more than any before it. But Francisco Jeronimo, IDC&apos;s European smartphone analyst, contrasted that with other top-end smartphones, such as Apple&apos;s iPhone 5 - which shipped 62.9m units in 2013 - and iPhone 5S, released in September (39.5m), as well as Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S4, which went on sale in late April 2013 (43.3m). In all, HTC shipped a total of just 22.6m units of all its phones in the whole of 2013, says IDC &quot;The HTC One 2014 has a lot to catch up in 2014,&quot; commented Jeronimo. Overall, the smartphone market in 2013 grew to around a billion units - including a substantial market in China, where HTC has struggled to eke out a mid-market position.     HTC monthly revenue, by year, since 2008. Figures are in millions of New Taiwan dollars (1 TWD is about 0.035 USD). Photograph: /Guardian    For HTC, the past two years have been painful. Its revenues have plummeted. It has begun 2014 with monthly revenues that are the smallest since 2007 (Taiwanese stock market-listed companies are obliged to file monthly revenue, though not profit, data).  The question now is whether the HTC One M8 can help the company to regain the high ground that it used to share with Apple and Samsung. Ben Wood of the analysts CCS Insight commented: &quot;the M8 must capitalise on the distinctive design and premium materials used on the device, especially in comparison with those of its rivals. A major goal will be to capture consumers upgrading from Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S III.&quot; Those buyers would have bought their phone in spring 2012 - and will now be coming to the end of two-year contracts.  While HTC is pleased to have got agreements from 230 carriers to sell the phone at once, its executives were hugely displeased with the leaks that came ahead of the launch - even though it&apos;s suspected that some of the leaks were the result of sending the phone to carriers and having it available in so many outlets. Speaking before the launch, Peter Frolund, head of HTC&apos;s UK operations, told the Guardian: &quot;We don&apos;t like leaks, we want to entertain and surprise. We appreciate interest, but we want to avoid the leaks, but we&apos;re in an industry where the focus is on devices and the attention is gigantic. We investigate all leaks.&quot; Leaks and broken NDAs [non-disclosure agreements] have concrete financial harm, said Jeff Gordon, HTC&apos;s senior global online communications manager, as the company pursued Roshan Jamkatel, a teenage boy who uploaded a 12-minute video showing off the specifications of the M8 to YouTube at the beginning of March. HTC was also insistent at the launch that the revelations and continued series of leaks from multiple sources were not the same as using the phone. Phil Blair, head of HTC&apos;s European and Middle East operations, told the audience at the launch: &quot;You might say you&apos;ve seen our new superphone, but that&apos;s like saying you&apos;ve seen your favourite band because you&apos;ve seen them in a YouTube clip.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/25/taiwans-protesters-democracy-china-taiwan-strait", "publicationDate": "2014-03-25T22:00:01Z", "tags": ["Taiwan", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Global economy"], "sentences": ["In an east Asian version of the Occupy movement, over the past week about 20,000 students and workers have taken over Taiwan&apos;s parliament building and protested outside.", "The deal will give China&apos;s large media and publishing companies far greater access to Taiwan.", "Given Taiwan&apos;s history \u2013 it split from China in 1949 after the KMT retreated to Taiwan \u2013 the fears are that there will be many more China Times-type takeovers.", "And, further, that economic dominance will lead to political dominance, under which the gains made by Taiwan&apos;s people over the past two decades \u2013 such as a multi-party parliamentary democracy and press freedom \u2013 will be lost.", "A statement by the protesters, who call themselves the Sunflower Movement, said: &quot;Regardless of the political division between pro-unification with China and those pro-independence for Taiwan, this trade agreement will allow large capital to devour the majority of small peasants, labourers and small businesses, not to mention the difficulties the future generation of Taiwan will face.&quot; Academics at 25 universities have also come out to support the students.", "There have been street lectures, debating China&apos;s state capitalism and &quot;what does free trade do to free speech?&quot; During the cold war, Taiwan was economically and politically bonded to the west, whereas in the past two decades the island&apos;s economy has been caught between competing capitalist powers, China being the most powerful in the region.", "Taiwan&apos;s trade unions believe that free trade agreements are bad for workers.", "The Taoyuan Federation of Trade Unions says that 16 years ago, when the government opened the island to free trade, it left &quot;waves of Taiwan&apos;s workers laid off without redundancy and pension\u2026 This will happen again with the trade agreement today&quot;.", "Wages in Taiwan, particular in service industries (in which 60% of Taiwan&apos;s working people are employed), have been on the decrease, by 6% in the past decade.", "Under the trade agreement, China&apos;s larger service businesses can enter and compete with the smaller service businesses in Taiwan, which will likely lead to the lowering of wages and worsening of conditions.", "Taiwan&apos;s unions are supporting the Sunflower Movement, supplying water and food provisions to the occupiers.", "Neither students nor workers want to leave their future in the hands of the ruling elites, or see their jobs controlled by conglomerates on both sides of the Taiwan Strait."], "title": "Taiwan's protesters are fighting for the very democracy of the island | Hsiao-Hung Pai", "article": "In an east Asian version of the Occupy movement, over the past week about 20,000 students and workers have taken over Taiwan&apos;s parliament building and protested outside.

When a group of students stormed the government headquarters on Sunday, over 100 people were injured in a crackdown by the police. The deal will give China&apos;s large media and publishing companies far greater access to Taiwan. The island&apos;s China Times Group, for instance, was bought in 2008 by the pro-China Want Want Holdings, one of the largest food manufacturing conglomerates in Asia. Given Taiwan&apos;s history \u2013 it split from China in 1949 after the KMT retreated to Taiwan \u2013 the fears are that there will be many more China Times-type takeovers.

Wages in Taiwan, particular in service industries (in which 60% of Taiwan&apos;s working people are employed), have been on the decrease, by 6% in the past decade.

The lump of ice and rock circles the sun at a greater distance than any known object, and never gets closer than 12bn kilometres \u2013 80 times the distance from Earth to the sun. If its size is confirmed it could qualify as a dwarf planet in the same category as Pluto. Researchers said the discovery proves the existence of the inner Oort cloud, a region of icy bodies that lies far beyond the orbit of Neptune \u2013 which at 4.5bn kilometres from the sun is the most remote planet in the solar system. Until a proper name is decided upon, the body is known only as 2012 VP113. According to the science journal Nature, the team that discovered it call it VP for short, or &quot;Biden&quot;, after US vice president Joe Biden.   Its pink tinge comes from radiation damage that alters the make-up of frozen water, methane and carbon dioxide on the surface. Though exciting in its own right, the discovery raises a more tantalising prospect for many astronomers: that a &quot;Super Earth&quot; up to 10 times the mass of our planet orbits the sun at such a great distance that it has never been seen.   113\" width=\"460\" height=\"131\" class=\"gu-image\" />  Three images of the newly discovered dwarf planet 2012 VP113 taken about two hours apart on 5 November 2012. Photograph: Scott S Sheppard/Carnegie Institution for Science    Astronomers found 2012 VP113 by taking snapshots of the night sky an hour or so apart with an instrument called the Dark Energy Camera on the US National Optical Astronomy Observatory telescope in Chile. When they turned the images into a time-lapse movie of the sky, they could see the new body moving against the background of stationary stars. &quot;This object has the most distant orbit known,&quot; Scott Sheppard at the Carnegie Institution of Washington told the Guardian. &quot;It extends the known boundary of the observable solar system.&quot; The object&apos;s orbit brings it as close as 12bn kilometres from the sun, and swings out as far as 67bn kilometres. There are comets that come from even farther out, but they pass much closer to our home planet. The solar system has three distinct regions. Closest to the sun are the rocky planets, such as Venus, Earth and Mars. Farther out are the gas giants, such as Saturn and Jupiter. More distant still, beyond the orbit of Neptune, is a band of icy objects called the Kuiper belt. In 2003, astronomers found an object beyond the Kuiper belt, which they called Sedna. For more than a decade, the object was a loner, an anomaly in the solar system. But the new body, 2012 VP113, lurks in the same no-man&apos;s land of space, leading astronomers to believe there could be thousands of similar bodies waiting to be discovered there. &quot;People wondered if Sedna was unique, and 10 years on, we have at last found another object that shows it is not. There is probably a large population of objects out there,&quot; Sheppard said.   113\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" />  The dwarf planet (coloured dots). Three images, each taken about two hours apart, were combined into one. The first was artificially colored red, second green and third blue. The background stars and galaxies did not move and so their red, green and blue images combine to show up as white sources. Photograph: Scott S Sheppard/Carnegie Institution for Science    The region of space where Sedna and 2012 VP113 were found is called the inner Oort cloud. Astronomers are unsure how this remote cloud of objects formed, but there are three competing theories. One is that a rogue planet was flung out of the early solar system and dragged the Oort cloud material with it. Another is that the material was pulled out of the inner solar system by a passing star. The third option has the same job done by planets orbiting stars born in the same cluster as the sun. &quot;What is exciting about this work is that we know the inner Oort cloud is there. This is the second object we know of, and it&apos;s a smoking gun,&quot; said Meg Schwamb, a planetary scientist at the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Academica Sinica in Taiwan. By studying the objects, astronomers hope to confirm how the inner Oort cloud formed. Sheppard found the new object, reported in Nature, with fellow astronomer, Chad Trujillo, who works at the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii. Trujillo was a co-discoverer of Sedna in 2003. The latest work has already thrown up an intriguing possibility. The angle of the body&apos;s orbit and that of Sedna&apos;s are strikingly similar, an effect most likely caused by the gravitational tug of another, unseen body. One possibility is a &quot;Super Earth&quot; that traces so large an orbit around the sun that it has never been seen. &quot;If you took a Super Earth and put it a few hundred astronomical units out, the gravity could shepherd Sedna and this new object into the orbits they have,&quot; said Sheppard. An astronomical unit (AU) is around 150m kilometres, or the mean distance from Earth to the sun. Earlier this month, Nasa&apos;s Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (Wise) reported the results from its search for &quot;Planet X&quot;, a hypothesised planet far out in the solar system. It found no evidence for a new planet larger than Saturn within 10,000 AU of the sun. But Saturn is 95 times more massive than Earth, so a smaller Super Earth could go undetected in that region."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/palau-sharks-ban-commercial-fishing-tuna-industry", "publicationDate": "2014-03-26T18:15:00Z", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Biodiversity", "Business", "Environment", "Corporate social responsibility", "Fishing"], "sentences": ["Commercial fishing, largely by boats from Japan and Taiwan, represents $5m annually \u2013 or 3.3% of GDP \u2013 to Palau."], "title": "Palau's plans to ban commercial fishing could set precedent for tuna industry", "article": "The Pacific island-nation of Palau is close to kicking all commercial fishing vessels out of its tropical waters. The move will single-handedly section off more than 230,000 sq miles of ocean, an area slightly smaller than France, to create one of the world&apos;s largest marine reserves. The sanctuary, which Palauan President Thomas Remengesau Jr announced at the United Nations last month, would also sit inside the world&apos;s last healthy stand of lucrative, tasty tuna.  Giving fishing vessels the boot is bold for any nation, but perhaps more so for Palau, a smattering of 300 islands east of the Philippines. Tuna, America&apos;s favorite finned fish, is a regional boon worth an estimated $5.5bn. Commercial fishing, largely by boats from Japan and Taiwan, represents $5m annually \u2013 or 3.3% of GDP \u2013 to Palau. But still, the island state says it will allow existing fishing licenses to expire. The move, hailed by ocean conservationists, sets a worrying precedent for the tuna industry. While the commercial catch inside Palau is minimal, captains covet the freedom to chase warm-blooded, migratory tuna across jurisdictions. If Palau goes through with the plan, it will mark the first time a nation has completely banned fishing vessels from its entire Exclusive Economic Zone. &quot;Our concern is not so much a practical one as it is a concern with the precedent of closing areas with no scientific basis for it,&quot; says Brian Hallman, executive director of the American Tunaboat Association.  &quot;The migratory range of tunas is vast, covering the waters of many countries and the high seas. So the only way to conserve stocks is by international treaty arrangements and this is already being done.&quot; Palau&apos;s decision to act alone could be seen as a warning to the fishing industry to take the sustainability concerns of smaller, fish-rich nations more seriously and to work with these countries on more nimble and responsive solutions. A domino effect? Palau currently works with seven of its island neighbors to co-operatively manage a large swath of ocean. Jointly, these eight nations set fishing quotas and sustainability standards to manage nearly a third of the world&apos;s tuna stock. Balancing both conservation and business, the alliance became the first group of countries certified by the Marine Stewardship Council for managing its tuna grounds sustainably.  But this arrangement hinges on allowing more-sustainable fishing inside member waters. If Palau bans commercial fishing, it&apos;s unclear how this will impact the broader regional effort.  &quot;There&apos;s nothing in these agreements that require we allow fishing in our waters,&quot; Remengesau says in a telephone interview. &quot;It&apos;s all about the regional area. Our conservation efforts would ensure that the stocks are healthy and that they gain in economic value as they move out of our territorial waters into other waters.&quot; When it comes down to it though, banning commercial boats simply appears to be in Palau&apos;s interests.  Even though the bulk of commercial fishing in the region focuses on tuna, sharks are frequently hauled in as bycatch. Yanking sharks out of the sea directly hits Palau&apos;s biggest moneymaker: the $85m dive tourism industry.      More valuable alive than dead. Photograph: Brian J Skerry/Getty Images/National Geographic    &quot;We feel that a live tuna or shark is worth a thousand times more than a dead fish,&quot; Remengesau says.  A visionary move? A 2010 Australian study backs him up. The researchers calculated that shark divers bring Palau $18m per year, with each swimming shark worth $1.9m in diving and tourism. Through this lens, sharks contribute 8% of Palau&apos;s GDP.  Matt Rand, director of the global oceans legacy at Pew Charitable Trust, says taking full stock of the value of living marine resources makes both economic and conservation sense.  &quot;I think it&apos;s visionary,&quot; he says. &quot;[Remengesau] looked at the global picture for the oceans and decided to preserve the marine ecosystem, not only for the seas, but for his economy and for his people. I think there&apos;s tremendous conservation value in what Palau is trying to do.&quot; But there&apos;s still a long way to go. While several studies show marine protected areas enhance fisheries and biodiversity, a study published in the scientific journal, Nature, last month shows that not all are created equal. Scientists examined 87 such areas and found that a marine preserve needs at least three of five criteria to be successful. The study found that many failed to do so, leaving 59% &quot;not ecologically distinguishable from fished sites&quot;. Palau&apos;s sanctuary would be large and legally protected \u2013 two key attributes for success \u2013 but its viability will likely hinge on the nation&apos;s ability to stop pirate fishing, which is no easy feat. Palau currently battles hundreds of pirate fishing vessels with a single patrol boat. Pressure from the outside Then there&apos;s the risk of international financial pressure.  Palau could stand to lose a lot more than the $5m in direct fishing revenue. The nation is slated to receive $215m from the US in economic assistance and grants through 2024. But Michael Tosatto, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says that if Palau bans American boats it may risk losing some of those funds. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t say everything is about tuna,&quot; he says, &quot;but it&apos;s a large part. If it weren&apos;t for the tuna treaty, there likely wouldn&apos;t be a multilateral assistance agreement. I&apos;m not with the State Department, so I can&apos;t say for sure, but if they fully extract themselves, they could lose access.&quot; Will Palau remain committed to this plan even if it means losing US aid? &quot;We&apos;re very committed to it,&quot; Remengesau says. &quot;But also, I don&apos;t believe the US would retaliate against a small island nation that is its best ally in the United Nations simply because they want to force something down our throats as far as our conservation efforts.&quot;  This story was produced by the Food and Environment Reporting Network, an independent non-profit news organization focusing on food, agriculture and environmental health "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/26/barack-obama-putin-withering-civics-lesson-crimea", "publicationDate": "2014-03-26T21:31:12Z", "tags": ["Russia", "Barack Obama", "Europe", "World news", "Ukraine", "Crimea", "Vladimir Putin"], "sentences": ["It has steadfastly refused to condemn the Russians, in case it needs to invade Taiwan."], "title": "Barack Obama delivers withering civics lesson to Putin over Crimea", "article": "Facing the biggest punch-up with Russia since the end of the cold war, Barack Obama did what he does best: he came out talking. The former Harvard professor gave class dunce Vladimir Putin a withering civics lesson over his badly thought-through invasion of Crimea. History was on the side of those who believed in individual freedom, universal rights and democracy, he said. The &quot;might is right&quot; alternative \u2013 the playground resort to &quot;brute force&quot; recalling Europe&apos;s past &quot;descent into barbarism&quot; \u2013 was no alternative at all. In fact, it was a generation or more out of date, as every half-sensible student of the 20th century must surely realise. &quot;We must meet the challenge to our ideals and our international order with strength and conviction,&quot; Obama insisted in scholarly fashion. There could be &quot;no going back&quot;. Whether he meant no going back to Crimea, which is certainly true for Kiev&apos;s beleaguered rulers, or to the era of &quot;extreme nationalism&quot; from which he said Europe had escaped in 1945 was unclear. An eve-of-battle speech it was not. As a stirring call to arms, it lacked fire. Some among his invited Euro-elite audience in the glittering Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels took to taking selfies or sending Twitter messages. If they had been hoping for a second Duchess of Richmond&apos;s ball, held on the night before Waterloo, they were disappointed. In practical terms, Obama added little or nothing to the mild punishments already handed out to Moscow. Only if Putin transgressed again, in eastern Ukraine or the territories of neighbouring Nato members, would more sanctions be imposed. Despite his avowal that Crimea&apos;s annexation was illegal and unrecognised, that seemed to put the cap on any thought the US might seek to force its reversal. It also left non-Nato border states such as Georgia, Moldova and Finland to wonder what his response might be if they are next in the firing line. Eschewing sticks and stones, Obama stuck to wounding words. The Soviet Union lost the cold war for a reason, he said: it had tried to repress freedom, rather than celebrate it. A new cold war was not dawning, for the simple reason that Russia was no longer powerful enough to match the US and its allies ideologically or geopolitically. Washington did not seek to humiliate the Russian people \u2013 only to bring them round to its way of thinking, which would inevitably happen one day. Obama, who once likened Putin to a bored schoolboy behaving disruptively at the back of the class, was crushing in his disdain and masterly in his reproach. Without once mentioning the Russian president by name, he patiently explained that Putin&apos;s actions threatened the &quot;architecture of peace&quot; painstakingly erected after the second world war. The US did not have to come to Ukraine&apos;s rescue. Its own borders and security were not directly threatened. It was doing so because Russia&apos;s behaviour could not be ignored, since that would set an anarchic precedent that might be emulated in Africa or Asia. Perhaps he was thinking of China. It has steadfastly refused to condemn the Russians, in case it needs to invade Taiwan. The US only wanted good relations with Russia. Once he had truly understood the error of his ways, Putin might be allowed back into class. Obama was soothing, conciliatory and ineffably smug. His grasp of the moral high ground was so very high, his head was in danger of disappearing into clouds of hot air. &quot;We do not regard ourselves as the sole arbiters of what is right in the world,&quot; he said. &quot;We are not perfect.&quot; Truly."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/27/iran-iraq-global-rise-capital-punishment", "publicationDate": "2014-03-27T00:02:00Z", "tags": ["Capital punishment", "World news", "Iran", "Middle East and North Africa", "Iraq"], "sentences": ["Somalia executed at least 34, Sudan 21, Yemen 13, Japan eight, Vietnam seven and Taiwan six."], "title": "Iran and Iraq account for global rise in capital punishment", "article": "Iran and Iraq are responsible for a sharp rise in capital punishment, accounting for more than two-thirds of the world&apos;s executions last year. Although significantly fewer countries use the death penalty today than two decades ago, &quot;killing sprees&quot; in Iran and Iraq helped cause a 15% increase in the number of executions globally, according to Amnesty International&apos;s annual survey on death sentences and capital punishment. At least 778 executions were known to have been carried out globally in 2013, 538 of them in Iran and Iraq alone, showed the 62-page report published on Thursday. It was up from 682 executions in 2012. &quot;The killing sprees we saw in countries like Iran and Iraq were shameful,&quot; said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International&apos;s secretary general. &quot;Only a small number of countries carried out the vast majority of these senseless state-sponsored killings. &quot;The long-term trend is clear \u2013 the death penalty is becoming a thing of the past. We urge all governments who still kill in the name of justice to impose a moratorium on the death penalty immediately, with a view to abolishing it.&quot; China is believed to have executed several thousand people \u2013 more than the rest of the world together \u2013 but exact figures are unavailable as Beijing authorities classify execution statistics as a state secret. Iran officially acknowledged the execution of at least 369 people (55 more than in 2012) but activists say many hundreds more were put to death in secret, taking the actual number of executions in the Islamic republic close to 700. Earlier this month, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, criticised Iran&apos;s president, Hassan Rouhani, for his failure to reduce the country&apos;s rate of executions. The UN chief said Rouhani&apos;s new administration had not changed Tehran&apos;s approach to the death penalty. Ahmed Shaheed, the UN special rapporteur for human rights in Iran, said that at least 176 people had been put to death since the beginning of 2014. Those executed in Iran last year include Habibollah Golparipour, a Kurdish political prisoner convicted of the crime of moharebeh (waging war against God). Amnesty said he was given a death sentence in a trial that lasted only five minutes and was executed without prior notice to his family. It was not clear if he had access to a lawyer. Iraq executed at least 169 people, an increase of almost a third from the previous year. Amnesty said many were executed on vague charges related to anti-terrorism laws. Saudi Arabia acknowledged executing at least 79 people, of whom three were juvenile offenders, in defiance of international law. The US put to death 39. Somalia executed at least 34, Sudan 21, Yemen 13, Japan eight, Vietnam seven and Taiwan six. Indonesia and Kuwait each executed five and South Sudan and Nigeria each four. Gaza executed at least three. Malaysia and Afghanistan each executed two people and India one. Exact figures were unobtainable in a number of countries including North Korea and also in Syria where civil war prevents documenting such figures. Amnesty said it could not confirm how many people were executed in Egypt, which stunned the world by sentencing more than 500 people to death this week. In Africa, Benin, Ghana and Sierra Leone took some promising steps towards ending the death penalty, but Somalia saw an alarming rise in its use of capital punishment, executing at least 34 people, up from six in 2012. In the Americas, the US is the only country that still uses capital punishment. More than third of its executions were carried out in the state of Texas. Despite all this, Amnesty says the long-term trend continues to be one of a worldwide decline in the use of capital punishment. In 2013, 22 countries carried out executions (one more than the 21 countries in 2012), which is almost one in 10 countries in the world. There were improvements, too. Belarus, which has not abolished the death penalty, did not implement any death sentences, making Europe and central Asia an execution-free zone last year. Gambia, the UAE and Pakistan, which had previously put people to death, also refrained from carrying out executions. Saudi Arabia practiced beheading as a method of execution, while the US used electrocution. Hanging was used in a wide-range of countries such as Afghanistan, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia and India. Iran was among the countries that carried out public executions, drawing much international condemnation. Lethal injection (in China and the US) and firing squad (in Somalia and Yemen) were among other methods. A number of non-lethal crimes were punishable by death across the world, including drug offences, adultery, sodomy, blasphemy and pornography. North Korea is believed to have executed people for watching banned videos from South Korea. More than 23,000 people were on death row by the end of last year and nearly 2,000 people were given death sentences in 57 countries in 2013."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/28/vladimir-putin-crimea-changed-world", "publicationDate": "2014-03-28T08:59:38Z", "tags": ["Vladimir Putin", "Russia", "Europe", "Nato", "World news", "Belarus"], "sentences": ["Beijing has always claimed Taiwan is part of the People&apos;s Republic of China, applying the irredentist principle that the Chinese-speaking peoples are an indivisible entity."], "title": "How Vladimir Putin's actions in Crimea changed the world", "article": "Nuclear bombshell Vladimir Putin&apos;s policies in the Soviet Union&apos;s former &quot;near abroad&quot; have gone hand in hand with an increasingly tough nuclear stance. The thaw of the US-Russian &quot;reset&quot; that led to the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New Start) in 2010 has passed and the disarmament process is largely frozen. The reductions in both countries&apos; strategic arsenals to the 1,550 deployed strategic warheads agreed four years ago do appear to be going ahead. But Putin has made clear that he has little interest in a more ambitious follow-on treaty that would have addressed the issue of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. The US has an estimated 150-200 such weapons: B61 gravity bombs, based in Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Turkey. Russia has 2,000 warheads for short-range missiles and artillery shells. Putin has cut off discussion on the subject and even raised the possibility of deploying nuclear-capable Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave between Poland and Lithuania. Putin wants to link negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons to the issue of US missile defence sites in Europe. Washington insists that the system under construction is only intended to defend against a putative Iranian and North Korean threat and the US has cancelled the last and most capable phase of the project, but the Russian leader has shown little interest in further discussion. Consequently, voices within Nato arguing for unilateral confidence building steps, such as the removal of the obsolescent B61 bombs from Europe, have been muffled, and in Congress there is more support for spending money on upgrading the US arsenal rather than on disarmament. Julian Borger Nato revival Putin&apos;s actions in Crimea have given Nato &quot;a shot in the arm&quot;, said a former British defence secretary, reflecting recent widespread concern about the future of the west&apos;s military alliance. The concern was that with Nato-sponsored combat operations in Afghanistan coming to an end this year, the alliance would have nothing to do and its west European members would make further cuts in their defence budgets. The hope in Nato headquarters is that Crimea and Ukraine will shake member governments out of what its officials regarded as complacency. &quot;After much agonising over Nato&apos;s purpose after Afghanistan, the Crimea crisis has given the alliance a new purpose,&quot; said Professor Malcolm Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute thinktank in London. He added: &quot;If Putin were to attack the territory of a Nato member state, like Poland or Latvia, other Nato states \u2013 including the UK \u2013 would be obligated to respond militarily.&quot; Barack Obama&apos;s message during his European trip this week was that Washington would stand by its security guarantees to Nato partners, notably post-Soviet states that joined the alliance. &quot;We will act in their defence against any threats,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s what Nato is all about.&quot; The British defence secretary, Philip Hammond, sang from the same hymn sheet during a visit to Washington. &quot;There should be no doubt,&quot; he said, &quot;about our resolve to defend Nato members.&quot; Nato will reassure its eastern allies by holding exercises and deploying fighters. The US is also using the crisis to galvanise west European Nato members to end their steady fall in defence spending. For the moment, however, there is huge relief they rejected calls for Ukraine to join Nato in 2008 when Russian was attacking Georgia over the status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Richard Norton-Taylor Will Belarus come in from the cold? Alexander Lukashenko, the strongman leader of Russia&apos;s neighbour and long-time ally Belarus, has been cool on Crimea joining Russia, saying the move sets a &quot;bad precedent&quot;. Belarus pointedly didn&apos;t send observers to Crimea&apos;s 15 March referendum on joining Russia, and Lukashenko has said he is ready to work with the new Kiev government, which Russia says is illegitimate. A visit to Minsk by a Nato delegation this week seemed to send a signal that Belarus, faced by increasingly aggressive Russian policy in the CIS, could move toward the west. The delegation discussed expanding Belarus&apos;s participation in UN peacekeeping and military exercises and arms purchases from the west, as well as the possible stationing of Nato aircraft in Belarus. But Lukashenko is a canny operator, and some believe he has no plans to leave Russia&apos;s camp \u2013 and merely wants to improve his negotiating position with Moscow. &quot;Lukashenko definitely wants to cash in on this crisis, and he wants to use it to make up with the west,&quot; said Yaroslav Romanchuk, a political and economic analyst in Belarus. &quot;At same time, he wants to not quarrel with Russia too much and make Russia pay for him staying around.&quot; The Belarusian president is at a &quot;crucial stage&quot; of negotiations to join the Eurasian Economic Union, the Russian-led alternative to the European Union, and Lukashenko&apos;s flirtations with the west will likely give him more bargaining power to remove trade barriers and seek a large loan from Russia, Romanchuk said. Lukashenko may also be hoping that the EU will finally recognise him as president after he runs for re-election next year. Belarus is economically dependent on Russia and is a transit hub for Russian oil sold to Europe. Its largest single source of income is selling refined petroleum made from subsidised Russian crude. Moscow-based political analyst Alexei Makarkin said the Nato negotiations were a way of &quot;gently indicating to Russia that he&apos;s an independent figure&quot;. Although Europe will likely continue to encourage Minsk to distance itself from Moscow, this won&apos;t lead to any concrete agreements, he predicted. &quot;He needs Russia to support him,&quot; Makarkin said. &quot;He needs to show that he&apos;s independent and that he controls entire situation in his country, that he&apos;s not an enemy of Russia.&quot; Alec Luhn in Moscow The siege of Londongrad Sanctions will only hit a few individuals for now, but Russians in London have worries for the future. The overall economic relationship between Britain and Russia is changing. The time when Russians would buy up a football club or a newspaper on an apparent whim are over. But that doesn&apos;t mean rich Russians will immediately rush for the exits. Some are predicting a subtle switch, with money pouring into art. &quot;When you feel yourself under the threat of financial sanctions and freezing of your bank accounts it is always easier to invest in a piece of art,&quot; said Svetlana Marich, international director of the Phillips auction house, which belongs to Moscow-based Mercury Group. &quot;Nobody could take a painting from your bedroom even if international sanctions are imposed against you.&quot; The multimillionaire owner of one of the most successful London restaurants, Arkady Novikov, said it would be a complete nonsense to stop doing business abroad because of the Ukrainian crisis. &quot;I do not think much about these sanctions. I am not a little girl to feel offended by them. Nobody tried to put pressure on me so far. Neither from one nor from the other side. I hope I will be able to continue to cheer up Russian and British audience in my restaurants in the UK and other parts of the world. Tensions will disappear, business will remain.&quot; &quot;Business people are always more optimistic than political analysts. Moreover, pragmatic uses of London will remain an attraction,&quot; says Alena Ledeneva, professor of politics and society at University College London. &quot;Sanctions are narrow and hit only a limited circle of people. They are not relevant for the default globalisation process of Russian business.&quot; Alexander Lebedev, the owner of the Evening Standard and Independent newspapers, says it would be naive to believe sanctions could prevent corrupt Russian money coming to London. &quot;We do not have another London to do business and invest in. British sanctions could not stop Russian kleptocracy from putting money here. As long as British lawyers are welcoming Russian dirty money and British government pays zero attention to this co-operation of Russian corruption and English law, nothing would change.&quot; &quot;You see only the surface of the iceberg and you see only the things we would like you to show.&quot; Tonia Samsonova, London correspondent for the Echo of Moscow radio station Fracking The bustup between the west and Russia over Crimea has been seized on by those in favour of fracking shale gas in Britain as a convenient new way of selling a potentially exciting \u2013 but controversial \u2013 new energy source. David Cameron took up the theme at a nuclear summit in The Hague this week, saying shale offered a &quot;good opportunity&quot; to strengthen the UK&apos;s energy self-reliance at a time of falling North Sea production. &quot;Energy independence, using all these different sources of energy, should be a tier-one political issue from now on, rather than tier five,&quot; he said echoing the positive noises coming out of the industry itself. The fact is that no one really knows how much shale gas will be found in Britain and how much will be exploitable at a commercial rate. The prime minister also overlooked the fact that numerous experts have warned that it could take many years of exploration and then development before this country has a resources that really makes a difference. Only a couple of large companies \u2013 Centrica and Total of France \u2013 have invested in the UK shale sector and their financial commitments have been tiny by their standards. Most environmentalists \u2013 and many locals living near potential fracking sites \u2013 raise concerns about chemical and water use and remain determined to try to halt any operations. But politicians in Europe are deeply aware that a shale gas &quot;revolution&quot; in North America has sent the price of natural gas spinning downwards, acting as a boost to economic activity and triggering a significant manufacturing revival. Up until now, the national security issues around having a domestic own power supply \u2013 independent of imports \u2013 have rarely been aired in favour of other power sources such as wind farms or even nuclear stations. But just as Ukraine and Poland have encouraged a shale search to loosen dependence on Russian gas, so now seemingly has Britain - even though little gas arrives here from Siberia. Terry Macalister Irredentist appointment Musing on Russia&apos;s annexation of Crimea, Strobe Talbott, foreign policy analyst and former US deputy secretary, sent an eye-catching tweet last week. He wrote: &quot;Thanks to Putin, musty word &apos;irredentism&apos;, coined by Italians in 19th &amp; early 20th century, is now all-too-relevant to new perils of 21st.&quot; Talbott was referring to the doctrine that a country is entitled to control areas or territories outside its borders to which it has an ethnic or historical claim. The word comes from the Italian for unredeemed \u2013 irredenta. The Italians patriots who came up with it were referring to Italian-speaking territories at the time under the control of the Austro-Hungarian empire (Trieste, Istria, Dalmatia and so on). Ever since, irredentism has frequently featured in territorial disputes, especially but not always in Europe. The doctrine&apos;s most brutal exponent, of course, was Hitler. The F\u00fchrer justified his annexation of Austria and the S\u00fcdetenland on the grounds that he was protecting ethnic Germans and incorporating them into Greater Germany. The 1938 Anschluss in Austria took place after a rigged referendum. Putin&apos;s audacious irredentist land-grab in Ukraine is the biggest geopolitical challenge for the west since the cold war. It has shaken the post-war consensus that Europe&apos;s borders are fixed, and has thrown up a series of major challenges for the US, the EU and Nato \u2013 defensive, cyber, energy. The question now is how far is Putin prepared to go to realise what looks like a plan to create a new Greater Russia? The obvious next target are the Russian-speaking areas of south and eastern Ukraine. Trans-Dniester \u2013 a Russian-speaking separatist territory and Soviet hangover next to Moldova \u2013 has already said it wants to join the Russian Federation. There are significant Russian-speaking populations in the Baltic states, and in post-Soviet central Asia, especially Kazakhstan. Seemingly, the Kremlin&apos;s annexation sets a military precedent for other major states with historical grudges to take matters into their own hands. China notably abstained on a motion by the US at the UN security council condemning Moscow&apos;s annexation of Crimea. Beijing has always claimed Taiwan is part of the People&apos;s Republic of China, applying the irredentist principle that the Chinese-speaking peoples are an indivisible entity. (For its part, China has Tibet \u2013 from Beijing&apos;s point of view a separatist or splittist rather than irredentist problem.) There are numerous other irredentist hotspots out there. Pakistan claims Indian-administered Kashmir on the grounds that it is the only state with a Muslim majority. Afghanistan&apos;s Pashtun tribes refuse to recognise the Durand line, drawn up by a British civil servant, and dividing Pakistan and Afghanistan. Argentina makes an irredentist case for the Malvinas or Falkland islands, on the grounds of historical justice and propinquity. But the population on the Falklands is resolutely British, making the ethnic argument tricky and allowing London to invoke self-determination. What conclusions should sovereign nations draw from the unhappy Crimea affair? With irrendentism back in fashion one is surely get yourself a nuclear weapon. And hang on to it.

We need a solution | Observer editorial", "article": "Getting other countries to do what you want is a basic aim of all governments and political leaders. In Brussels last week, Barack Obama suggested there were two ways to achieve it. One, which he favoured, employs diplomacy, persuasion, democratic accountability and other soft-power tools. The other, which he deplored, involves using &quot;brute force&quot;. Russia stands accused by the White House of resorting to the latter in Ukraine. Russia replies angrily that the US has double standards. What were the invasions of Iraq and Kosovo, if not the arbitrary, unsanctioned use of military might? That was totally different, say the Americans. The crux of this oversimplified debate is that agreement on when, how and why it is right for a country, or group of countries, or the &quot;international community&quot; to intervene in the affairs of a sovereign state is lacking. After the cold war, a loose consensus grew in western capitals around the idea of humanitarian intervention. Tony Blair, speaking in Chicago in 1999, revived the concept of the &quot;just war&quot;. In a globalised, interconnected world, he argued, nations should abandon the outdated principle of non-interference. Combining self-interest and moral purpose, they had a duty to defend and uphold universal values, including human rights. &quot;We are all internationalists now,&quot; he declared. The backdrop to the &quot;Blair doctrine&quot; was ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, but also the genocide that started 20 years ago in Rwanda, claiming up to a million lives. Former US president Bill Clinton and others in power at the time have since acknowledged that this slaughter could have been avoided and that military intervention would have been appropriate. As if learning this lesson, there followed, after Kosovo, relatively benign international interventions in East Timor and Sierra Leone. But then Blair, in collusion with George W Bush, wrecked his case, first in Afghanistan, then in Iraq. As Hamid Karzai prepares to depart the presidency and Nato troops pack up their kit, Afghanistan&apos;s future is again shrouded in fearful uncertainty. Departing countries such as Britain must meanwhile confront the uncomfortable question: what did we achieve? Even more so than Afghanistan, the Iraq intervention ultimately failed to satisfy Blair&apos;s five Chicago criteria for justified military intervention \u2013 is there a good case?; has diplomacy failed?; will military action succeed?; are we prepared to stick it out?; and does it serve our national interest? The Iraq trauma shattered the already frail international consensus around humanitarian intervention. Its questionable legality and high human and financial cost undermined trust and alienated support. In the west, war-weariness and wariness took deep hold. Others, such as the Russians, drew cynical conclusions. One consequence of Iraq has been the refusal by politicians and publics in the US and Britain to back intervention in Syria. In Syria, it might be persuasively argued, the case for forcibly halting President Bashar al-Assad&apos;s murderous war on his people, curbing dangerous region-wide destabilisation and preventing further radicalisation by hardline Islamists, is overwhelming. In Syria, each day, unnumbered innocents are killed, tortured, raped or maimed, as it were before our eyes. Yet our eyes are tight shut. In Egypt, too, where a military junta now repeats or surpasses the excesses of the Mubarak era, western intervention is not an issue, but that is because Washington much prefers Egypt&apos;s generals to the Muslim Brotherhood. This lack of real or meaningful consensus, let alone a rulebook, on international intervention accounts in part for the uproar over Russia&apos;s supposedly &quot;protective&quot; actions towards ethnic Russians in Crimea. Twisting the UN-guaranteed right to self-determination, Vladimir Putin decided he could do whatever he liked, just as, he argues, the US has done. The impact on Ukraine apart, such behaviour undermines the UN security council, charter, and other treaty pillars of the international system. And it invites emulation. Is Crimea, for example, now a precedent justifying a future Chinese invasion of Taiwan? All cases are different. But forging a new international consensus on the principles governing armed interventionism is an urgent challenge. As a starting point, the likely fulfilment of five criteria, significantly different from Blair&apos;s, should be considered. Those contemplating intervention must ask themselves: 1) Does such action have broad domestic and international support? 2) What exactly are its aims and are they realistic? 3) Is it legal? 4) Is it morally justified? And 5) How does it end?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/02/apple-in-talks-to-buy-smartphone-display-chip-company-renesas", "publicationDate": "2014-04-02T14:40:35Z", "tags": ["Apple", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Technology", "Business"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s Powerchip owns the remaining stake."], "title": "Apple in talks to buy smartphone display chip company Renesas", "article": "Renesas Electronics Corp is talking with Apple and other potential buyers of a stake in a smartphone display chip unit, as the struggling Japanese chipmaker restructures its business around the automotive industry, a source said.

Apple has been tightening control over its supply chain to keep up with main rival Samsung Electronics and stay ahead of fast-growing Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei Technologies. The US manufacturer was one of a number of companies Renesas met to discuss selling the stake, the source said on Wednesday. Renesas, which has racked up nearly 650bn yen ($6.28bn) in net losses during eight years in the red, said on Wednesday it was considering selling the unit but declined to comment further. The Japanese company could sell Apple its stake for 50bn yen by the summer, said the Nikkei business daily, which first reported on the talks with Apple. Japan&apos;s Sharp Corporatoin could also sell its 25% stake in the unit if requested to do so by Apple, the Nikkei said. Taiwan&apos;s Powerchip owns the remaining stake. Apple did not respond to an email request for comment. Shares of Renesas surged after the report by as much as 19% to 934 yen, their highest in more than three years. They had pulled back by early afternoon to 828 yen, up 5.6%, compared with a 1.2% rise in the benchmark index. Renesas, formed from the struggling chip divisions of three Japanese electronics conglomerates, received a 150bn yen bailout in September from major customers and a government-led fund, countering a bid by US private equity firm KKR &amp; Co LP .

Take the bloody bouts and broken noses of the boxing ring and the rarefied arenas of dance and classical music \u2013 in the eyes of choreographer Mourad Merzouki, they&apos;re not so far apart. In Merzouki&apos;s latest show, Boxe Boxe, he melds boxing, hip-hop dance and classical harmonies into whimsical entertainment. As the protagonists come into the ring (complete with stripe-shirted umpire), boxing mitts turn into glove puppets, a dancer&apos;s body curves in a feline swoop only to be caught in a firm headlock, and limbs jab, swipe and kick while a string quartet roams the stage playing Schubert and Ravel, turning this fight club into something fantastical. &quot;Muhammad Ali said himself that he was a dancer before being a boxer,&quot; says Merzouki, a French-Algerian from the suburbs of Lyon, who founded Compagnie K\u00e4fig in 1996 (K\u00e4fig means cage in both German and Arabic, which brings to mind a different kind of fighting). With a background in martial arts, as well as circus and hip-hop, Merzouki has always seen the shared ground between boxing and dance. &quot;I was interested in the fact that boxing is not only a violent sport \u2013 it is also full of poetry and drama and rhythm and it is very close to dance,&quot; he says. &quot;I wanted to show how dance could be physical but also how boxing could be poetic.&quot;            Reading on mobile? Click here to view Once you get down to it, boxing and dance have plenty in common. Both are gruelling physical disciplines, for a start, but whereas one is overt about inflicting pain, the other hides the grim realities beneath a veneer of beauty, form and finesse. Bruises, sprains and injuries all go unseen. &quot;Dancers and boxers are both facing pain,&quot; says Merzouki. &quot;The dancers are usually exhausted. Their feet are destroyed. The violence we demand of dancers is very similar to that of boxers, but we don&apos;t see it the same way.&quot; For Boxe Boxe, Compagnie K\u00e4fig&apos;s dancers trained in the French boxing style of savate, which uses the feet as well as the fists. R\u00e9mi Autechaud, a hip-hop dancer and long-time Compagnie K\u00e4fig member, was suspicious at first. &quot;My family are all boxers but I had a bad opinion of it, fighting another guy,&quot; he says. &quot;But now I know that the technique, the respect for your opponent, is just like hip-hop.&quot;     Full swing \u2026 Mourad Merzouki's Boxe Boxe. Photograph: Donald Cooper    It mattered to the dancers that they looked credible, that anyone who knew about boxing would be convinced by their poses. So to make it authentic, did they have to find their inner aggression, too? &quot;No, it&apos;s not real aggression,&quot; says dancer Aur\u00e9lien Desobry. &quot;You play your character. You have to make it sharp, fast and explosive.&quot; But Desobry did find the sense of confrontation in boxing familiar. &quot;You fight against someone in boxing like in dance you fight against the audience,&quot; he says. You fight against the audience? &quot;I mean, it&apos;s like a confrontation. You have to surpass yourself, to have a lot of virtuosity when you dance. You have to impress them. In battle it&apos;s the same thing: you have to be the best.&quot; Desobry&apos;s not the only one to bring up this idea of a battle between performer and audience. &quot;The will for victory is the same,&quot; says Merzouki. &quot;The dancer wants to win over its audience, the critics; the dancer has to face the curtain, the pressure, the stress, as the boxer faces his opponent.&quot;     Boxe Boxe Photograph: Donald Cooper    Merzouki doesn&apos;t seem to be fighting too many critics. Although Compagnie K\u00e4fig haven&apos;t often performed in the UK, they clock up more than 100 shows a year in France and abroad. Forty-year-old Merzouki has been awarded national honours the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and the L\u00e9gion d&apos;honneur. In 2009 he launched the P\u00f4le Pik choreography centre in Lyon, dedicated to pushing hip-hop as a serious artform. He is now director of the National Choreographic Centre in Cr\u00e9teil, in the suburbs of Paris. Merzouki is not an issues-driven choreographer \u2013 &quot;Because I come from circus, my first aim is to entertain,&quot; he says \u2013 but his company demonstrates the values he cares about, particularly integration across geographical and social boundaries, and he has collaborated on work with dancers in Brazil, China and Taiwan. In Boxe Boxe the boundaries are those of culture and, perhaps, class, and audiences seem to have been happy to traverse them. Violinist Christophe Collette of the Debussy Quartet remembers a well-to-do 84-year-old woman who came as a guest of a sponsor, dubious about what she was going to see, and left the theatre raving about hip-hop dance. Then there are the hip-hop fans getting turned on to classical music. &quot;I was in the hall after the show,&quot; says Collette, &quot;and a young boy in a baseball cap came up to me and asked what the music was at the end. I told him it was Schubert. The boy said, &apos;When&apos;s his next concert? I want to go and listen to him.&apos; I said, &apos;I&apos;m sorry, he died 200 years ago.&apos;&quot; They make it sound like a cultural utopia, with everyone discovering and appreciating each other&apos;s worlds. &quot;Even after 150 shows we have the same pleasure performing together as the first time,&quot; says Collette. &quot;I can&apos;t feel any tension in the group.&quot; Presumably because they&apos;re boxing it all out in the ring. \u2022 Compagnie K\u00e4fig&apos;s Boxe Boxe is on tour until 18 April and will be staged at the People&apos;s Palace in London on 13 and 14 June in partnership with Spitalfields music festival.

Whether it be 100 years since the outbreak of the First World War, 70 years since D-Day or 50 years since Martin Luther King&apos;s &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech, you can guarantee that newspapers, TV and radio will find new ways to retell the story. It can be an opportunity to reassess our notion of history, as we are seeing currently with debates on the causes and consequences of the Great War, or a chance to revisit the achievements of a life and to ask what might have been, as the media did with the 50th anniversary of the assassination of John F Kennedy. But not every anniversary has the same resonance. Twenty years ago yesterday, Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain took his own life at the age of 27. You can hardly miss this fact at the moment; most newspapers have referred to it in pieces on his music and the influence he has had on a generation of musicians. But there are dangers lurking here. If there is one thing we have learned in the past 20 years it is that the media need to tread very carefully when talking about suicide, and particularly celebrity suicide. Last week, the Observer New Review chose to mark the anniversary with a jokey quiz entitled &quot;How much do you know about Kurt Cobain and Nirvana?&quot;. It didn&apos;t dwell on the suicide or the method involved but declaring it as the reason for running the quiz goes against the spirit of much that has been achieved in reducing copycat suicide among the vulnerable young. A 2006 report into the effects of media coverage in Taiwan following a celebrity suicide found that of 124 suicide attempters interviewed, 23.4% said that media reports had influenced them. And a study from the Wayne State University, Detroit, shows that suicide figures leapt 12% in the month following Marilyn Monroe&apos;s death in 1962. The same report concludes that studies measuring the effect of either an entertainment or political celebrity suicide story were 14.3 times more likely to find a copycat effect than other suicide studies. Samaritans remind us that suicide accounts for more deaths than road traffic accidents, particularly in people under the age of 35. They have done much to make the media aware of the effect of insensitive reporting, producing very clear guidelines that state: &quot;There may be a higher risk of unintentionally glamorising suicide in the case of celebrities or high-profile individuals... Various characteristics of the reporting of suicide are thought to increase the risk of imitative or &apos;copycat&apos; behaviour. These include: information about the method of suicide, prominent or repetitive reporting, or where the person involved is a celebrity. Young people are particularly vulnerable to &apos;copycat&apos; suicides. Research shows they are the group most likely to be influenced by the media.&quot; Media references to Cobain&apos;s suicide certainly come under the heading of repetitive: a database search of all national newspapers reveals that 237 pieces have been published in the past year, which, coupled with similar articles in magazines and online, reinforce the myths that surround young death and help create such questionable phenomena as the 27 Club \u2013 an online litany of musicians who have died, either by their own hand, accidentally or as murder victims, at the age of 27. They include Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison and, most recently, Amy Winehouse. Eminent figures such as Professor Keith Hawton of Oxford University have been warning the media for years about copycat suicide. We need to remember that one in six of those who read newspapers and watch TV has a mental health problem and that 6,000 people take their lives every year \u2013 that&apos;s 16 families bereaved every day. The recent outcry against coverage of the death of designer L&apos;Wren Scott illustrates that the media still have much to learn. And in case we think that the copycat effect is something new, Goethe&apos;s The Sorrows of Young Werther, in which the young hero takes his own life, was banned across Europe after it was thought to have sparked imitative deaths in Italy, Germany and Denmark. And that was in 1774. samaritans.org reader@observer.co.uk"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/apr/07/apple-samsung-chromebook", "publicationDate": "2014-04-07T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google", "Chromebook"], "sentences": ["And from a separate Digitimes story:   Global Chromebook shipments in 2014 are expected to reach only 4-5m units mainly because cloud-based storage is not popular enough and 4G mobile access is not sufficiently available, according to Taiwan-based supply chain makers\u2026 The sources pointed out that Chromebooks were unable to reproduce the same sales phenomenon as netbooks because of the popularity of mobile devices."], "title": "Boot up: life inside Apple.

Speakers; When is good enough, enough &gt;&gt; Audioholics From the forums, meet Bob Dean, who tried a blind listening test:   We gathered up a 5 of our audio buddies. We took my &quot;old&quot; Martin Logan SL-3 (not a bad speaker for accurate noise making) and hooked them up with Monster 1000 speaker cables (decent cables according to the audio press). We also rigged up 14 gauge, oxygen free Belden stranded copper wire with a simple PVC jacket. Both were 2 meters long. They were connected to an ABX switch box allowing blindfold testing. Volume levels were set at 75 Db at 1000K Hz. A high quality recording of smooth, trio, easy listening jazz was played (Piano, drums, bass). None of us had heard this group or CD before, therefore eliminating biases. The music was played. Of the 5 blind folded, only 2 guessed correctly which was the monster cable. (I was not one of them). This was done 7 times in a row! Keeping us blindfolded, my brother switched out the Belden wire (are you ready for this) with simple coat hanger wire!  You&apos;ll never guess what happened next.. actually, you will. Eco-system is the key for Smart Device multi-screen strategy &gt;&gt; Kantar Worldpanel  The recent Kantar Worldpanel ComTech report shows, by December 2013, amongst Apple, Samsung and Lenovo tablet users in Urban China, over 62% own a smartphone device. This ratio is particularly high for Apple iPad users at 80.9%, followed by Samsung with 56.9%, which is slightly higher than Lenovo&apos;s 42.6%. If we look at tablet penetration by mobile phone brands, 35.4% iPhone users own a tablet, and Samsung and Lenovo mobile users have a tablet penetration of 19.3% and 14.9% respectively. Therefore, in comparison, iPad users are more likely to use a smartphone device, and tablet penetration is higher for iPhone users. This implies the high cost of Apple products naturally recruits high value customers and they are more likely to lead the trend of multi-screen adoption.  Or, paraphrased, &quot;comparatively rich people buy comparatively expensive stuff&quot;. But Android&apos;s interchangeability poses a problem for Samsung achieving the double in the same way, Kantar says.

The protesters first demanded that the party review the pact line by line, then later that it rescind the pact and establish a public oversight mechanism for future cross-strait trade agreements. The occupation fanned out into a larger movement on 30 March. According to police, 116,000 demonstrators filled the streets around the legislature while protest organisers estimated the turnout at between 350,000 and 500,000. The protesters, who call themselves the Sunflower Movement, have remained largely peaceful and well-organised, despite brief clashes with riot police late last month.

Play on the fears of politicians At the very core of the campaign for HS2 was a very simple message to politicians: modern, successful countries have high-speed rail everywhere. We don&apos;t. If you want to be a modern and successful country, you need a high-speed rail network. The fear of falling behind is catnip to politicians and HS2 made sure it milked it as much as possible, showcasing the economic impact of successful high-speed rail projects in China, South Korea and Taiwan. So what can the museum lobby learn from this? Our messaging needs to be equally simple: large, mature economies invest in culture because it keeps them competitive. If you let the museum infrastructure of 150 years (the envy of the rest of the world) crumble, our kids will fall behind and it will be your fault. Build on what came before HS1 is the high-speed rail network that connects St Pancras in London with Kent, the Channel tunnel and Europe. It expanded the infrastructure of the old domestic rail network, creating a new line that eased congestion and provided a new route for trade and tourism. Critically, the advocates of HS2 were able to point to the undoubted success of HS1 and say: that worked, now we want to do more of that for more of the country. The UK museum sector can point to the tremendous advances and audience benefits achieved under Renaissance in the Regions and say: &quot;That worked, and we can do it again. Not only that, you can trust us to do it again, because we did it before, and we&apos;ll do it even better this time because of everything we learned last time.&quot; Show the impact and be prepared to back it up HS2&apos;s advocates pitched the government for support on the basis that it would generate \u00a359.8bn in &quot;user benefits&quot; and \u00a313.3bn in wider economic benefits. That&apos;s a cool \u00a373.1bn in combined benefits against an investment of just \u00a343bn \u2013 almost double your money. What&apos;s a user benefit? I don&apos;t know, but that&apos;s an awfully good return on investment for public subsidy. How did they reach that figure? Some very clever people crunched numbers on HS1 and came up with a document on its economic impact (pdf). HS2 took the same metrics and extrapolated them across a wider area. Perhaps we could get a similarly clever group of people to crunch the numbers on the economic impact of previous Renaissance investment and then extrapolate that up to what a Renaissance 2 could deliver. Be united Who are these mysterious &quot;advocates of HS2&quot; mentioned throughout this post? I don&apos;t know and haven&apos;t been able to find out, which is the point. I&apos;m sure that they are a ragbag of interest groups, train companies, operators, investors and consumer action groups. The point is that none of those partisan interests matters. One brand, one coherent message. Sometimes, the collective benefit massively outweighs whatever specific message you are trying to get across. Renaissance had formal support from lots of sector organisations and groups. Did they all agree about the priorities and problems? No, but they knew that it was in their collective interest to park their opinions for long enough to get the policy through parliament and release the money. Want it Let&apos;s face it, HS2 was hard work. All that lobbying, consultation, fundraising, engagement, planning and branding must have been exhausting. Someone, somewhere, really wanted it to happen. They had enough vision and commitment to ignore serious concerns, the advice scientists, public opinion and being pilloried in the press. They must have been absolutely committed to the idea that HS2 needed to happen to benefit the whole of the country. The world runs on energy and any serious campaign for museum funding needs to be led, driven and dragged by someone with clarity, vision and singularity of purpose. Who is there in today&apos;s generation that wants it enough to make it happen?

But in a blogpost after the interview he insisted that &quot;I want to assure [customers] that I have no intention of selling off or abandoning this business any time soon. I know you still love your BlackBerry devices\u2026 we will do everything in our power to continue to rebuild this business,&quot; he added. &quot;Rest assured, we continue to fight.&quot; He suggested to Reuters that it should be possible to make money from as few as 10m shipments per year. That compares to the company&apos;s peak in its fiscal 2011 year, when it shipped 52.3m and recorded an operating profit of $4.6bn.  By contrast in its just-ended fiscal year to the end of February, it shipped 13.7m handsets, but recorded operating losses of nearly $7bn, including around $3.7bn in writedowns on unsold inventory of its newer BB10 handsets. But Richard Windsor of the Radio Free Mobile consultancy warned that &quot;Chen thinks he can make money shipping 10m units a year. This looks like a tall order given that Android vendors Huawei and LG Electronics are struggling to keep their heads above water shipping 50m smartphone units last year.&quot;  Windsor suggested that &quot;the [BlackBerry] handset business is likely to fail no matter what [Chen] does. The handset business takes no prisoners when it comes to profitability and BlackBerry is one of the weakest, most vulnerable players out there.&quot; Chen has already outsourced the manufacture of handsets to Taiwan&apos;s Foxconn as a cost-saving measure.  Pricing advantage However BlackBerry could have a pricing advantage as Chen focuses on corporate and government customers, its original core business. Many, including high-level government users, have become highly dependent on its security, which could mean that the company effectively has a captive market. BlackBerry&apos;s BB7 and BB10 software is the only one approved for use in more secure government systems for documents above the &quot;Restricted&quot; level. Chen, who took over in November 2013 having previously engineered a turnaround at software company Sybase, said BlackBerry was also looking to invest in or team up with other companies in regulated industries such as healthcare, and financial and legal services, all of which require highly secure communications. Small acquisitions to strengthen its network security offerings were also possible, he said. &quot;We are building an engineering team on the service side that is focused on security. We are building an engineering team on the device side that is focused on security. We will do some partnerships and we will probably, potentially do an M&amp;A [merger and acquisition] on security.&quot; He said security had become more important to businesses and government since the revelations about US surveillance made by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. Chen acknowledged past management mistakes and said he had a long-term strategy to complement the short-term goals of staying afloat and stemming customer defections. &quot;You have to live short term. Maybe the prior management had the luxury to bet the world would come to it. I don&apos;t have the luxury at all. I&apos;m losing money and burning cash.&quot; In March, the embattled smartphone maker reported a quarterly net loss of $423m and a 64% drop in its revenues to below $1bn for the quarter, the first time it had been so low since 2007. It also saw cash outflow of around $500m. That underscored the magnitude of the challenge Chen faces. Chen said BlackBerry remains on track to be cash-flow positive by the end of the current fiscal year, which runs to the end of February 2015, and to return to profit some time in the fiscal year after that. Lone survivor? Windsor warned that without the handset business, BlackBerry will be thrown back onto its pure software and services business - and will be competing with &quot;mobile device management&quot; (MDM) companies such as Airwatch, Mobile Iron and Good Technology, which are all aiming to provide security services for smartphones and tablets used in businesses, but apply them to iPhones and Android phones as well as BlackBerrys. &quot;I doubt whether BlackBerry will survive on its own as a pure MDM vendor,&quot; Windsor said. Chen said his long-term plans for BlackBerry included competing in the burgeoning business of connecting all manner of devices, from kitchen appliances to automotive consoles to smartphones. Chen said he was not sure how long it would take for the &quot;machine-to-machine&quot; or &quot;M2M&quot; world to become a mainstream business, but he said he was sure that was coming. &quot;We are not only interested in managing BlackBerry devices. We are interested in managing all devices that you would like to speak to each other,&quot; he said. &quot;To achieve our dream of being a major player in M2M requires more partnerships with others,&quot; including telecom companies eager to participate. Chen was recruited by the board last November after attempts to find a buyer for the company last summer foundered, and its then-chief executive and former chief operating officer Thorsten Heins was fired, having overseen the late release of BB10-powered phones - which flopped in the market. BBM promise Chen said he was not fazed by recent acquisitions of companies offering similar services to BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), such as Facebook&apos;s $19bn purchase of mobile messaging service Whatsapp. &quot;We are not going to go up against Whatsapp. We are going to be more focused on secure communications, secure messaging,&quot; he said of BBM. Chen said he was determined not to lose focus on the corporate and other customers that helped it build its global reach in the first place, and would not be tempted back into the much larger but more fickle consumer smartphone race. &quot;We are not going to spend any more money to maintain the latest version of Angry Birds,&quot; Chen said, referring to the popular consumer mobile video game. \u2022 BlackBerry hangs up on T-Mobile US after spat between chief executives"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/11/end-of-window-xp-support-fails-to-lift-figures-for-declining-pc-market", "publicationDate": "2014-04-11T07:08:18Z", "tags": ["Computing", "Internet", "Tablet computers", "Technology", "Software", "Windows"], "sentences": ["Both agreed that China&apos;s Lenovo remained at the top of the business, ahead of HP, and that Taiwan&apos;s Acer saw a falloff in sales of between 15% and 20% compared to last year, though it remained in fourth place worldwide behind Dell."], "title": "End of Windows XP support fails to lift figures for declining PC market", "article": "The personal computer market shrank for the eighth quarter in a row in the first three months of the year, despite commercial buyers upgrading machines to escape the end of support for Windows XP.

'Other' PC makers (excluding Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus and Acer) as percentage of Windows PC shipments since 3Q 1998. Source: IDC. Photograph: /PR    The pressure on consumer-focussed PC makers is growing Acer has been struggling to regain profitability, while Asus reported first-quarter revenue down 3%, though it has not yet disclosed profits. However Asus leads the market for &quot;hybrid&quot; computers which combine tablet and notebook functionality, said IDC. IDC doesn&apos;t include tablets with detachable keyboard such as Microsoft&apos;s Surface in its PC figures. Mikako Kitagawa at Gartner forecast that as tablet penetration hits 50% in the US later this year some consumers could start to look again at PC buying.  Growing pressure For smaller PC makers, the intensifying pressure on profit margins in the consumer PC business has already forced Sony into quitting the business, with the buyer deciding to retreat to Japan. Korea&apos;s LG is also mulling a withdrawal as its home government cuts back on PC purchases. &quot;As well as Acer and Asus, only Apple, Toshiba, Samsung, Sony and Fujitsu had single-digit market share in 2013 - together capturing 31.4% of the market,&quot; Loren Loverde of IDC told the Guardian. &quot;Sony and Fujitsu were the smallest of these top vendors, with 2.5% and 2.2% of global shipments in 2013, each about half of Samsung&apos;s volume.&quot; Apple is slightly larger than Samsung, with about 5% of shipments. Analysts expect that the prolonged slump in consumer buying of PCs will create more pressure on smaller PC makers, and lead to mergers or exits, much as happened around 2000 when market conditions changed and forced the exit of Gateway and a number of other vendors. A key driver during the quarter was companies replacing ageing PCs as Windows XP approached the end of Microsoft support at the start of April. That drove growth among business buyers in the developed world, where the installed base of PCs is larger and older. &quot;The upside in the first quarter arose primarily from demand in mature commercial markets. Commercial refresh projects, which had already been protracted, received a last push from the impending end of Windows XP support, particularly in Japan,&quot; IDC noted. For Gartner, Isabelle Durand, principal research analyst, said: \u201cThe end of support for Windows XP has boosted commercial desktop sales, driven in part by delayed government buying in major western European countries. The professional PC market looks stronger overall, as business and governments adjust to a more favorable economic environment. We also expect to see the impact of XP migration to continue throughout 2014.\u201d But in the Asia/Pacific region, where PCs are comparatively newer and the installed base smaller, saw shipments decline by more than 10%. Stagnant The US market was stagnant, with shipments of around 14m; IDC reckoned it shrank slightly, while Gartner figured it saw a 2.1% increase. Apple, Toshiba and makers outside the three big corporate suppliers - HP, Dell and Lenovo - all saw year-on-year declines. But &quot;the passing boost from XP replacements, constrained consumer demand, and no clear driver of a market rebound are expected to keep growth below zero going forward,&quot; said Rajani Singh, IDC&apos;s senior research analyst for personal computing. Desktop, laptop and ultrabook sales have been in a prolonged slump for two years as consumers have turned to smartphones, tablets and &quot;phablets&quot; to accomplish computing tasks at home and on the move. With consumer sales previously making up half of the PC business, that has intensified competition among PC makers for corporate contracts, which are often less profitable. \u2022 PCs lumber towards the technological graveyard"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/19/rana-plaza-bangladesh-one-year-on", "publicationDate": "2014-04-19T05:00:00Z", "tags": ["Bangladesh", "World news", "Business", "Fashion industry", "Rana Plaza"], "sentences": ["Through the 50s and 60s, producers hunted cheaper labour in east Asia \u2013 first Japan and then, in the 70s and 80s, in the so-called Asian Tiger economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan."], "title": "Rana Plaza: one year on from the Bangladesh factory disaster", "article": "For a very brief moment, just before daybreak, the narrow backstreets are empty. Trucks still rumble down the potholed road through the town but the last workers have long gone home, walking past the furled awnings of the market stalls, over the single footbridge, along the battered pavements, to the tenement apartments, the squalid huts, the\u00a0tin-roofed homes by the fetid pond. Then, as light comes, the silence is broken: water splashes into a bucket held under a standpipe by a child, a pressure cooker wails, someone laughs. In thousands of homes, tens of thousands of people are scooping rice and vegetables from tin bowls, packing the leftovers to eat during the long day ahead and then, hands rinsed, goodbyes said, filing out into the streets, the streams of workers uniting and then separating as they flow through the town, like blood through veins, each leading to a different factory. In the evening the flow will reverse, the pulse slower, less certain. But now, at\u00a07.30am, it is sure and steady. On this morning, 23 April last year and the day before the disaster, the workers at the five factories housed in the eight-storey Rana Plaza arrive as usual around 7.45am. There are 2,200 registered employees in the complex, plus those who staff the bank and the shops on the first floor. Once through the doors at the rear, they head up the narrow stairs to their workplaces: New Wave Bottoms on the second floor, Phantom Apparels on the third, Phantom Tac on the fourth, then Ether Tex and finally New Wave Style on the sixth and seventh floors. For several years now, these five companies have produced millions of items of clothing for western clients including Matalan and Primark. Among the workers is Mahmuda Akhter. Her husband, Habibullah, works in the Phantom Tac factory a floor above, and as usual the couple have walked to work together, leaving their baby girl at\u00a0home with Mahmuda&apos;s mother. They are from a small village in Pabna district 100 miles from Savar. Unusually for conservative Bangladesh, theirs is a &quot;love marriage&quot;, not arranged by their parents. Mahmuda is 20; Habibullah, 23. Mahmuda reaches her sewing machine and sits\u00a0down. A few yards away is Shapla Begum, a\u00a0supervisor working on another of the three lines, each of around 80 sewing machine operators, that constitute Phantom Apparels. Shapla is 27 and has been in Savar for five years. She, too, is a migrant. Her husband&apos;s earnings as a rickshaw puller in their village in Kurigram in the distant north were insufficient to pay for schooling for their two boys so, following other relatives, they came to Savar. Working for Ether Tex on the fifth floor are Runarini and her two daughters. Runarini is a\u00a0&quot;helper&quot;, cleaning and carrying, as is the younger of the two girls, Preity, who is 15. The elder, 18-year-old Shamapati, a serious girl who laughs rarely, says little and works hard, is a\u00a0sewing machine operator. The trio have arrived in Savar more recently than most of their colleagues and so can afford only a single room in\u00a0a battered, tin-roofed shack. They hope that in time they will find something better. The open yard full of chickens and children in front of their new home reminds Preity of the fields and trees she left behind, and of the friends she misses.     Mahmuda Akhter, with her mother and daughter. Her husband, Habibullah, who also worked at Rana Plaza, was killed. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    But she likes Shonjit Das, the 19-year-old son of\u00a0her immediate neighbour. He works in the finishing section of Ether Tex, packing the clothes to be sent off to the west, and is handsome and funny, and sometimes walks her home at the end of the day. And she knows the three women are earning many times what labouring in others&apos; fields or cultivating their own poor, eroded land back in their village would ever have paid. At 8am, as every morning except Sundays, in all the factories, on every floor of the Rana Plaza, the bell sounds, conversation ends and work starts. No one is entirely sure how big the global clothing industry is, what profit it makes or how many it employs. It is estimated that $300bn worth of clothes were made by the top 10 producers in 2012, and the industry as a whole generates revenues of between $500m and $2tn. But no one really knows. Textiles, if not garments, have always been a\u00a0key element of global commerce. For more than a thousand years, trade between Europe and east Asia travelled what were known as the &quot;silk routes&quot;. Later, the textile industry played an important role in Britain&apos;s emergence as the world&apos;s leading commercial power. There and elsewhere, the rag trade employed millions and created immense wealth, playing a key role in the transition of western nations from agrarian to industrial economies. But nothing really compares with what is happening today, either in scale or in impact. For as the west has got richer, its demand for clothes has steadily risen. Garment-making is labour-intensive and there is often little room for savings on the textiles that are the biggest single cost. This means the price of a human being cutting, making and trimming a garment is key in the overall production costs and, of course, eventual profits. Through the 50s and 60s, producers hunted cheaper labour in east Asia \u2013 first Japan and then, in the 70s and 80s, in the so-called Asian Tiger economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. Employment in the garment manufacturing industry in the west has declined steadily decade on decade \u2013 despite attempts to protect local industries with quota systems and tariffs. Production in newly industrialised China, as well as in Indonesia, Turkey, Mexico and India, has increased exponentially. For the consumer, of course, this has all meant that while prices of everything else except communications have risen, clothes cost less. In 1900, 15% of a US household&apos;s income was spent on clothing. In 1950, it was still 12%. Even as late as the early 1990s, major purchases of clothing \u2013 a\u00a0suit, a dress, a coat \u2013 marked a special occasion or a rite of passage. But by 2004, the total amount spent by households on clothes had dropped to just 4%. By 2010, according to the US Bureau of Labour Statistics, clothing cost the average American family only $1,700 (\u00a31,017), 2.8% of their income. And for that money the consumer gets much more. Cheap no longer means nasty; it just means affordable. In 1997, the average woman in\u00a0the UK bought 19 items of clothing a year; in\u00a02007, she bought 34. The big bang in recent textile history came in a few short years at the beginning of the last decade, when various factors coincided to change radically the nature and scale of garment production around the planet. One was the end of the quota system put in place 30 years earlier to protect western industries. A second was a\u00a0new degree of\u00a0conformity of tastes across the world, allowing greater uniformity of product and bigger volumes of single designs. A third was &quot;fast fashion&quot;.     Volunteers and rescue workers search the rubble for trapped factory employees. Photograph: Palash Khan/Sipa USA /REX    Fast fashion is at once a mode of production, a\u00a0strategy and a style. It grew out of the efforts of\u00a0the major western brands, which dominate garment sales, to find new ways to coax further demand out of a saturated market. Though soon adopted by retailers across the world, it was pioneered by Inditex, the giant Spanish company that owns Zara. It depends on a\u00a0series of mutually reinforcing innovations: an accelerated cycle of design, production and supply that means trends can be spotted, copied and sold within weeks; no &quot;seasons&quot;, but a year-round product flow; low stock levels in stores to encourage rapid, repeated impulse purchases; a\u00a0supply chain that can respond when shop staff notice that shoppers suddenly seem to like lace, or blue, or diamond patterns, or a particular stitching on their socks, or whatever; huge numbers of young adults for whom shopping is the primary leisure activity; a\u00a0new obsession with celebrities, fuelled by social media and the internet; and, of course, low prices. Sourcing has thus become a complex operation in which scores of different factors \u2013 cost, location, eventual market, risk, competition, styling, quality and so on \u2013 are computed to decide on an\u00a0eventual place of production. Basic clothing \u2013 socks, for example \u2013 will be ordered in huge quantities with long lead times. Higher quality workmanship will be done in Europe, north Africa or, for the US market, Latin America. More fashion-led items are often needed in smaller quantities but faster. And cost, whatever the brands say, is always the prime consideration. So\u00a0in this highly networked system, places where suppliers can turn around vast quantities of clothing very rapidly and very cheaply are key. Places where you can order, say, 500,000 basic shirts, paying $6 per piece, and they will be shipped on time, with minimum fuss, and be in stores, retailing for $30, within, at the outside, two to three months. Places such as Bangladesh. Mahmuda and her husband are standing in a crowd of workers outside the Rana Plaza complex. They have been there for nearly 40\u00a0minutes and now 2,000 people are massed around the building. Shapla is there, too, and Preity, her mother and sister, and Shonjit, her 19-year-old friend. There is\u00a0a low murmur of discontent and concern. It is 24 April. The previous day, shortly after work started, three cracks were found in the reinforced concrete pillars that support the eight-storey building. An engineer sent by the Savar municipality declared the building unsafe, work in the five factories was halted and everyone was sent home. Mahmuda&apos;s job is to stitch seams and pockets. It is one of the tougher of the 60 or 70 separate operations needed to make a pair of trousers. She is supposed to stitch 120 pairs an hour, 10 hours a day, six days a week, 50 weeks of the year. That&apos;s 360,000 annually. She earns 8,000BDT (\u00a360) each month. Her husband, a quality controller, earns a little more. Each line in Mahmuda&apos;s factory is watched over by three supervisors. Shapla is one of only a handful who are women. She is paid 10,000BDT (\u00a375) for monitoring the 15 workers and five helpers on her section, but gets no overtime. The line&apos;s target and their progress is indicated on a board hung on the wall above the output bins where the finished clothes are dropped. The workers get an hour off for lunch. The boss &quot;is a\u00a0well-mannered person&quot; and there are no complaints, or at least not from Shapla&apos;s section. If an order is delivered late, accepted practice in much of the industry is for the buyer to deduct 5% for each week of delay. The buyers already have political unrest, wildcat strikes and blockades to deal with; they cannot afford to risk losing further days of production. And that is what they are facing now.     Satyadip lost his 19-year-old son, Shonjit, in the building collapse. Photograph: David Levene  for the Guardian    Which may explain how, somehow, overnight, the cracks that shut the factory the day before have become less dangerous and the management has called in the workforce. The building has been inspected once more and is safe, they say. Monthly salaries are due in 10 days, but overtime, which increases most employees&apos; salaries by between a\u00a0third and\u00a0a\u00a0half, and means being able to pay the rent\u00a0or eat properly, will be paid in the next day or so. Many of the workers are told by their managers that unless they work, they will not receive the money. What choice have we got, the workers are saying to each other. We are here to work, after all. The managers know this. They know, too, that, as a female supervisor, Shapla is trusted more than her male counterparts, and not just by &quot;her girls&quot;. So when they want the workers to stop shouting and calm down, and to enter the building, take their places at their machines and finish the big orders the factories are currently under pressure to complete on time, several come to her, telling her again how the building is safe, how the girls trust her, how if she doesn&apos;t go in, the girls won&apos;t either. She is uncertain, reluctant, but because at that moment it is the easiest thing to do, she gives way and goes in. And her girls follow. Similar pressure has been put on other supervisors. They, too, reluctantly head into the\u00a0building. Soon all the workers are flowing up the stairs. Mahmuda leaves her husband in the stairwell. He carries on up to his factory. She makes her way to her desk and machine on the third floor. On the fifth floor, in the Ether Tex factory, 15-year-old Preity, her mother and her sister are working by 8.30am. Preity is on her feet, moving up and down the line, clearing offcuts, bringing new needles or thread; her mother is nearby, her sister working at a sewing machine on the same line but at the opposite end of the room. Mahmuda has time to stitch maybe two or three pieces before the lights go out, the old fans, which barely dent the heat in the factory, slow and the sewing machines stop. A power cut, frequent enough and no cause for alarm. The workers wait in the gloom, talking quietly, worried, waiting for the powerful, heavy generators installed on the roof to start up. Moments after the generators start, sending vibrations through the building, a pillar in one corner of the Rana Plaza gives way with a loud, explosive bang. Then each storey slides sideways, tips and splits, falling in on the one below. On the third floor, the collapse is almost instantaneous, but the workers of Phantom Apparels still have time to realise what is happening. The floor starts shaking and it is clear the building is coming down. Mahmuda starts reciting verses of the Qur&apos;an. She staggers, falls and crawls beneath her sewing machine. Shapla is walking down her line when the building starts to collapse. She starts running. She, too, seeks protection under a sewing machine and then everything gives way around her. She is in darkness, gasping for breath. Two floors above, the floor inclines slowly like the deck of a sinking ship. Panicked workers rush to the two narrow exits. It is dark, there is much dust and noise. Runarini has managed to find her youngest daughter, Preity, and is now trying to get to the other end of her line where Shamapati, her eldest, was working at her machine. But the force of bodies pushes her towards the exit. She cannot hold on to Preity and fight the crowd to find Shamapati. The floor lurches, tips again and everything falls. In the darkness after the collapse there are many voices: sobs, sustained screaming, calls for help and water, moans of pain, prayers, howls of grief. Some are trapped in total darkness, others can make out some light. Many are pinned down by huge blocks of concrete, bent iron girders, machinery. Others are entombed in small cavities. Some are alone, others with colleagues or strangers from other floors. Shapla can move her hand but nothing else. Mahmuda can see the sky through a gap in the wall several yards away. Runarini and Preity are trapped together and they can hear voices, but not Shamapati&apos;s. They shout her name, but there is no response. Outside there is chaos. Dazed survivors stand immobile in a huge, roiling cloud of dust. It takes time for Dhaka&apos;s ramshackle emergency services to arrive, so hundreds of locals clamber over and through the rubble, tearing at the concrete blocks and mangled metal with their hands. Soon corpses are lined up on the ground, limbs limp and twisted, as if they had fallen from a\u00a0great height. Mahmuda crawls towards the light, finds herself only a few metres from the ground and clambers down. She cannot see her husband. Shapla waits longer for rescue. She can hear sirens and shouts outside. They are hammering and drilling the slab of concrete above her. She finds her throat so dry from screaming that she cannot talk when the rescuers find her. She is unaware that she has made any noise whatsoever. It takes two hours to free her. Runarini and Preity crawl together towards a\u00a0shaft of light and are lifted from the rubble by mid-afternoon. The ruined building is now surrounded by police and soldiers, and heavy lifting equipment is arriving. There are electric saws and jackhammers, and lines of ambulances. There is no sign of Shamapati. Bangladesh is the original &quot;basket case&quot;, a term coined by Henry Kissinger, the US secretary of state, to describe the country immediately after its violent secession from Pakistan in 1971. Up to 3\u00a0million died in that conflict, a civil war that was simultaneously a war of independence, and its wounds remain livid. Famine, flood, a massive programme of nationalisation, political instability and further violence crippled the new nation&apos;s economy. But, despite the continual challenges, the textiles and garment industry prospered. Investment and advice from Korean companies helped and, by the end of the 1990s, the industry had somehow weathered destructive storms \u2013 political, economic and meteorological. In 2004, when the protectionist quotas that had been imposed to protect western jobs 30 years earlier expired, many in Bangladesh were apprehensive. But the industry boomed. &quot;Business just took off,&quot; says Rubana Huq, now managing director of garment manufacturers the Mohammadi Group. In 2004 there were 2 million workers in Bangladesh&apos;s 4,000 factories, with exports worth $6bn. Nine years later, there were twice as many in 5,600 registered establishments, sending $21bn worth of clothes overseas. Competition from abroad when the quotas disappeared meant &quot;prices dipped&quot;, Huq says, but the demand from Europe and the US was so great that she and others &quot;just kept on building&quot;. If wages in Bangladesh remained the lowest in the world, land prices in central Dhaka, where most of\u00a0the garment businesses were based, rose so fast that new investors sought space on the margins of\u00a0the city where hastily reclaimed wetlands could still be bought relatively cheaply. In Savar, Gazipur, Ashulia and elsewhere around Dhaka, hundreds of factories went up every year. There was little or no planning or regulation. &quot;People were not much concerned by building codes or quality of material,&quot; admits Emdadul Islam, the long-serving chief engineer of Rajuk, Dhaka&apos;s development authority. Monitoring of environmental impact, construction quality and permits for the millions flowing in from rural areas were almost nonexistent. Inevitably, people started to die. In April 2005, a factory in Savar called Spectrum collapsed, killing 64 workers. The dead were making clothes for western retailers. Poor cement was a likely cause \u2013 builders often charge for better-quality materials than they deliver \u2013 or water from a nearby canal may have washed out foundations. For a short period there was talk of a crackdown on unsafe buildings, but even though a second factory in northern Dhaka collapsed a year later, killing 21, the fuss faded. As the recession hit western economies in 2008 and 2009, brands forced down prices even further as they negotiated with suppliers. Those in Bangladesh who demanded government intervention in one of the country&apos;s few economic success stories made little headway when dozens of garment factory owners sat in parliament and powerful industry bodies had the ear of policymakers. The\u00a0boom continued. Bangladesh, the world&apos;s 76th biggest exporter of clothes in 1980, was the eighth biggest in 2006, and by 2013 was second only to China. Over the decade, prompted by a string of reports of child labour and other abuses in factories around the world, the brands had set up systems to monitor pay and working conditions in their supply chain. Some organised their own inspections, many brought in contractors. But executives did not think to undertake structural surveys of the buildings where their clothes were made. Instead,\u00a0they relied on the corrupt, poorly paid, underqualified, undermanned local authorities. This, senior executives at major European brands now admit, was a mistake. Others use stronger terms. From 2005 to March 2013, fires killed an estimated 600, but no more buildings collapsed. The Dhaka suburb of Gulshan is only 15 miles from Savar. Rickshaws negotiate its quiet, tree-lined streets with relative ease and there are many good restaurants. In the late morning, coffee shops are busy with staff from international NGOs and the UN. This is where the Bangladesh operations of many big European and US brands are based, as are the larger buyers who often act as their intermediaries locally.     Fifteen-year-old Preity and her mother managed to escape from the building; her 18-year-old sister Shamapati didn\u2019t make it out. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    The offices of H&amp;M occupy a new five-storey block. There is nothing to distinguish the building, inside or out, from its counterparts in\u00a0any western capital. On the walls of brightly\u00a0lit\u00a0meeting rooms \u2013 each named after garment manufacturing zones around the city \u2013 are posters of laughing, thin, beautiful young Europeans of varying ethnic backgrounds wearing the bright, cheery, fashionable clothes of\u00a0the company&apos;s brands. A\u00a0notice tells staff: &quot;Your passionate focus towards quality will make it happen.&quot; H&amp;M, which has 3,000 stores in around 50 markets worldwide and sales of \u00a313bn in 2012 (making a profit of \u00a31.6bn), has been in Bangladesh since the early 80s and is one of the biggest foreign brands working in the country. The\u00a0Swedish retailer did not have any contracts with the factories working in Rana Plaza, nor any link to the building, and has long been at the forefront of efforts to find a way to improve pay and working conditions in the industry. These have intensified since last April&apos;s tragedy, but &quot;there&apos;s a lot more to the country for us than low wages and low costs&quot;, says Anna Gedda, the company&apos;s social sustainability manager. Executives from other big brands all make similar points when talking about the Rana Plaza collapse, even if their companies have been less proactive than H&amp;M. They express their shock and grief, say they have long recognised the problems in Bangladesh, point out that the chaotic environment of a developing world city means many issues are partly beyond their control (though, they admit, still their responsibility), and downplay the significance of cheap labour in the decision to locate production in the country. They also emphasise the importance of the garment industry to the Bangladeshi economy and the social transformation brought about by the employment of millions of young, rural women, albeit in poorly paid, monotonous jobs. One company spokesman points out that otherwise &quot;these women would be in the fields, in ship-breaking or shrimp farming, working as maids&quot;. Now, he says, they are breadwinners, independent, and often with the means to pay for\u00a0their kids to go to school. H&amp;M&apos;s Gedda says: &quot;The best way for the country is for brands like H&amp;M to stay there.&quot; This is something one hears frequently: from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, senior ministers, international trade unionists, independent economists and urban development specialists in Dhaka. It&apos;s also what all the workers say. Everyone agrees that the Rana Plaza collapse was a &quot;wake-up call&quot; that will be &quot;a turning point&quot;, but they all say the industry and the brands must remain. &quot;If there is a pull-out, it will be a catastrophe for Dhaka,&quot; says Professor Nazrul Islam, of the local Centre for Urban Studies. The result, after a series of fairly acrimonious meetings in Geneva and Paris last year, is three separate initiatives: the Accord, which involves more than 150 largely European brands; the Alliance, set up by US brands; and a joint effort by the UN and the Bangladeshi government. Between them, these three are meant to bring all the factories in Bangladesh into a system of auditing and inspection that will enforce agreed standards. They will also, theoretically, ensure structural surveys. The brands will help pay for improvements needed by their suppliers to meet the new standards \u2013 through grants in the case of\u00a0the legally binding Accord and soft loans for the less constraining Alliance \u2013 and there are also provisions for strengthening the country&apos;s underdeveloped and highly politicised unions. There is a separate process designed to establish how much compensation will be paid \u2013 the total could be more than $40m \u2013 to the Rana Plaza victims. Many brands have refused to become involved and international trade unionists admit the current initiatives have many flaws. Nonetheless, they say, taken together the package\u00a0represents &quot;an unprecedented chance to\u00a0put all this right&quot;. Some specialists even hope that initiatives will\u00a0provide a model not just in Bangladesh but in\u00a0Cambodia, Indonesia, Latin America and even the emerging new markets for production such as\u00a0Burma and Ethiopia. The risk, of course, is that\u00a0attention will fade, as it did after the 2005 Spectrum factory collapse. &quot;This is Plan B,&quot; says\u00a0Srinivas Reddy, the Bangladesh country director of the International Labour Organisation. Plan A led to Rana Plaza. There is no Plan C. If, from afar, the world of the garment workers and the garment industry in Bangladesh is one of\u00a0stark contrasts, up close it is one of shadows and ambiguity. Mohammadpur, for example, is a\u00a0designated slum that is also a booming new neighbourhood on the\u00a0western margins of a city that has no legal boundaries. A few decades ago it\u00a0was wetland like Savar or Gazipur. By the 90s, the marshes had been replaced by rows of wooden sheds on stilts full of\u00a0half-starved labourers and their families. Now it is changing again as Dhaka, a city of at least 15\u00a0million, gets steadily less poor. The wooden shacks have been replaced by cement apartments and rooms. There are tea stalls with TVs tuned to the Discovery Channel, schools, shops and a refurbished mosque. &quot;It&apos;s better than where I came from\u2026 At least there&apos;s a\u00a0chance of making a living here, of a better life, perhaps,&quot; says Salahuddin, a 27-year-old labourer who fled poverty, debt and failing yields on a tiny parcel of land to bring his family to the city. But if it is possible to see incremental and uneven progress in Dhaka, there is also misery, overcrowding, disease, crime and failing infrastructure. Police rarely venture into Mohammadpur. A fire in a garment factory here killed seven in 2013 and fear of such accidents is one reason Salahuddin&apos;s wife, Juleika, prefers poorly paid work as a maid. The dirt roads are strewn with rubbish. Water from standpipes is sold at extortionate prices by landlords in league with local politicians and bureaucrats. There is the perpetual risk of eviction and demolition. In the brutal summer heat, the concrete boxes where entire families live are furnaces. Then there is Bangladesh. It is one of the &quot;Next 11&quot; nations seen by Goldman Sachs as having the potential to take off as major economies. Its development indicators have risen steadily, to the\u00a0point where most are now better than those in neighbouring India. But again, if the rate of population growth has dropped in recent years, it is still high. Flooding and extreme weather events linked to climate change threaten disasters in the future in this low-lying land. The flow from the countryside to the cities is unlikely to slow soon, and, as the effluent from the factories contaminates the once pristine waterways, so toxic politics and endemic graft poison public life.     Of 20 women Shapla supervised in the building, 19\u00a0died.  Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    And what of the garment industry&apos;s role in all of this? Along with remittances from workers overseas, the industry is the only major foreign currency earner for the country. Wages for workers have risen since the disaster \u2013 the minimum monthly salary for an entry-level worker is now 5,300BDT (about \u00a340) a month \u2013 but so have rents, and no one can pretend a family can live on a single salary. Factory conditions might have improved in the last decade, but even without the 1,130 who died in Rana Plaza, the toll from fires and other accidents would be intolerable. Along with the 4\u00a0million directly employed by the industry, economists say there are another 4\u00a0million people whose livelihoods depend on the\u00a0internal demand it generates. If half of these 8\u00a0million people support a family of five, then around a sixth of the population depends on people several thousands miles away buying cheap clothes that they don&apos;t need. And that means this world of ambiguity is one the consumer inhabits, too. Many debate where the blame lies for tragedies such as Rana Plaza, and argue over who has the responsibility to prevent them in the future. The owners of the factories? Those who let the buildings that house the workshops? The crooked builders? The bent bureaucrats? The government? The intermediaries who do so much of the buying? The brands? Some western brands implicitly accept a degree of moral responsibility, even if their lawyers are careful to make sure their legal liability is strictly limited. &quot;People portray companies as evil by definition, and in many aspects they are. But often times a\u00a0company is forced to behave in certain ways by consumer behaviour. If no one buys your product, you are out of business. Consumers take decisions for companies, but often [they] don&apos;t, which means they don&apos;t care,&quot; says one senior executive at a big European high street brand. Though there is little statistical evidence of any\u00a0direct correlation between bad publicity about social issues and sales \u2013 it would, experts say, be almost impossible to establish such a link anyway \u2013 big companies do their own research to\u00a0understand the impact on sales of events such\u00a0as the Rana Plaza collapse. &quot;Companies do very precise work on this to\u00a0understand the consumers and what level of\u00a0quality they are willing to pay for, and [it shows that]\u00a0a large number of consumers prefer inexpensive over respect for human rights or environment,&quot; the executive says. &quot;After all, if you buy a pair of jeans at $9.99, what are you really expecting about the working conditions of\u00a0those who made them or even just the environment in which they live?&quot; Mahmuda eventually found her husband&apos;s body, intact but for a broken nose, laid out in the makeshift morgue set up in the grounds of a local school. It took some days for her to realise that her husband was not going to walk through the door of their small home in Savar. She returned to\u00a0her village to bury him, but life was as hard there as it had ever been and she was soon back in\u00a0Savar. Eight months later, Mahmuda started work at another garment factory, less than 300m from where the Rana Plaza complex stood. She passes the site of the collapse \u2013 the rubble scraped away, a trough of filthy water, scattered bolts of filthy cloth, a stench of decayed matter \u2013 every day. &quot;I\u00a0tell myself if one building has collapsed, it\u00a0doesn&apos;t mean they all will,&quot; she says. &quot;I can&apos;t be\u00a0scared. If I am scared, how will I\u00a0feed my family? I\u00a0tell myself if one building has collapsed, it doesn&apos;t mean they all will.&quot; Runarini, however, has still not fully understood that her daughter will not come home. Shamapati&apos;s remains have never been found. It is possible that the 18-year-old&apos;s corpse may have been buried with 250 others, all unidentified, in the chaotic aftermath of the collapse. There is even a chance that, unrecognisable and untested, it may have been given to the wrong family. Bangladesh&apos;s only DNA testing facility was unable to cope with so many dead, and officials admit mistakes were made. Preity still dreams of her village and misses her friends and school. Now she hopes to set up a\u00a0tailoring shop when she is older, with help from an NGO. &quot;My mum cries all the time,&quot; she says. She misses her sister, too, and Shonjit, who sometimes walked her back from the factory. He\u00a0was killed, too. When Shonjit&apos;s father, Satyadip, who still works as a loader in a nearby factory, heard of the collapse, he ran to the site. &quot;I was crazy. I tried to tear away the stones with my hands. For 13 days I\u00a0went there, round all the hospitals, to find him, to find my son. I held on to my hope, but then we found him and he was not with us any more.&quot; Rubana Huq, managing director of the Mohammadi Group, travelled to the site of the collapse when she heard what had happened, though she has no link to the factories there. She\u00a0set up a small relief operation and spent days handing out water and food to rescue workers. &quot;It\u00a0made me think differently about the workers; that it is another life, like mine,&quot; she says. Shapla has seen only one of the 20 girls she watched over since the day of the tragedy. She saw her, fleetingly, at a\u00a0bus stop. She has heard news of a second. The rest she believes are dead. Now, when she sees their children, she feels &quot;like a criminal&quot;. &quot;I was the one who got them to go in. I was the one they followed. I think about it all the time.&quot; Shapla has found a job at another factory but, due to her back injuries, as a sewing-machine operator, not a supervisor. She would prefer to do &quot;any other job&quot;, but the only alternative is manual labour on construction sites, building new factories and homes for workers, and she needs 10,000BDT (\u00a375) to get her son into a local school. Most of the victims have received money \u2013 some from the government, some from industry bodies, some from one or two brands, such as Primark, that have unilaterally decided to make\u00a0payments while most other brands, the government, global unions and industry bodies argue over the level of compensation they will eventually pay out. Every evening, Mahmuda, Satyadip, Shapla and approximately 4 million others in and around Dhaka stop work, exchange a few words with their colleagues and head home. They go out on to the broken, crowded streets, a stream of workers that flows together, then divides again round the stalls, the beggars, the lines of overloaded trucks, the packed buses immobile amid the rickshaws. They are joined by streams from other factories, flowing together before splitting again into smaller streams down the narrow lanes between the tenements, until these, too, eventually divide and divide once more, and it becomes dark, and the workers are home. \u2022 We Are What We Wear: Unravelling Fast Fashion And The Collapse Of Rana Plaza by Lucy Siegle and Jason Burke is published by Guardian Shorts (ebook, \u00a31.99/$2.99).

As a trade official working under Jang Song-thaek, the recently executed uncle of the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, Son was part of the Pyongyang elite. Those few days of interaction with foreign visitors gave him a vicarious peek at life beyond the confines of the world\u2019s most oppressive dictatorship, and sparked his eventual defection.  But now, 12 years after he arrived in South Korea, Son has a new purpose in life: to return to the North to protest against the treatment of defectors south of the heavily armed border that has separated the two Koreas for more than six decades. \u201cThe South Korean media portray us as people who want to be seen as a victimised minority with a sense of entitlement,\u201d Son told the Guardian in a recent interview in Seoul. \u201cThe government here won\u2019t accept how difficult it is for defectors to adapt to life in a free-market economy, and for that we are treated with contempt. By going public with my desire to defect again [to North Korea] I hope to send a message about how badly South Korea treats defectors.\u201d Son is one of a growing number of double defectors \u2013 political and economic refugees from the North for whom life in the democratic, capitalist South has fallen far short of expectations. If he gets his way, the very least Son can expect is a fleeting moment of fame in North Korea, where every defection back to the communist state is treated as a propaganda coup against the South. Yet he knows he also faces harassment, incarceration or worse. The catalyst for Son\u2019s flight from North Korea was the abrupt end to Moscow\u2019s largesse towards its communist allies after the fall of the Soviet Union. To earn hard currency, the Pyongyang regime turned to illicit arms exports, which Son helped arrange.  However, when he was accused of stealing $10,000 (\u00a35,960) intended to facilitate a sale, potentially worth $30m, of missile-making materials to Taiwan, he believed he had been set-up. He felt he was a marked man. \u201cI knew what the consequences would be,\u201d said Son, who was detained for three months. \u201cI was up against people at the top of the regime, so I took my friends\u2019 advice and got out.\u201d     Son Jong-hun wants to return to North Korea to protest against South Korea's treatment of his fellow refugees. Photograph: Justin McCurry    In April 1997 he hired a truck, telling unsuspecting colleagues that he was going to the countryside on business. Instead he drove across the border with China, leaving behind his wife and their son. A year later his son joined him in Beijing, and together they arrived in Seoul in 2002. Son spent his first year of freedom performing menial jobs. \u201cI got to experience how people on the bottom rung of South Korean society really live,\u201d he said. \u201cI soon discovered that life here was very different from what I\u2019d heard about in the North. The government here seemed to be saying to us, \u2018Well, we didn\u2019t ask you to come so what do you expect?\u2019\u201d Those early days lay the foundations for Son\u2019s work over the past 10 years, helping fellow defectors while plotting his return to a country he still claims to detest. Son, though, is in a minority among defectors. Most savour the political and economic freedoms they daren\u2019t have dreamed about while living in the North. Since the end of the Korean war, about 25,000 North Koreans \u2013 more than two-thirds of them women \u2013 have made the journey across the country\u2019s border with China, where they lie low and earn money to finance the last stage of their journey to South Korea, typically via Thailand or Laos. But tightened security on the North Korea-China border and less sympathetic treatment by recent conservative governments in Seoul have stemmed the flow. According to South Korea\u2019s unification ministry, the number of defectors arriving in Seoul in 2012 fell to 1,509, more than 40% down on the 2,706 who arrived a year earlier. About 1,500 more arrived last year, the ministry said. New arrivals are interrogated to weed out spies, then spend three months at Hanawon, a re-settlement facility an hour south of Seoul where they are given counselling and coached in the practicalities of South Korean life. After completing the Hanawon programme, each defector receives government subsidies of 20m won (\u00a311,200) to find a home or a place at university, followed by monthly payments of 320,000 won for five years. The allowance is barely enough to live on, Son says, since most defectors are indebted to brokers who helped them reach South Korea. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for female defectors to end up in the sex industry or men to get involved in drug dealing [to pay off their trafficking fees],\u201d he said. At around 20%, the unemployment rate among defectors is six times higher than the average for South Koreans, according to the Database Centre for North Korean Human Rights. \u201cIt is harder than you imagine for defectors to find a job,\u201d said Son, who struggled financially despite his background in trade and a degree in business and economics from Pyongyang Industrial University. \u201cThe South Korean government occasionally makes grand gestures, such as employing defectors as officials or letting them run for political office. But it\u2019s all for show in its ideological war with North Korea. They want to prove that they are treating defectors well, when in fact they are doing nothing to improve their lives.\u201d Recent allegations that interrogators sexually abuse newly arrived female defectors have only added to Son\u2019s disenchantment with his home of more than a decade. \u201cLife is hard in North Korea, but some defectors have found that it\u2019s even tougher here. They are afraid of the South Korean government and the police. People are lining up to go home.\u201d     More than a million people gather on Kim Il-sung square in Pyongyang in 2003. Photograph: XInhua/EPA    It is impossible to tell how many defectors have returned to the North. The unification ministry says it has records of only 13 double-defectors, three of whom ended up returning to South Korea. Anecdotal evidence suggests the number is far higher. The South Korean JoongAng Ilbo newspaper quoted a former MP as saying that about 100 people had fled to the North via China in 2012 \u2013 a figure dismissed by the unification ministry \u2013 while about 800 defectors known to have arrived in South Korea are unaccounted for. Son says he knows of 70 to 80 North Koreans who are \u201cdesperate\u201d to go home. While the numbers are disputed, North Korea watchers say there are definite signs the country has launched campaign under Kim Jong-un to woo defectors back home, reportedly with offers of cash, a job and a home. Security agents have been visiting the families of defectors and telling them that it is safe for their loved ones to return, a Reuters investigation found last year. There are unconfirmed reports of agents who have infiltrated South Korea, offering defectors up to $45,000 and an appearance on TV. Over the past year, Pyongyang has staged at least half a dozen media appearances by double defectors, although all appeared to have been meticulously choreographed, with returnees publicly pledging loyalty to Kim and criticising the grim realities of life in the capitalist south. Son\u2019s insistence on leaving South Korea legally has failed to impress the authorities, which invoked the controversial national security law to impose a travel ban. He believes intelligence officials are tapping his phone and occasionally follow him. \u201cIf I don\u2019t do everything by the book, what hope is there for the other defectors I know who want to go back to North Korea?\u201d he said. He is aware that life back in North Korea will probably be far worse than the trials he has experienced as an outsider in Seoul. His brother was executed by firing squad as punishment for being related to a defector; his uncle, once a senior security official in Pyongyang, and his brother-in-law, a former army colonel, were stripped of their military titles and given ordinary civilian jobs. Son and his wife divorced before he left the North so that she would escape punishment.  At the end of a two-hour interview, Son reveals he is suffering from cirrhosis of the liver and has been given between one and three years to live. Before he dies, he wants to be reunited with his ageing mother, who he is convinced is still alive. But he insists his motivation for returning to North Korea is political. \u201cI want the world to know how callously the South Korean government treats its Korean brothers and sisters,\u201d he said. \u201cThe North Korean regime might well use me for propaganda, or I might end up in prison. After all, I didn\u2019t flee because I was hungry. I left for political reasons. \u201cBut I\u2019m ready to sacrifice my freedom in the hope that North Koreans here can one day have theirs.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/22/strike-spreads-chinese-supplier-adidas-nike-yeu-yuen-factory-jiangxi-guangdong", "publicationDate": "2014-04-22T11:12:45Z", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["Do we get the social insurance that we&apos;re legally entitled to?&quot; The Dongguan complex, which is operated by the Taiwan-based Pou Chen Group, has at least 40,000 employees and produces footwear for Reebok, Nike, and more than 20 other brands."], "title": "Strike spreads at Chinese supplier to Adidas and Nike", "article": "A strike at a Chinese factory that manufactures shoes for Adidas and Nike has spread to a sister factory in a neighbouring province, as thousands of workers gathered to protest against what they said were unfair pay and benefits. About 2,000 workers clocked in on Monday, but did not work, at the Yue Yuen factory complex in Jiangxi province, southern China, joining at least 10,000 employees at another Yue Yuen factory complex in Dongguan, Guangdong province, who have been on strike since 14 April. Up to 30,000 employees have stopped working in the strike \u2013 China&apos;s largest in recent memory, according to the New York-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) China Labour Watch. &quot;The issue that [the workers] are concerned about is very widespread,&quot; said Geoff Crothall of the Hong Kong-based China Labour Bulletin, another NGO. &quot;In this case, at least the company was paying something, it just wasn&apos;t the full amount.

According to the China Labour Bulletin four workers were taken to hospital on the first day of the strike. Chinese state media has claimed that no one was injured. &quot;We&apos;re continuing the strike,&quot; a worker in Dongguan surnamed Zhou told Reuters on Monday. &quot;We swiped our cards and then went back [home]. The other production lines in the same network are striking too.&quot; Images online show massive crowds gathered in front of an eight-storey building, many apparently taking pictures with their mobile phones. In one, protesters carry a large banner, which reads: &quot;Give me back my social insurance, give me back my housing benefits!&quot; Yue Yuen&apos;s spokesman, George Liu, told Chinese media that the firm had offered to raise workers&apos; living allowance at its southern Chinese factories by 230 yuan (\u00a322) a month, beginning on 1 May. It also promised to introduce a social security benefit plan next month. On Tuesday, Yue Yuen&apos;s management could not be reached for comment. One worker, Xiang Feng, 28, said at least 80% of the workers were likely to refuse the offer. &quot;Workers may end up with a take-home salary almost unchanged or maybe even lower than before,&quot; she told Bloomberg. The government of Guobao, the city in which the factory complex in Jiangxi province is located, has urged Yue Yuen to assuage the workers&apos; concerns without bending the law. &quot;Company and worker representatives are urged to strengthen communication and consultation ... and guide the rational expression of the aspirations of the workers,&quot; it said on Monday.

What&apos;s he been doing today? &quot;I can&apos;t tell you!&quot; Why? &quot;I don&apos;t remember! But it was good. It was good for her. It was good for me. The usual stuff.&quot; In Doyle terms, this is indeed the usual stuff. Throughout our one-hour Skype session he rants, raves, laughs (a lot, uproariously, mostly at his own jokes), gets angry, gets upset, and it&apos;s never entirely clear whether he&apos;s speaking on or off the record. A gloriously unbridled and candid interviewee, he can&apos;t get his words out fast enough. He says he became a cinematographer by accident. Born in Sydney, 1952, he says he was &quot;conceived in the back of a station wagon on Bondai beach,&quot; but who knows? At 18, he joined the merchant navy then country-hopped for years, studied Chinese in Taiwan, did some oil-drilling, cow-herding and photography, then in 1983 was asked to work on Edward Yang&apos;s That Day, on the Beach. Awards followed and he&apos;s been a cinematographer since, hurtling through more than 60 films. He is most notable for his collaborations with Wong Kar-wai, although he&apos;s also worked with Gus Van Sant, M Night Shyamalan, Jim Jarmusch and Jon Favreau, being called upon to make their films look beautiful, which he does, every time. His gift can be seen in the Chilean director Sebasti\u00e1n Silva&apos;s disturbing psychological horror, Magic Magic, filmed in 2012. &quot;I&apos;m so fucking proud of the way the lake looks, and the menace of water,&quot; he says of his work on the film, which finds a fragile young woman (Juno Temple) mentally unravelling in the Chilean countryside.  Did Doyle enjoy it out there? &quot;What do you mean? It&apos;s fucking countryside, there&apos;s no Chinese restaurants, no Chinese women \u2013 oh, there were Chinese women, I imported them, I forgot. I don&apos;t know, it&apos;s really weird, I hate countryside, but then fucking hell, every time it just takes me somewhere. Because I guess I&apos;m not used to it. I love noise, I live on the first floor above Hollywood Road in Hong Kong, there&apos;s not a minute when there aren&apos;t sirens, I just love the noise and the energy of a city.&quot; Had he read the script? Doyle&apos;s known for not wasting his time on such matters. &quot;Not very much! I skip through them. And you get an idea of it. I&apos;d rather look at the locations, that&apos;s more valid to me, the sense of space and the climate.&quot; He prizes on-set chemistry above all else, singling out Temple as &quot;the greatest pleasure&quot; of his Magic Magic experience. &quot;She&apos;s such a great actor \u2026 the lack of bullshit is so beautiful.&quot; His relationship with Silva was more complex. The director told me he learned a lot from Doyle, considers him a mentor, and speaks well of the collaboration, praising Doyle&apos;s &quot;pictoric take&quot; on the film. But then, he also considered Doyle a nightmare. &quot;I think it was the environment, shooting in the south of Chile in winter, it could get really nasty, the cold. Chris is way more of an urban person, he likes buildings and neon lights and pretty girls, this was really out of his element,&quot; he said, adding that they argued on set. &quot;I&apos;ll never forget all the fun shit we did together. But I called him an asshole in front of people. Because we were friends and we were enemies too. It was a weird sort of Herzog-Kinski relationship.&quot; &quot;So he&apos;s Kinski, ah, I understand,&quot; laughs Doyle. Do Silva&apos;s comments make sense? &quot;Sure, why not? Yeah, it&apos;s tough in the sense of \u2026 &quot; He pauses, then responds emphatically. &quot;We work faster in Hong Kong.&quot; He laughs. &quot;But the give or take of the process is what makes it eclectic or perhaps unexpected. The integrity of the people making the film, the energy of Sebasti\u00e1n is not exactly my energy, not exactly my so-called social and cultural milieu, but I&apos;m there for him.&quot;     Christopher Doyle. Photograph: Larry Busacca/Getty Images    Silva&apos;s not the first director to have locked horns with Doyle. On the set of M Night Shyamalan&apos;s Lady in the Water, he was apparently a whirlwind of mischief, dropping his trousers and pants when studio heads showed up and being generally inappropriate. The film looks lush, though. &quot;I think the great quality of my so-called reputation is that 90% of the shit passes me by,&quot; he says. &quot;Occasionally I still get shit offered to me. I think that people who would have the temerity to work with me know they&apos;re in for a ride, and I&apos;m proud of that. I&apos;m not even a cinematographer, hopefully I&apos;m a collaborator.&quot; Last year he said that Claudio Miranda&apos;s cinematography Oscar for Life of Pi was &quot;a fucking insult to cinematography&quot;, as so many of the film&apos;s images were created digitally by hordes of people.  Various directors get it in the neck from Doyle and, inevitably, Scorsese comes up. Doyle says he has a lot of respect for him, but was pretty irate when the director made The Departed, a remake (of sorts) of Infernal Affairs, for which Doyle was cinematographer. He said Scorsese&apos;s approach was disappointing and depressing, and hollered &quot;Fuck The Departed&quot; on stage in Toronto last year.  &quot;Have you seen fucking The Whore of Wall Street?&quot; he asks. &quot;Marty, you&apos;re such a genius, what the fuck are you doing? It made me so sad, this genius person, and then \u2026&quot; Exhaling deeply, he looks truly depressed, turning away and gazing into the middle distance.  &quot;I don&apos;t know. It just made me sad all the time. What is it telling us? It&apos;s not engaging us in anything important,&quot; he says, ranting at length before I get back to my point, which is that despite his disdain for American remakes, he worked on Gus Van Sant&apos;s Psycho, a shot-by-shot remake of one of the most iconic films of all time. &quot;No, no, no, no, no,&quot; he says, fixing me intently. &quot;No. Gus Van Sant made a $20m artwork. That&apos;s not the same.&quot; What&apos;s the difference? &quot;It&apos;s not a \u2026 who gives a shit about the film? It&apos;s the concept. Who gives a fucking shit about the film? I don&apos;t.&quot; Does Gus Van Sant not give a shit? &quot;Yes, he&apos;s on my side. I was the first one to say it and then he realised it was true. It&apos;s a reinterpretation of a black and white piece of art. Don&apos;t even worry about the film. It&apos;s the concept. It&apos;s fucking Duchamp.&quot; Doyle runs on instinct both on and off the set, and there&apos;s no denying that everything he says and does comes from a genuine place. &quot;Fucking hell, I wish I could be JMW Turner,&quot; he says when discussing his work on Magic Magic. &quot;Wouldn&apos;t it be one day wonderful to be called a JMW Turner of cinematography?&quot; He often is regarded as one of the best in the business, though.  &quot;No, no, I&apos;m the fucking Keith Richards of cinematography, don&apos;t fuck with my reputation!&quot; Another laugh. &quot;Here&apos;s a story. A producer wanted me to do a film, and they called me and said they were with Keith Richards talking about Pirates of the Caribbean. So this producer asked Keith if he&apos;d do the role and Keith said: &apos;Why don&apos;t you call Chris Doyle?&apos;&quot; Does he know Keith Richards? &quot;No,&quot; he laughs. &quot;But he must know me! Could you avoid me? I mean, come on.&quot; Is it a true story? &quot;I don&apos;t know, but it doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s true or not, it&apos;s a good story, right? I think one day when we meet he&apos;ll punch me out and say: &apos;You liar,&apos; and then we&apos;ll snort something and everything will be forgiven.&quot; Before I let him get on with his night, I ask him about a story Wong Kar-wai once told. At 5am on the last day of the Ashes of Time shoot in 1994, the set was being burned down for the final shot. Still drunk from the previous evening&apos;s wrap party, Doyle ran towards the fire, camera in hand, drunk and naked. The director took a photo, and whenever anyone ever asks what Doyle is like, he shows them the photo and says: &quot;This is Chris Doyle.&quot; Is that still Chris Doyle? He pauses, deep in thought for a good 15 seconds, before replying &quot;Yes&quot; and laughing hysterically. &quot;Come on. I&apos;m fucking pissed off that [Charles] Bukowski stopped drinking when he was 76. I&apos;m so fucking pissed off with Bukowski. If you&apos;re gonna be a legend in your own Y-fronts, you better fill your Y-fronts with bottles of beer.&quot; \u2022 Magic Magic is in cinemas and on Virgin Movies now, and out on DVD on 28 April.

However, a recent promo for a bundle of Indie sci-fi games, books and videos raked in more than $5,000. So what&apos;s needed to make these people pay for content?  As Upworthy would say, you won&apos;t believe the answer. (Then again, the statistics are pretty demoralising: 375 customers from over 100,000 visitors. So an average of 5c per visitor; just over $13 per paying customer. Remind us again about how torrent users spend more than &quot;average&quot; consumers.) But the conclusion of &quot;how to make people pay&quot; really is surprising. OTA testing: MIMO standards, costs and the &apos;death grip&apos; &gt;&gt; Mobile and Wireless News US Kelly Hill:   The wireless industry currently has no standard for LTE MIMO testing, due to disagreements among which of four possible approaches should be adopted \u2013 or whether multiple testing methods will be standardized. The panel members agreed that the amount of time that has to be dedicated to OTA testing is the biggest challenge due to time-to-market pressures. OTA testing budgets, according to Pat Connor, director of Qualcommn&apos;s antenna lab, &quot;[require] more planning now. We need to look further in advance to really make our budget for the upcoming year. The complexity has really increased.&quot; The discussion also grappled with the &quot;death grip&quot; issue, or how to test in order to anticipate issues for users who grip their phones too tightly. That kind of grip can cause dropped calls and lead to certain phones being returned in high numbers. However, certification testing doesn&apos;t account for the death grip, which is difficult to standardize for the phantom hands used in testing, because the grip would vary by handset.  Google+ won (or why Google never needed a social network) &gt;&gt; John Battelle&apos;s Search Blog  Think about your relationship to Google five years ago \u2013 you most likely weren&apos;t &quot;logged in,&quot; unless you were using a silo&apos;d service like mail. Now think about it today \u2013 you most likely are. We have Google+ to thank for that. It&apos;s done its job, and it&apos;ll keep doing it, whether or not you ever use its social bells and whistles as a primary social network. Google still has a lot of work to do on identity \u2013 anyone who has more than one login can attest to that. But Google+ has won \u2013 it&apos;s forced the majority of Google users onto a single, signed in state across devices and applications. That protects and extends Google&apos;s core advertising business, and opens up the ability to ladder new services \u2013 like Nest \u2013 into Google&apos;s platform.  A personal reflection on Google+ &gt;&gt; TechCrunch Danny Crichton offers a thoughtful look back on how G+ evolved, having been there when it got started:   I had just gotten my Google-issued laptop, so I opened up my web browser, and navigated to the internal version of the product, and \u2026. stared. Just stared. It&apos;s hard to exactly describe the state of the product at that point, but it was reminiscent of Facebook, albeit with a cleaner profile page and more whitespace. After about 10 minutes of using it, I got distracted and left to find some food. I never reopened the product that day, an ominous sign in retrospect.  How businesses will save the stumbling tablet market &gt;&gt; CITEWorld Matt Rossoff:   I think the PC refresh cycle is relevant in the consumer market, because I think that the main avenue for growth there is consumers replacing worn-out old PCs. Early adopters bought tablets in addition to their PCs, and found an &quot;in between&quot; use for them.\u00a0But that first wave of adoption is over now. For most people, their last PC is good enough. As those PCs wear out, they&apos;ll replace them -- and I still maintain that most of those replacements will be tablets, not new PCs with keyboards. But the consumer PC refresh cycle is five to seven years. Not two to three years. In other words, the consumer tablet market is saturated -- with PCs. The enterprise tablet market is actually where things get much more interesting.   HTC design chief Croyle said to depart smartphone maker &gt;&gt; Bloomberg Tim Culpan:   HTC&apos;s design chief will depart the Taiwanese smartphone maker, the most senior executive to leave since its public relations chief resigned in October, according to two people familiar with the move.

Foxconn sells communications technology patents to Google &gt;&gt; WSJ.com  Foxconn, which assembles gadgets for companies such as Apple said it has sold a number of its communications technology patents to Google for an undisclosed sum. Taiwan-based Foxconn, officially known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, made a name for itself in contract manufacturing by making Apple&apos;s iPhones and Sony&apos;s PlayStation game consoles. But few know the electronics manufacturer has been developing new technologies and has a sizable patent portfolio. In a statement, the company said it has applied for 128,400 patents and has been granted more than 64,300 patents worldwide.  Odd move: Google still has the Motorola patents, and it&apos;s unclear what Foxconn has developed in communications. Lab tested: the Mac Pro daisy chain challenge &gt;&gt; Macworld  A Thunderbolt daisy chain can support six connected peripherals per port. And the Mac Pro has six Thundebolt ports, four more than any other Mac. The Mac Pro also has four USB 3.0 ports, one HDMI port, and two gigabit ethernet ports, so you can connect a lot of devices to one Mac Pro.  Neat experiment. Covert Bitcoin miner found stashed in malicious Google Play apps &gt;&gt; Ars Technica Dan Goodin:   The malware, dubbed &quot;BadLepricon&quot; by its creators, was stowed away inside six separate wallpaper apps that had from 100 to 500 downloads each, according to a blog post published Thursday by researchers from Lookout, an anti-malware provider for smartphones. Google employees promptly removed the offending apps once Lookout reported them. It&apos;s at least the second time in a month that third-party researchers have discovered cryptocurrency-mining apps available for download on Google servers. Four weeks ago, researchers from Trend Micro reported they found two apps downloaded from one million to five million times that mined the Litecoin and Dogecoin cryptocurrencies without explicitly informing end users.

Lately, though, much of the most exciting work in sustainable business has focused on systems change \u2013 sometimes within an industry, sometimes up and down corporate supply chains and sometimes across industries and geographies. Systems-change initiatives like the The Sustainability Consortium, the Sustainable Apparel Coalition and ZHDC, which stands for Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals, differ in their approach and structure, but they are all tackling problems too sprawling and too complicated for even the biggest companies to solve on their own.  The process of changing large-scale systems is a mix of art and science, and its practitioners can be found inside companies, in consulting firms and in academia. The consulting firm BluSkye helped the dairy industry reduce its carbon emissions and was hired by Alcoa to try to give US recycling rates a big boost. Starbucks engaged MIT professor Peter Senge to take a systems-based approach to the challenge of recycling the billions of cups the food service industry uses every year to hold hot liquids. Nonprofit WWF has dived into system-change efforts such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, a standard-setting group that brings together producers, processors, traders, brands, retailers and NGOs. To grow systems change, a group of individuals and organizations formed the Academy for Systemic Change in 2012. Joe Hsueh, one of its founding members, recently sat down with me to talk about systems change, how it works and why it matters. The &quot;why&quot; is simple. &quot;Big, complex problems cannot be solved by any one technological improvement or any one organization acting alone,&quot; Hsueh says. These problems, sometimes called &quot;wicked problems&quot;, typically have numerous causes and no clear solutions. They involve multiple stakeholders and ultimately require lots of people and organizations to shift their mindset and behavior. Examples include threats to marine ecosystems, unsustainable production and consumption practices, climate change, obesity, inadequate health care \u2013 many of the large-scale environmental and social problems confronting mankind. Hsueh, who is 39, has consulted on a variety of systems-change projects. He worked on the ZDHC effort to reduce toxics in apparel and footwear, advised Nike on its effort to green its supply chain, and helped a Mexican fishery better manage its stocks. He is currently advising a World Bank effort in Turkey to build a more resilient society, helping the Sustainable Apparel Coalition co-create its 2020 strategy with its members and just beginning an ambitious effort to develop a cancer-free economy with a collaborative network funded by the Garfield Foundation.  In all of this work, he has drawn knowledge from his formal education \u2014 he has a master&apos;s in economics from Queen&apos;s University in Ontario, a master&apos;s in public administration from Harvard&apos;s Kennedy School and his PhD in systems dynamics from MIT&apos;s Sloan school, where he studied with pioneering thinkers Peter Senge and John Sterman. But he also found wisdom during a year working as a volunteer with the poor at a Buddhist monastery, Tzu Chi, in Taiwan, his native country. &quot;Systems mapping, system modeling \u2013 all these scientific tools and methods \u2013 these are not ends in themselves,&quot; Hsueh says. &quot;For me, they are tools for us to create a space where we open our minds, open our hearts and open our will.&quot; Hsueh sees himself as more of an enabler than an expert. Unlike conventional consultants, who are hired by organizations to solve problems, Hsueh and his colleagues gradually tease out the aspirations and knowledge of people inside systems to drive change from the bottom up, not the top down. They co-create a shared vision of the future, use tools like system maps to form a shared understanding of the system, identify leverage points to drive change, experiment and learn from pilot projects, develop leaders and scale up their successes. It sounds abstract and the complexity can be daunting (see the system map below) but success requires as much human connection as intellectual rigor. Systems mapping is &quot;relationship building at its core&quot;, Hsueh says. When conflicts arise, they can often be worked through if people with seemingly different short-term goals come to see how their interests align over time.      Systems change process maps, such as this one from the Academy for Systemic Change and SecondMuse, can be a useful tool in making systems more sustainable. Image: Joe Hsueh    &quot;A critical question is: How is my success depending on your success?&quot; Hsueh says. &quot;Might there be a deeper shared aspiration that can bring us together?&quot; The Mexican fishermen, for example, had been maximizing their catch and depleting stocks of fish known as corvina off the west coast of Mexico for many years. Worse, as they caught more fish, prices fell and they felt a need to catch even more. They were stuck in a vicious cycle.  Working with the Academy of Systemic Change with funding from the Walton Family Foundation, Hsueh and colleagues worked with a Mexican NGO and with Environmental Defense Fund in 2011 to bring together the fishermen, local buyers, government officials and scientists, a process that led the fisherman to agree to &quot;catch shares,&quot; a way of limiting overfishing used in other fishing communities. Recently, Hsueh joined a consulting firm called SecondMuse, which says it applies &quot;the art and science of collaboration to solve complex problems&quot;. Its clients include Nike (for its Launch project), Intel, NASA and the World Bank. Hsueh might never have become involved in system change were it not for his encounter with the Buddhists. After working as a macro-economist for the Canadian finance ministry and before starting grad school at Harvard, he returned to Taiwan, intending to spend a week at a monastery. On the first day, he was taken to a shantytown and told to help a poor and sick old man who had been left along by his family. Hsueh chatted with the man, cleaned his house and eventually gave him a bath, his first one in weeks. &quot;His tears came out and my tears came out, too,&quot; Hsueh recalled. &quot;He was laughing and crying, laughing and crying like a baby. He felt loved and I felt it, too. I was so happy that day.&quot; He realized that something was missing from his work life: &quot;That direct human touch.&quot; He volunteered with the nuns for a year. That human touch is key to unlocking systems change, Hsueh says: &quot;We are all fundamentally the same, as human beings. We all want love and happiness. We all have the capacity to be compassionate,&quot; Hsueh says.  Systems change, when it works, brings out the kindness and compassion in people so they can create a better world together. It is so important, so hard - and yet so simple."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/may/01/bury-art-museum-tour-china-turner", "publicationDate": "2014-05-01T15:20:00Z", "tags": ["Culture professionals network", "Audiences", "Finance", "Logistics", "Art and design", "Culture", "Art", "Sculpture", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Museums"], "sentences": ["Five projects are currently under consideration: Japan and Taiwan are in talks and there have been exploratory meetings in the Gulf about working with Emirates museums.", "Other local authorities have indeed taken their cue from their neighbours, with Bolton Museums, for example, taking its Egyptology collection to Taiwan and China."], "title": "Art on tour: how renting out Turner turned around Bury's fortunes", "article": "A tourist from Bury on a holiday in China last year might have been startled to see some familiar exhibits in the Beijing World Art Museum. JMW Turner&apos;s Calais Sands and some 80 other works from Bury, Bolton and various northern towns toured six of the country&apos;s cities for a year from November 2012. The exhibition, Toward Modernity, also featured works by Constable, Lowry, Moore and Freud and was seen by more than 3 million people. Foreign touring exhibitions are nothing new but up to now they have been in the hands of big national institutions such as the Tate, the British Museum or V&amp;A. Toward Modernity was the first time that a regional museum had broken into the foreign market. The scheme was the brainchild of Bury Art Museum&apos;s manager, Tony Trehy, who saw the potential of the foreign tour as he contemplated an era of constant cuts. The town&apos;s vast art collection, which includes many works by Victorian masters donated to the city, seemed to provide the answer. Trehy says that in a way, it was easier to think the unthinkable following the authority&apos;s expulsion from the Museums Association when councillors sold an LS Lowry painting to cover a budget shortfall in 2005. &quot;Up to then we had been a flagship museum \u2013 a model of good practice in family friendly policies, in international links and so on. All of a sudden we had pariah status.&quot; A planned collaboration with the British Museum was cancelled so Bury looked for other partnerships abroad. The museum had already built international links with German and Scandinavian artists through its pioneering Irwell Sculptural Trail and used those to have a show in Iceland. &quot;The European model is different. If they take a show, they pay for it, in some cases as much as \u00a3150,000,&quot; says Trehy. &quot;In the UK, touring shows are provided to other people for free.&quot; Trehy persuaded councillors to allow the council&apos;s art treasures to go on tour, so that in his words, &quot;we could curate our way out of trouble&quot;. The plan was to replace conventional subsidy with earned income. The tour idea took off with help from both Arts Council England and the British Council. The collection of 80 works, many from other galleries in Lancashire, went on its six venue 12-month tour in November 2012.  Trehy is a little coy, however, about revealing exactly how much the tour was worth to Bury: &quot;Put it this way, it&apos;s sufficiently lucrative that people have stopped talking about cutting us.&quot; Certainly it was worthwhile enough for Trehy and his small team to be planning further ventures. Five projects are currently under consideration: Japan and Taiwan are in talks and there have been exploratory meetings in the Gulf about working with Emirates museums. &quot;We can&apos;t do it all on our own,&quot; he says. &quot;So much of what we are involved in is talking to other galleries about how they might work like this.&quot; &quot;Assuming we can do it on a regular basis, it becomes a significant new source of funding for museums&quot; he says. Other local authorities have indeed taken their cue from their neighbours, with Bolton Museums, for example, taking its Egyptology collection to Taiwan and China. The idea of taking a picture on tour is that &quot;rather than sell it, we can essentially rent it&quot;, says Trehy, who is himself critical of the decision to sell the Lowry. &quot;We demonstrated that we could trade a local service. We have created a new model for the collection and it leaves us, the curators, controlling the agenda.&quot; But it&apos;s not just about commerce; many of these works had been in storage, unseen. Taking art to the Far East is just one of Trehy&apos;s plans to expand the boundaries of conventional art gallery practice. He&apos;s also turning the city&apos;s main library into an international sculpture centre, showing works from emerging artists from Europe and beyond. &quot;I take the view that people from here shouldn&apos;t have to go to Berlin or Barcelona or even London to see the latest art,&quot; he says. The sculpture centre will perfectly complement the existing sculpture trail and the first show has already attracted international names. Trehy hopes that Bury, which is just over half an hour from Manchester by train, will become part of a sculpture network with that major city, along the lines of the Yorkshire Sculpture Triangle, which links Wakefield and Leeds.  &quot;I want it to put Bury on the map, certainly, and get people from outside coming here, but 50% of the work will be local \u2013 it will be Bury&apos;s sculpture; their place too,&quot; says Trehy. &quot;I will not make any apologies for that.&quot; This is an edited version of an article first published in Arts Industry magazine Join our community of arts, culture and creative professionals by signing up free to the Guardian Culture Pros Network."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/02/wiltons-london-sw1-restaurant-review", "publicationDate": "2014-05-02T20:00:00Z", "tags": ["Restaurants", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "London holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "Europe holidays", "Travel"], "sentences": ["He probably owns Taiwan."], "title": "Wiltons, London SW1 \u2013 restaurant review | Marina O'Loughlin", "article": "A woman swoops past in a snood.

An ancient Japanese man is\u00a0slumped over the bar, picking desultorily at a lobster. He probably owns Taiwan. The staff jolly him: &quot;Better than anything at Tsukiji, huh?&quot; &quot;No it isn&apos;t,&quot; he growls. Wiltons is Another World. I&apos;ve been drawn here by news that they&apos;ve updated the decor, which, to its clientele, is as shocking as Bobby Trendy being drafted in to tart up Mount Rushmore. For this place is The Establishment writ so large, it&apos;s blinding. Stoic in the face of world wars and recessions, always based around St James&apos;s, Wiltons has continued to serve without a stutter since it launched as a restaurant in the 1840s (it had been an oyster stall since 1742), nothing interrupting its chorus of cheery, deferential &quot;good mornings&quot;. The changes are, well, subtle. To\u00a0me, it all looks pretty much the same as when I last came here about 10 years ago. Back then, the place&apos;s almost exclusively male stuffiness made me feel like a naughty schoolgirl, a stereotype I imagine the designers of the female staff&apos;s uniforms discarded before deciding on an outfit that says &quot;nanny with medical skills&quot; in shades of Germolene and Pepto-Bismol. The food is that over-used phrase, the best of British. It really is. (Apart, perhaps, from the most beautiful, lacquered smoked Norwegian salmon from Hansen &amp; Lydersen.) Stickily braised short-rib from Rhug Estate. Oysters straight from the old briny: creamy, almost hazelnutty little Jerseys; fat, meaty Colchesters. The prawns in their cocktail (oh yes) are just-landed fresh, as sweet and tender as langoustines, and come in cream-laced marie rose, poster sauce for retro luxury, plus there&apos;s an extra boat of the stuff to ladle on should madam so wish. That salmon has a\u00a0salad of such spring-like delicacy \u2013 tiny shoots and leaves and buds of\u00a0peas \u2013 it almost sparkles. I have lobster and caviar omelette (swoon), swollen with seafood, lounging in a pool of invigorating bisque, its surface so impossibly smooth, it looks airbrushed. The pal has a monkfish dish that&apos;s almost daringly contemporary: crisp on top and served on a bed of sea beet, cockles and bacon. &quot;You&apos;d like truffle mash with that, madam?&quot; Oh, god, yes, we would. I&apos;ve no idea who the chef is. Easy to find out, I suppose, but that&apos;s not the point. Wiltons is above all that sort of cheffy stuff. It&apos;s about the customer, about making them feel like the potentates they probably are, about setting up their bloody marys and black velvets as soon as they walk in the room. This time, I\u00a0don&apos;t feel like a naughty schoolgirl, I feel like a leftie mole, waiting to be ejected for my lack of patrician genes and scuffed shoes. I&apos;ve even ignored the &quot;no mobiles&quot; rule and snap away like a right prole. Even the crockery is beautiful. Time may have stood still at Wiltons, preserved in aspic \u2013 and laced with sauternes, obviously \u2013 but what is emphatically de nos jours is the bill. We choose mostly the cheapest options \u2013 the set lunch, a 44 quid bottle of Torroxal albari\u00f1o from the scaredy-cat&apos;s end of the wine list, only one pudding from the set menu (a cr\u00e8me br\u00fblee as stout and stiff as some of the customers, with peepshow pink rhubarb sorbet and compote), no aperitif, no coffee, no liqueur. Yes, yes, the lobster and caviar omelette: but at \u00a331 it&apos;s way less than the \u00a349 grilled turbot or \u00a346 &quot;seafood salad&quot; starter \u2013 what&apos;s in it, unicorn de mer?

It requires continuous assessments of risk and calculations of intersecting vectors. You have to assess the likelihood that a bus or truck might turn left across your path, which is the one of the most common causes of death for cyclists, and compute the varying speeds of cars, taxis, mobility scooters, motorbikes, rickshaws and fellow bike riders. Among the latter, you judge whether someone is an unstable, first-time Boris-bike user. You assess whether each is a hard-shell or a soft-shell cyclist, a head-down racer carapaced in high-visibility and low wind-resistance, or someone more interested in an amiable amble. You note pedestrians and the chance that they might be tourists who have forgotten about the British travelling on the left and could therefore step off the pavement unannounced. You consider the possibility of doors opening on parked cars. You try to decipher the inscrutable instructions of cycle lanes. In recent years, there has been a palpable change in the balance of power. Cycling has more than doubled in London in 10 years and through sheer weight of numbers bikes oblige cars to take more notice of them, to proceed gingerly, to give more room, to adjust their pace. The uncertain skills of some cyclists are also a factor, as wobblers make drivers more wary. The cumulative effect, on a summer evening&apos;s rush hour, is a swarming of two-wheeled traffic. There is some tension and aggression, as there always is in the competition for road space, but the atmosphere can be almost festive and mildly exhilarating. There is a variety of behaviour too, from fast, long-distance journeys from outer suburbs to the intricate negotiations of different users in small central streets. The London swarms are one symptom of the way that, patchily but distinctively, British cities are growing a new culture of bikes. In Brighton, Bristol, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield, rates increased by between 80% and 109% in the first decade of the century (even though, in less metropolitan areas, rates stood still or fell). This culture is individualistic and entrepreneurial, occupying many niches. It includes cafes that embrace both cycling and some more-or-less well-defined social purpose, esoteric magazines, specialised crafts and industries, festivals, tours, clubs and rallies. Its manifestations include such things as the Dunwich Dynamo, in which hundreds turn up, on the Saturday in July nearest to a full moon, to ride through the night a 120-mile route from east London to the Suffolk coast. There is a society for watching films with bicycle-related themes. There is the still unreal fact that Britain cannot only scoop armfuls of Olympic cycling medals, but also provide two different winners, in successive years, of the Tour de France. This year the race will start in the Yorkshire Dales. Cycling supports manufacturing industry of a kind often thought to have disappeared in Britain. In Brentford, Middlesex, there is a factory reached by a ride under a concrete flyover, scented with diesel and spring flowers, in which 230 skilled people make Bromptons, casting parts, brazing the elements together, smoothing their surfaces with rumbling machines and checking their alignment with measuring devices. The frames then go to Wales to be painted and back again. Then, passed around an informal-looking loop of standing people, the elements become in the space of 38 minutes bikes, each worker adding gears, brakes, wheels and other parts according to an individual specification requested by each purchaser. Brompton&apos;s sales are going up 25% a year; it currently makes 120 a day. It once tried to shift production to Taiwan, but it didn&apos;t work.     The Brompton bicycle factory in west London. Photograph: Luke MacGregor/Reuters    British bike culture runs a social gamut. There is, for example, the Bristol Bike Project, a charity that aims to help disadvantaged people, including refugees, the homeless and recovering substance abusers, by acquiring unwanted bikes: the beneficiaries learn how to recondition them, and then get to keep them, meaning they can acquire new skills and increase their mobility. It is hard to think of a more admirable set of objectives. There is also Rapha, the brand that sells high-performance jerseys for up to \u00a3195, and embrocations and lotions packaged like beauty products. Its stylish website artfully combines nostalgic images of the weatherbeaten faces of old racers with new technology and claims of &quot;superb functionality&quot;. Rapha&apos;s shop in Soho (and it has others in Osaka, Sydney, New York and San Francisco) presents its products like objects in an art gallery, or at least a fashion store. It is not just a place to buy things, but also a club that organises festivals and tours. The shop includes a cafe of calibrated chillness, where you can watch non-stop cycling television over your yimu oolong tea and cardamom bun. Bikes come with calibrations of status, captured by the BBC&apos;s comedy series about itself, W1A, in which the haplessness of Hugh Bonneville&apos;s head of values is signalled by the fact that he can&apos;t fold his Brompton and that his high-visibility jacket is in traffic warden&apos;s yellow-green. The effortless superiority of his nemesis, the director of strategic governance, is apparent in his classier red jacket, the deft flicks with which he manipulates his folding bike and the fact that it is a raw lacquer version of Bonneville&apos;s: it has a clear finish rather than paint, the better to reveal the beauty of its brazed joints. As cars get more like one another, and more boring, bikes are acquiring nuances and variations, of which the ultimate example is the personalised, made-to-measure, handmade frame. Finding this concept mysterious but intriguing \u2013 how much difference can it really make to have a machine&apos;s dimensions exactly tailored to yours? \u2013 I take myself to a light industrial zone in Camberwell, south-east London, the home of Saffron Frameworks. Here, in a small workshop, with tools calmly arrayed on the walls, Matthew Sowter makes frames for prices starting at \u00a31,250 each, plus \u00a3300 for paint, plus further sums for the wheels, pedals, chain, brakes and all the rest. A total cost of more than \u00a310,000 is likely. I am taken into a world of craft, of precise choices of stiffness, of the diameters of tubes and the thickness of steel, of material added or taken away to match the degree of stress, of specially treated stainless steel, invented a few years ago, which overcomes that material&apos;s usual lack of tensile strength. Silver is used in soldering because, melting at a low temperature, it flows better and does a neater job. Polishing is done in seven stages, using different grades of sandpaper. Everything is directed to matching your measurements, taken by visiting a fitment specialist, and your desires, established in preliminary consultations. Sowter was formerly a chef, as well as a graphic designer and a racing cyclist, and you can see something of all these vocations in the job he does now.     A cycle superhighway in south London. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    Saffron&apos;s clients are not all people with money to burn, but also those who have yearned for something handbuilt for years and now want &quot;a bike for life&quot;. (And &quot;the really nice thing&quot; about these steel frames, says Sowter, is that they last for 60 or 70 years). He says the attraction is not only acquiring a machine that fits you and suits you, but also &quot;getting involved in the process&quot;, that your life and the life of your bike intertwine from the latter&apos;s conception. &quot;I never get anyone saying, &apos;I want to impress my friends&apos;,&quot; he says, even if this motivation is rarely completely lacking, &quot;but people put it across in subtle terms.&quot; The Saffron workshop offers a glimpse into the attractions of the cults of cycling to its devotees. It is about a close relationship between the human and the physical, or material, of a kind that in a world of disposable products is rare. It is about rhythms \u2013 if riding a bike involves speed, and often the more the better, making one by hand is slow. Saffron produces about four a month and has a six-month waiting list. There seems to be a peacefulness that comes from this close attention to a specific range of skills, and seclusion in this esoteric knowledge. At the same time, these skills and knowledge form the basis of a community with others of the same mind. Sowter knows the very few others in the same business and they are supportive of one another, sharing knowledge, not rivalrous. He is working on establishing a frame-builders&apos; guild. Cyclophilia offers a particular way of connecting with the world and I encounter a similar range when I meet Mike White, a co-founder (with James Lucas, who also created the Bristol Bike Project) of the quarterly Boneshaker magazine. A man with a pointed beard and inseparable beanie, it is important to him that his perfect-bound, matt-paper publication is printed rather than online. &quot;We all like the tactile, physical side,&quot; he says of cyclists, &quot;not neutered by glass between you and what you&apos;re experiencing. In a car, you&apos;re compartmentalised. On a bike, you feel it all \u2013 smell, humidity, temperature.&quot; Boneshaker started because Lucas &quot;kept hearing great stories that no cycling magazine would take&quot;. It prides itself on having &quot;no training tips, race diets or adverts&quot;. It is, says White, &quot;very collaborative. We do it for the love. We get stories from people all over the world. We might publish some crazy, overenthusiastic workshop guy from Berlin or Bratislava just pouring out the words.&quot; It is lightly edited, such that the imperfect but authentic language of the contributors remains on the page. He is telling me this in Roll for the Soul, a not-for-profit cafe in Bristol that is also a cycle shop and workshop (which, having collected a puncture on my way to Paddington, and then pushed my bike from Bristol Temple Meads to the cafe, I get the opportunity to use.) It is a non-elitist Rapha. &quot;We think of it as a village hall,&quot; goes the blurb, &quot;slap-bang in the middle of Bristol&quot;, where the aim is to &quot;make things happen and reclaim a bit of the city centre from corporate shiny stuff&quot;. The idea is that cycling is not just a means of transport, a leisure pursuit, or even a social activity, but a force for change, a micro-utopia. If much of cycling culture is individual, bottom-up, localised, entrepreneurial or insurrectionary, that is partly because government attempts to promote cycling have been erratic. The intention has been there for years, and there have been some achievements, but the task of retrofitting British cities for cycling, with too little money and too much opposition, has led to laughable cycle lanes becoming the stuff of websites and subjects for slots in Metro otherwise occupied by crazy pets. There are the lanes that start and then stop within a few feet, or point cyclists at people queuing for a bus, or tip them into the path of a truck, or guide them into the trunk of a tree that, in the abstract universe inhabited by whoever planned the lane, presumably isn&apos;t there. They have become emblems of you-couldn&apos;t-make-it-up official absurdity, environmental correctness gone mad, box-ticking bureaucracy.     Weird cycle lanes: the please-hit-tree, Grimsby.     See, for example, the pictures at anorak.co.uk or weirdcyclelanes.co.uk, which\u00a0celebrates the bike infrastructure of Brighton and Hove. To experience the ambitions and limitations of public cycling policy, you can sample CS2, one of Boris Johnson&apos;s trumpeted cycle superhighways. This is also the A11/A118, or Whitechapel Road/Mile End Road/Bow Road/Stratford High Street. It was called for a while &quot;High Street 2012&quot; in reference to the fact that it was the main route from the centre of London to the Olympic site and that part of the marathon was going to be run there, until it was rerouted to more photogenic locations. It includes two of the more lethal spots in the capital, an area in Aldgate and Bow roundabout, where three people have been killed since 2011. Last November, in a sudden spate of five deaths in London in nine days, three were on CS2. Inquests have found that the infrastructure was not the sole culprit, but one coroner has criticised the blue strips of paint that pass for cycle lanes while giving no legal or physical protection and called the superhighway &quot;an accident waiting to happen&quot;. And, indeed, it is not a comfortable ride. At the end nearest the City, there are only the &quot;ghost lanes&quot;, also called &quot;virtual lanes&quot; or &quot;blue surface treatment&quot;, the notional strips that as often as not are occupied by the nearside wheels of double-decker buses. In jams, cyclists take to the pavements to get around them. The immobile white-painted bikes and bunches of flowers that commemorate fatalities don&apos;t add to peace of mind and, approaching the Bow roundabout, it is hard not to dwell on the casualties there. Eventually, there is a new lane, properly separated, but which, as at least one blogger has pointed out, has a number of odd and dangerous design quirks. The lane then expires with a convoluted sign that asks cyclists to invade pedestrians&apos; space, then project themselves into bus lanes. This is now Stratford, home of the Olympics, but if you want to get to the velodrome, cathedral of the new bike nation, you have to weave unprotected along what are in effect the service roads of the Westfield shopping centre. CS2 is in truth an abysmal realisation of Boris Johnson&apos;s pledge &quot;to turn London into a cyclised city \u2013 a civilised city where people can ride their bikes safely and easily in a pleasant environment&quot;. It is a long way from being Denmark or the Netherlands, the two countries repeatedly cited as models for cycling infrastructure. In Groningen, they have multistorey bicycle parks. In Copenhagen, about 30% of journeys to work are made by bike, compared with the average in England and Wales of 2.9%, along an immaculate network of cycle paths. The cycling style is serene, mostly helmetless, confident that both traffic engineers and vehicles will take care of your wellbeing. It is nothing like the tense, defensive-aggressive London cyclist, armoured with high-visibility accoutrements. Maybe this is why the UN has decided that Denmark is the happiest country on Earth and Monocle magazine has called Copenhagen the most livable city. Nor is Britain much like France, nor even the United States. Peter Murray, chairman of the independent organisation New London Architecture, knows a lot about cycling in both countries: just turned 70, he leads a ride of architects and property developers from London to the MIPIM property fair in Cannes every March, and last year cycled in a group from Portland, Oregon, to Portland Place, London, with the help of an aircraft to cross the Atlantic. In France, he says, &quot;there is an inbred respect&quot;. When his peloton of property people goes by, &quot;lorry drivers go to the other side of the road, and people clap and go &apos;allez, allez&apos;&quot;. In the US, perhaps more surprisingly in a petrolhead society, there &quot;was amazing consideration&quot;. Truck drivers are &quot;professional \u2013 they act as if they know they&apos;re in control of a deadly object&quot;. He portrays Britain as a depressingly aggressive place where, when drivers see a group of cyclists, &quot;they just put their hands on the horn&quot;. (Sowter, however, is from South Africa and says that attitudes are worse there.) According to Murray, cities such as Portland and Minneapolis have exemplary provision. New York, thanks to Janette Sadik-Khan, who was transportation commissioner under former mayor Michael Bloomberg, has more sophisticated and successful arrangements than London. It has, in Transport Alternatives, a 40-year-old lobbying group that works co-operatively with government. The politics are more confrontational in London, says Murray. Britain, he says, should try less to imitate Denmark and the Netherlands, where &quot;the culture is just so different&quot;, and instead try to follow the US. In Britain, the most bike-friendly large city (that is, not counting places such as Cambridge) is Bristol. It was, at least, nominated as such by a magazine called Cycling Plus. It has its bottom-up culture, of the Bristol Bike Project, Boneshaker, and Roll for the Soul, and some undramatic but effective alterations to the roads have made the centre much more relaxed than London. In the 1970s, it pioneered cycle paths when the engineer John Grimshaw put together a group that converted a disused railway track to Bath, which remains delightful and popular. Grimshaw&apos;s group became Sustrans, which is now a national charity campaigning for and achieving what it calls &quot;healthier, cleaner and cheaper journeys&quot; and &quot;better, safer places to live in&quot;. Since last year, Bristol also has a directly elected mayor, George Ferguson, an architect of no political affiliation, who was one of the founders of Sustrans, and whose preferred transport is now an electrically assisted bike. He says he &quot;wants to change the culture where we have this constant fight between different modes of transport&quot;. He has brought in residents&apos; parking schemes to deter the commuters who drive into the city and park in its streets and he is introducing a 20mph limit. He is pushing forward an east-to-west waterside cycle route across the city. &quot;Every \u00a310m you spend on cycling is so much better value than in any other form of transport,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s about safe routes to schools, environment and health, and air quality, all for a fraction of what you would spend on an equivalent.&quot; Ferguson&apos;s plans are not universally popular. A traders&apos; association drove a tank into the city to protest at the damage, as they saw it, which residents&apos; parking schemes would do to their business. &quot;There will always be people,&quot; says Ferguson, &quot;who see restrictions on the use of a car as an attack on their liberty, but any civilised European city has them.&quot; Such things &quot;are seen as infringements on freedom until they happen and then they are accepted&quot;. He knows that Bristol is some way off matching other countries; if its cycling rates in the city are quite high, about three times the national average, that is still not very high compared with other European cities. &quot;If we are the most bike-friendly British city,&quot; he says, &quot;then British cities are not very bike-friendly.&quot; He currently has \u00a311m to spend on his plans, but &quot;I could spend another \u00a3100m very easily&quot;. But he says that Bristol &quot;is a brilliant city to be a testbed, because it&apos;s not easy&quot;. It has hills and rain. It lacks the straight continental boulevards that lend themselves to separated lanes. &quot;If you can make it work in Bristol,&quot; says Ferguson, &quot;you can make it work anywhere.&quot;     George Ferguson, Bristol's mayor, is trying to improve an already bicycle-friendly city. Photograph: Chris Bahn    Like other British cities, it has some catching up to do. Jon Usher, of Sustrans, says that it is still suffering from the effects of a motorway that, along with dual carriageways and roundabouts, was pushed into the city in the 60s and 70s, at a time when those fabled Dutch and Danes were already installing cycling infrastructure. In the Netherlands, he says, they have been spending \u00a316 per person per year, for 30 years, on improvements. Britain has more than a half-century to make up; not only has the country not invested in the same way, and created some hostile traffic engineering instead, but it has also developed a mentality about cars &quot;which is really difficult to unpick&quot;. The communities secretary, Eric Pickles, for example, has called on town halls to ditch &quot;their anti-car dogma&quot;, make town centres more accessible for motor vehicles, and undo their traffic calming measures. Cycling, in fact, embodies the weaknesses and strengths of British civic life. It is a palpably good thing if more people cycle, for health, for the environment, for the safety of pedestrians. It is a cheap, reliable and effective form of transport and one of the quickest ways to get about cities. Bikes use less space than cars. Cycling encourages interaction, as it is easier to stop a bike and chat to someone than it is a car. Despite the fears of traders, the evidence of New York and other cities is that bicycle provision is good for business: a cyclist is likely to visit a series of small shops, but a driver is more likely to go to a supermarket car park and load up with a week&apos;s worth of stuff. Yet neither the funding nor the organisation is there to make these obviously good things happen with any great speed. The debate is also conducted in adversarial terms, by both sides. It is seen as a zero-sum game in which what is good for cyclists is seen as bad for drivers, despite the fact that many people are both and despite the obvious truth that, each time someone switches from a car to a bike, they cause less congestion. Perhaps Pickles has a point that shops in market towns might benefit from easier car parking, but his vision doesn&apos;t seem to include the role that other forms of transport might play. It sounds more like a Faragist attempt to win cheap cheers. There is almost no political will to take on the essential task of balancing the legitimate concerns of all. With government haphazard, change comes more from private actions. In London, mayoral policies have contributed, in particular the cycle hire scheme that was initiated by Ken Livingstone and enacted under Boris Johnson, but if the city&apos;s streets feel very different from the way they did a decade ago, that is largely because many people simply decided to start cycling. Murray observes that a big change happened after the tube bombings in 2005: &quot;Suddenly, there were a whole lot more people on the road, some of them not very experienced. Cars were obliged to take notice.&quot; Initiatives come from all over the place, from an untypical politician such as Ferguson, and from pressure groups. The architectural practice of Norman Foster, himself a fanatical cyclist, has proposed a 135-mile network of cycling highways built above commuter railway lines. The Danish expert on urban design Jan Gehl tweeted that Foster&apos;s vision was not proper cycling, on the basis that it focused on the function of transport and nothing else. In measured and consistent Denmark, it isn&apos;t, but as one among London&apos;s multiple modes it possibly makes more sense. Myself, I am a functional cyclist. I use a bike to get around, as well as a car, public transport and taxis, and choose whichever seems best at a given moment. Sometimes, especially in bad weather, I have to persuade myself into the saddle, but more often regret it when my driving self wins the argument. I enjoy the freedoms and the exercise, but not the underlying tension that comes from knowing that every wrong decision has the potential, however slight, to be fatal. I have suffered one theft and maybe five accidents, one requiring attention in outpatients, none hospitalisation. I care enough to have a bike a notch above the basic, but the devotion of true enthusiasts is mysterious to me. I ask Sowter, who tells me that &quot;what gives me joy is the object that I am riding. It is the exercise and the endorphins, and the fact that every pedal stroke that comes from you equates into a movement. There&apos;s a lot of self-satisfaction in that.&quot; It is also about contact with nature: &quot;It&apos;s great way to be out, to be in the countryside, to go down country lanes.&quot; For some, it is about extremes of personal physical achievement, such as the Cent Cols Challenge, the &quot;ultimate endurance test&quot;, in which 100 summits are tackled in 10 days. Philip Deeker, who organises the challenges with the support of Rapha, has spoken of the &quot;art of suffering&quot;. He also said that &quot;to discover that preconceived notions about one&apos;s physical limits are mere perceptions that can be banished by unexpected achievement is an extremely liberating experience&apos;. This, he believes, is &quot;the real &apos;soul&apos; of\u00a0cycling&quot;. Cycling is both solipsistic and social. It offers a chance to inhabit a private universe, in which the machine becomes a flattering extension of your body and mind, but it is also the means to connect with like-minded others and interact more fully with the life of a city. At its worst, it creates a toxic mixture of aggression, entitlement and self-righteousness. Cyclists can be as competitive and status-conscious as any Porsche driver with, thanks to their green credentials, added sanctimony. Cycling culture can be overly male. It can be narcissistic and humourless. It can come with an understandable but overdeveloped sense of victimhood. Every cycling death is sad and wasteful, but it is striking by how much the greater numbers of pedestrian deaths get less attention. At its best, cycling encourages a gentle, benign, idealistic frame of mind. It heightens awareness of your surroundings and other people. It can be co-operative and unmaterialistic. It encourages alertness and attention. You are less likely to be a binge drinker or a couch potato if you ride a bike. For these reasons, as well as the benefits to health, environment and so on, it can make cities richer, subtler, more open and generous places in which to live.

They invested heavily in education. They pinpointed sectors in which they wanted to compete. They chose national champions and backed them over a prolonged period of time. They adopted export-focused economic strategies and were slow and cautious in opening up their domestic markets to foreign competition. They made sure that the financial sector was subservient to the needs of industry. This is just a thought experiment. Britain cannot be loosed from its geographical mooring and nor can it ever shake off the misguided notion that it is still a great manufacturing force. The likely takeover of AstraZeneca shows that all too clearly. If the government was truly serious about rebalancing the economy and arresting the hollowing out of manufacturing, it would be making it clear to Pfizer that its overtures to Astra were unwelcome. Instead, its attitude towards the proposed deal \u2013 and towards industrial policy more generally \u2013 is incoherent, short-termist and misguided. The incoherence stems from identifying the pharmaceutical sector as one in which Britain has a global advantage yet washing its hands of a deal that will allow one of the country&apos;s few genuinely world-class companies to be swallowed up. On the one hand, George Osborne uses his budgets to make research and development more attractive. On the other, the government is content to accept flimsy promises from Pfizer about safeguards for research and development. This flies in the face not just of Pfizer&apos;s record on closing down research facilities but also of the pharma industry as a whole, where the name of the game is consolidation and cost-saving. On average, past deals have seen average cuts in R&amp;D worth 30% of the pre-tax profits of the company taken over in a merger. Astra made pre-tax profits of about \u00a32bn in 2013. The short-termism is the failure to see beyond the current financial pressures on the industry, which arise partly as a result of patent expiry, partly as a result of the expense of developing new drugs, and partly as a result of austerity-beset health ministries seeking to save money. Consolidation makes short-term sense in this sort of bracing climate, which is why there has been so much merger and acquisition activity recently. But it is no accident that pharma is one of Britain&apos;s leading industrial sectors. Since the creation of the NHS in 1948, drug companies have been able to invest in new treatments safe in the knowledge that there will be a reliable customer. Indirectly, British taxpayers have provided considerable support for AstraZeneca and will be poorly served by the proposed Pfizer takeover. First will come the loss of high-skill jobs. Second, consolidation means less competition, which will drive up prices. As to why government policy is misguided, let&apos;s start with the obvious. The coalition doesn&apos;t have an industrial strategy; it has a tax strategy. One reason AstraZeneca is attractive to Pfizer is that corporation tax is lower in the UK than in the US. A merged company would have its corporate HQ in the US but be domiciled for tax purposes in the UK. For the time being, at least. Attracting foreign companies with the lure of low taxes is a race to the bottom. Sooner rather than later, another country will offer even juicier incentives. The deal speaks volumes about the lopsided nature of the relationship between corporations and politicians. Companies demand, ministers accede. Tax is one example; trade is another. Big business, especially in the US, has become extremely frustrated at the lack of progress in the Doha trade liberalisation talks, where it has proved impossible for Washington and Brussels to bulldoze proposals through as they once did. The new strategy involves cutting bilateral deals and bypassing the World Trade Organisation in sectors such as services. The US is trying to negotiate a trans-Pacific partnership (TPP) and a transatlantic trade and investment partnership (TTIP). Meanwhile a breakaway group of almost 50 countries is involved in talks about a trade in services agreement (TISA). These proposed trade deals have a number of things in common: the benefits tend to be vastly exaggerated; the talks are hidden from public scrutiny; and the proposals invariably involve ceding even more power to corporate interests, whether in the form of extra-territorial courts to settle investment disputes or making it harder to safeguard public services from privatisation. How would a transatlantic or a services trade agreement affect the ability of a future government to stand in the way of what will almost certainly become a hostile Pfizer bid for Astra, or to roll back privatisation? The complete lack of transparency in the negotiations means it is hard to know for sure, but a pound to a penny suggests it will become harder, not easier. Britain, needless to say, is full-throated in its support for both TTIP and TISA. That&apos;s because, despite all the talk about rebalancing and supporting key sectors, nothing has really changed. Government policy remains locked in the mindset of the 1980s, where the solution to each and every problem is to cut taxes, lower trade barriers and expose companies to the full blast of global competition. The success of this approach can be judged by the fact that manufacturing&apos;s share of GDP is barely above 10%, the UK&apos;s share of world manufacturing output is down to 3%, and there has not been a trade surplus in goods since the early 1980s. Still, at least somebody will be pleased that Astra, which accounts for almost a tenth of UK R&amp;D, is about to lose its independence. It is party time for the lawyers, the mergers and acquisitions advisers, the merchant banks and the PR teams working on the deal. As far as the City is concerned, the clock has been turned back. The glory days of deal-making are back. The crash was all a bad dream. Nothing has changed. Business as usual."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/08/chinese-experts-discussions-high-speed-beijing-american-railway", "publicationDate": "2014-05-08T19:00:44Z", "tags": ["China", "Rail transport", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Engineering", "Technology"], "sentences": ["According to the state-run China Daily, the tunnel technology is &quot;already in place&quot; and will be used to build a high-speed railway between the south-east province of Fujian and Taiwan."], "title": "Chinese experts 'in discussions' over building high-speed Beijing-US railway", "article": "China is considering plans to build a high-speed railway line to the US, the country&apos;s official media reported on Thursday. The proposed line would begin in north-east China and run up through Siberia, pass through a tunnel underneath the Pacific Ocean then cut through Alaska and Canada to reach the continental US, according to a report in the state-run Beijing Times newspaper. Crossing the Bering Strait in between Russia and Alaska would require about 200km (125 miles) of undersea tunnel, the paper said, citing Wang Mengshu, a railway expert at the Chinese Academy of Engineering. &quot;Right now we&apos;re already in discussions. Russia has already been thinking about this for many years,&quot; Wang said. The project \u2013 nicknamed the &quot;China-Russia-Canada-America&quot; line \u2013 would run for 13,000km, about 3,000km further than the Trans-Siberian Railway. The entire trip would take two days, with the train travelling at an average of 350km/h (220mph). The reported plans leave ample room for skepticism. No other Chinese railway experts have come out in support of the proposed project. Whether the government has consulted Russia, the US or Canada is also unclear. The Bering Strait tunnel alone would require an unprecedented feat of engineering \u2013 it would be the world&apos;s longest undersea tunnel \u2013 four times the length of the Channel Tunnel. According to the state-run China Daily, the tunnel technology is &quot;already in place&quot; and will be used to build a high-speed railway between the south-east province of Fujian and Taiwan. &quot;The project will be funded and constructed by China,&quot; it said. &quot;The details of this project are yet to be finalised.&quot; The Beijing Times listed the China-US line as one of four international high-speed rail projects currently in the works. The first is a line that would run from London via Paris, Berlin, Warsaw, Kiev and Moscow, where it would split into two routes, one of which would run to China through Kazakhstan and the other through eastern Siberia. The second line would begin in the far-western Chinese city of Urumqi and then run through Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran and Turkey to Germany. The third would begin in the south-western city of Kunming and end in Singapore. The routes are under various stages of planning and development, the paper said. Wang was not immediately available for comment. A man who picked up the phone at his office said he was traveling and would not respond to interview requests.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 9 May 2014.

Choking on my words, I apologised for how difficult I was finding it to talk about my wife&apos;s death over the phone. These days I never say sorry for expressing my grief \u2013 why on earth would anyone expect me not to be upset about the loss of the woman whom I buried just 14 months after our wedding? The lady on the other end of the line was kind, warm and informative. She made several suggestions for the sort of therapeutic activities I could practice with my son to help sustain his awareness of his mum: create a memory box; collate and caption a photograph album online to tell the story of her life; talking, sharing and remembering good times. Acquiring memories  Winston&apos;s Wish also introduced me to the concept of acquired memories. The thinking is that if you never stop talking to bereaved children about the people they have lost, they will grow up thinking they actually do remember them. This made sense to me. Although I had never lost a parent, I thought of my maternal grandfather who died when I was four. As an adult I&apos;ve always been unsure whether I actually remember him or my memories are from the stories shared by my family over the years. I realised that, either way it didn&apos;t matter to me because when he comes to mind I feel as if I know him, I see his face and hear his voice. Reason appeared to be making a gradual return and I could suddenly see that there was so much I could still do to keep Desreen&apos;s memory alive for my son. Pictures would go up on the wall and not come down. I would teach Jackson about Desreen through stories, photos, drawings and songs. I would tell him how much she loved him and how proud she would have been to see him making progress in his life. And I would be able to do both with such credibility, authority and sincerity because I knew that she had never felt a stronger sense of love and pride for anyone than she had for Jackson. I knew because she told me, not just through words but her actions, expressions and plans for the future. Naming memories A month after Desreen died I met my solicitor. My wife didn&apos;t take my surname when we married, partly because she had spent years establishing her own through her career in the fashion industry and partly because we thought Des Dutton made her sound like a professional snooker player. Our son, however, did. The name Jackson Bo Dutton carried no imprint of his mother&apos;s existence and so I wanted to change it. I decided that he should take her name, too, not least because I didn&apos;t want him to grow confused about the status of his parents&apos; relationship as an older child. It quickly occurred to me that it might be equally unclear for him to have a different surname to me, too. I realised that I wanted to take her family name, as well. We became Jackson Bo and Benjamin Brooks-Dutton. The hyphen was really important to me because it symbolised a joining of two families, one that couldn&apos;t be broken by death. I only wish I&apos;d done it while she was alive. Still, I know she would have loved the fact that she had stood her ground as a strong, independent woman while I became her &quot;wife&quot;.     Desreen and Jackson, August 2011.    Blogging memories  Next I started a blog. I desperately needed to find empathy and advice from other young widowers left to raise children alone. I knew that I needed a long-term outlet for my grief, too. But even in the beginning I realised that the words I wrote could one day help Jackson understand the impact of our loss. I suppose I could have kept a diary but, thinking ahead to my son&apos;s future, I imagined the potential awkwardness he would feel in reading something so inherently private. A blog would be there for ever for him to dip in and out of, if and when the time was right. Inking memories  I got a tattoo. When we got engaged, Desreen and I commissioned a scribe to create a monogram made up of our initials, including Jackson&apos;s, to be used on our wedding invitations. That same monogram featured on the order of service at Desreen&apos;s funeral and is carved into her headstone. I decided to have it tattooed on to my chest, as well. Despite being 33 at the time, I initially kept it a secret from my parents and my in-laws, and shared it only with Jackson. &quot;Daddy&apos;s got drawing!&quot; he squealed as I pulled my T-shirt down to reveal my new ink. &quot;What is it, Jackson?&quot; I asked, fully expecting him to know the answer. Pointing at each letter in turn he replied excitedly, &quot;It&apos;s Mummy, Daddy and Jackson!&quot; \u2013 he had seen the image many times before. I love that he knows Desreen, he and I will always be together in this place right above my heart.\u00a0 Boxing memories I began to collect the clothes my wife and son wore in photographs that showed them together. I would place the garments and pictures together in a memory box, along with the perfume she used to wear, for him to visit and revisit in later life. I understand, perhaps mostly through the lack of physical contact I now had with my wife, how important touch and smell can be in inducing memories. I wanted to be able to help Jackson remember Desreen with all of his senses. Recording memories  My friend Paul and I wrote a song. He&apos;s a professional musician and we had talked about doing something together for years, but we had always been drunk at the time. Paul had read almost every word on my blog and asked me if I would like to create a musical memorial to Desreen. Although I probably didn&apos;t realise it, I was finding it very hard to face my own happy memories of my wife. Grief consumed me and I somehow found it easier to deal with the bad times than to recall the good. Despite having never tackled a song before, I wrote the sombre lyrics to Dry Eyes in less than an hour after Paul sent me the melody. He performed and produced the track, which tells the story of the immediate aftermath of Desreen&apos;s death. It conjures dark memories, which I see no reason for my son to not have\u00a0access to should he want the detail when he&apos;s older.     Desreen and Jackson on her wedding day.    Writing memories  I began to write poems. Still finding it easier to document the grief I felt since Desreen&apos;s death, I struggled to capture the joy of life before. A friend suggested I try to fight this emotional battle through poetry. It had never crossed my mind before and, frankly, I was embarrassed to even try. I really had no idea of how to express myself in that way. And yet something in my head told me that being scared to try was ludicrous. As I am now forced to remind myself at times: what&apos;s the worst thing that can happen when the worst thing that can happen has already happened?\u00a0 Somehow I found this form of writing helped me to express things that I otherwise might have kept to myself. Negative thoughts that I found difficult to convey as long-winded prose finally spilled out and articulated the darkness in my mind. Love, which I so badly wanted to share for Jackson&apos;s sake, seemed less indulgent and sickly sweet when kept succinct. And being able to explain to my son what had happened to his mum began to make more sense expressed in language simple enough for a children&apos;s book. I wrote a book, too. I wouldn&apos;t say that the idea of having a book published was particularly important to me but creating something lasting that captured memories of Desreen for Jackson was; a scrap book created with care, attention and love could have had quite the same effect. A publisher, who later became my editor, contacted me after reading my blog. I was still in a very fragile state \u2013 it was three or four months since my wife&apos;s death \u2013 but I already knew that I could only embark on this project if its intentions were pure. &quot;Above all we want to help you publish the book that you want to write,&quot; was her message. I knew my aim in sharing our story would be to help other people either suffering the pain of loss or trying to support friends and family through loss. On a more personal level, whatever I wrote needed to act as a bank of happy and loving memories of my wife, deposited in our difficult present and to be withdrawn in what I hoped would become my son&apos;s more positive future. The copy of the book I would always care about the most would be the one eventually sitting on his shelf.\u00a0 Imagining memories I wrote to Desreen on behalf of Jackson, too. On the first Mother&apos;s Day after her death I drafted a letter to her from Jackson&apos;s point of view, explaining what he had been up to over the months. I decided to do this every year until he was able to do it for himself or until he wanted to stop. Until then I would place the letters in his memory box for when he is old enough to read.\u00a0 Discussing memories I took Jackson on a residential weekend for bereaved children. When things got too much and my son&apos;s grief-fuelled anger and confusion almost grew too intense to bear, I turned to a charity called Grief Encounter. It&apos;s founder, Shelley Gilbert, and I had become friends and I called upon her for advice at a time when I felt too weak and vulnerable to support Jackson alone. She encouraged me to join her and her team and a group of other bereaved parents and children at a weekend retreat north of London. There, Jackson and I were given the opportunity to remember, discuss and share our memories of Desreen, and consider our hopes and fears for the future through therapeutic activities. It was emotionally challenging but also incredibly helpful and moving.     Jackson and Desreen on holiday in Spain.    I can&apos;t remember having smiled more since my wife&apos;s death than when Jackson took a shine to a little girl about four years his senior, who bore a striking resemblance to his mother as a child.\u00a0&quot;Daddy, I&apos;m tired now,&quot; he told me for the first time in his sleep-resistant life. &quot;Can I take that girl to bed?&quot;\u00a0 Treasuring memories   I bought him a ring. By the time his third birthday came around most material things seemed to have lost their significance to me. Having once wondered whether a holiday to Disneyland might help fix us, I gradually came to terms with the fact that some wounds can&apos;t ever truly heal. I decided to stop trying to make things better with toys, trips and cheap things made in Taiwan. I thought a lot about what I could do to mark his first birthday without his mum and it came to me during a visit to Liberty, Desreen&apos;s favourite shop in the world and a place she had once joked about wanting to be buried in. In a\u00a0nod to my late wife&apos;s past and to my son&apos;s future, I bought Jackson a copy of his mum&apos;s wedding ring, which I now wear on the little finger of my left hand. It is exactly the same ring in the same size but his is set with tiny black diamonds instead of white ones and in my mind it is a gift from her rather than me. For now I wear both together but when the time comes to tell my son what I bought him for his third birthday, the ring will be his. I&apos;ll keep Desreen&apos;s white wedding band and he&apos;ll have an exact match in black \u2013 gifts both to and from her, which Jackson and I can treasure for the rest of our lives. Kissing memories I decorated the house for Christmas together with Jackson. I explained that Mummy&apos;s angel would watch over us from the top of the tree, that she had bought it and loved it when she was alive and that we could both kiss it, send her our love and put it in place together. I decided that each future Christmas we would buy a special decoration and dedicate it to Desreen. Crowdsourcing memories   I asked our friends to help. One day it occurred to me that Jackson might only get a one-dimensional view of his mum if I acted as her only memory catcher. I contacted friends who have creative talents that could bring Desreen&apos;s personality and passions to life. Paul&apos;s girlfriend, Nancy, designed a poster of Desreen looking beautiful and happy on holiday in California, surrounded by the words from her eulogy. Paul&apos;s brother, Michael, who I lived with when I first met Desreen, made a mix of her favourite house tracks that we all used to dance to during our clubbing days. Our friend Gareth sent Jackson and me a poem he had written soon after Desreen died, which he kept private until the first anniversary of her death. Another friend, Olive, created a comic strip depicting a trip Desreen and Jackson made to the zoo, where she bought him a toy monkey. I wrote the story and Olive illustrated it. And an old friend of Desreen&apos;s, James, who runs a childrenswear label called Jessie &amp; James, with his partner, Jessica, designed a garment called the Desreen dress. My wife loved their clothes and dressed Jackson in them often. In fact, the very last gift she bought him was a pair of their trousers. As a fashion enthusiast who was desperate for a little girl of her own, we all know how thrilled she would have been to be immortalised it such a stylish way.\u00a0 Maintaining memories Perhaps most important, though, is the fact that we talk about Desreen all the time. Whenever I express my pride in Jackson I tell him that his mummy would feel the same. When Jackson takes a shine to something Desreen also liked I let him know that he&apos;s just like her. I want him to get to know her even though she&apos;s not around. I can&apos;t help if his memories fade as he matures. I can&apos;t turn back the clock and bring her home. I can&apos;t wave a magic wand and make everything OK. But I can&apos;t brush her memory under the carpet, either. All I can really do now is honour it and continue to look for ways to keep my wife present in my little boy&apos;s life. And I will make it my purpose as a devoted husband and father to strive to achieve both for as long as I am fortunate enough to live. \u2022 It&apos;s Not Raining, Daddy, It&apos;s Happy by Benjamin Brooks-Dutton is published by Hodder, \u00a316.99.

Bavet is on a highway stretching from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam&apos;s commercial centre, to Cambodia&apos;s capital, Phnom Penh. On Thursday the death toll was unclear, although some news agencies reported at least 20 people had been killed. A top Taiwanese diplomat said rioters had stormed a large Taiwanese steel mill in Vietnam, killing at least one Chinese worker and injuring 90 more. Huang Chih-peng said the violence took place late on Wednesday and early on Thursday at the Formosa steel mill in central Vietnam.      According to the Wall Street Journal, a Chinese contractor and a Vietnamese worker died in the violence. China&apos;s state-run People&apos;s Daily tweeted that 10 Chinese nationals went missing when protesters ransacked a Chinese factory. A doctor at a hospital in the central Vietnamese province of Ha Tinh told Reuters that five Vietnamese workers and 16 other people described as Chinese died during anti-China rioting on Wednesday night. &quot;There were about 100 people sent to the hospital last night. Many were Chinese. More are being sent to the hospital this morning,&quot; the doctor said. Earlier this week mobs burned and looted scores of foreign-owned factories in southern Vietnam, believing they were Chinese-run when many were actually Taiwanese or South Korean. No deaths were reported in those initial attacks. On Thursday, China&apos;s embassy in Vietnam urged the country&apos;s public security authorities to take &quot;effective measures&quot; to protect its nationals&apos; personal safety and legal rights. The embassy made the remark in a statement published on its website, adding that China had launched an emergency mechanism to cope with the effects of anti-Chinese riots in its southern neighbour. Anti-Chinese sentiment has been running high in Vietnam ever since Beijing deployed an oil rig into disputed waters in the South China Sea on 1 May. There have been encounters including ramming and exchanges of water cannon between Chinese vessels operating near the rig and boats from Vietnam, which wants China out of the area. According to the English-language version of the Tuoi Tre newspaper, some 600 people have been arrested in Vietnam&apos;s southern provinces, where riots erupted on Tuesday amid reports of looting and attacks on police officers. The government has since issued stark warnings to the Chinese that continued so-called aggression, which had to date been met with diplomacy, would probably turn ugly if it persisted. With reports on Wednesday from the Vietnam coastguard that the Chinese had also sent two amphibious ships equipped with anti-air missiles to protect their oil rig, commander Major General Nguyen Quang Dam said it would &quot;make no concession to China&apos;s wrongful acts&quot; and stressed: &quot;Their violent acts have posed serious threats to the lives of Vietnamese members of law enforcement.&quot; An op-ed piece in the English-language daily Vietnam News was just as transparent with its words: &quot;The Vietnamese people are angry. The nation is angry. We are telling the world that we are angry. We have every right to be angry.&quot; &quot;China should stop violating international law and respect Vietnam&apos;s sovereignty,&quot; it continued, adding that China&apos;s seeming aggression &quot;smacks of a bull doing something wrong just because it can&quot;. &quot;Over thousands of years, we have shown that we never cease fighting aggressors,&quot; the op-ed added. &quot;We are proud of our freedom-fighting forefathers and resistance is in our blood. We are a small country, but we are not weak. We will stand as one, united in the cause of protecting our motherland&apos;s integrity.&quot; China&apos;s foreign minister, Wang Yi, &quot;urged Vietnam not to attempt to further complicate and aggravate the current maritime friction&quot;, the state-run Global Times newspaper reported on Thursday. &quot;China&apos;s position on safeguarding its legitimate sovereign rights and interests is firm and clear and will not change,&quot; he told Indonesia&apos;s foreign affairs minister Marty Natalegawa in a phone conversation, the Global Times said. The newspaper condemned the protests in an editorial, calling them &quot;the most stunning attack [on] foreign businesses in East Asia in recent years&quot;. &quot;The turmoil is the outcome of Hanoi&apos;s years of anti-China propaganda,&quot; it said. &quot;Without legitimate grounds and practical capability, Vietnam fabricates and hypes up its jurisdiction over the Xisha and Nansha islands [AKA the Paracel and Spratly islands]. This uncompromising stance, in an attempt to bring its people together, has actually cornered itself.&quot; China&apos;s tourism administration has posted a note to its website urging Vietnam-bound tourists to &quot;carefully consider&quot; their plans. Taiwan&apos;s ministry of foreign affairs plans to print thousands of stickers saying &quot;I am from Taiwan&quot; in Vietnamese and English and distribute them to local Taiwanese business owners, to help them avoid the wrath of anti-China mobs. A ministry spokesperson confirmed the plan, but added that the stickers have not yet been distributed. In 2012 Chinese authorities permitted large-scale anti-Japan protests amid rising tensions between the two countries over competing territorial claims in the East China Sea. Protesters in cities across the country vandalised Japanese shops and smashed Japanese-made cars before authorities ordered them to disperse. China&apos;s propaganda authorities are censoring coverage of the protests, according to a leaked circular obtained by the online magazine China Digital Times. &quot;Absolutely do not report on any news related to &apos;Chinese-funded enterprises in Vietnam being attacked by Vietnamese,&apos;&quot; it said. &quot;Do not republish foreign coverage.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/15/vietnam-anti-china-protests-oil-rig-dead-injured", "publicationDate": "2014-05-15T19:05:21Z", "tags": ["Vietnam", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Oil", "Commodities", "Business", "China", "Cambodia", "Malaysia", "Taiwan", "Singapore"], "sentences": ["Early Thursday morning a 1,000-strong mob stormed a giant Taiwanese steel mill in Ha Tinh province, central Vietnam, where they set buildings ablaze and chased out Chinese employees, according to a Taiwanese diplomat, Huang Chih-peng.", "The attack on the steel mill comes just two days after other mobs burned and looted scores of foreign-owned factories in south Vietnam, believing they were Chinese-run, though many were actually Taiwanese or South Korean.", "More than 600 are believed to have gone to Cambodia, while scores gathered at Ho Chi Minh airport and bought one-way tickets to Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore and China.", "China&apos;s tourism administration urged Vietnam-bound tourists to carefully consider their plans, while Taiwan&apos;s ministry of foreign affairs was printing thousands of stickers saying &quot;I am from Taiwan&quot; in Vietnamese and English and distributing them to local Taiwanese business owners, to help them avoid the wrath of anti-China mobs."], "title": "At least 21 dead in Vietnam anti-China protests over oil rig", "article": "At least 21 people were killed and nearly 100 injured in Vietnam on Thursday during violent protests against China in one of the deadliest confrontations between the two neighbours since 1979.

The violence has been sparked by the dispute concerning China stationing an oil rig in an area of the South China Sea claimed by Vietnam. The two nations have been fighting out a maritime battle over sovereignty and that battle has now seemingly come ashore.

The protests have sparked an exodus of Chinese nationals, many of whom have fled to neighbouring countries or further. More than 600 are believed to have gone to Cambodia, while scores gathered at Ho Chi Minh airport and bought one-way tickets to Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore and China. On Thursday, China&apos;s embassy in Vietnam urged the police to take &quot;effective measures&quot; to protect Chinese citizens&apos; safety and legal rights. China&apos;s tourism administration urged Vietnam-bound tourists to carefully consider their plans, while Taiwan&apos;s ministry of foreign affairs was printing thousands of stickers saying &quot;I am from Taiwan&quot; in Vietnamese and English and distributing them to local Taiwanese business owners, to help them avoid the wrath of anti-China mobs. Anti-Chinese sentiment, while never far below the surface in Vietnam, has hit a formidable peak since Beijing&apos;s deployment of the oil rig in disputed waters in the South China Sea on 1 May. In an attempt to assert sovereignty Vietnam quickly sent a flotilla of ships to the area; these became involved in skirmishes with 80 Chinese boats sent to protect the oil rig. China accused the Vietnamese ships of ramming its vessels after the Chinese fleet deployed water cannon against the Vietnamese. On Wednesday China reportedly sent two amphibious ships equipped with anti-air missiles as further defence. The Vietnamese government has issued stark warnings to the Chinese that this &quot;aggression&quot;, which had to date been met with Vietnamese diplomacy, would turn ugly if it continued. Vietnam would &quot;make no concession to China&apos;s wrongful acts&quot;, Major General Nguyen Quang Dam, the coast guard commander, told local media. He said: &quot;Their violent acts have posed serious threats to the lives of Vietnamese members of law enforcement.&quot; An article in the English-language daily Vietnam News was just as blunt: &quot;The Vietnamese people are angry. The nation is angry. We are telling the world that we are angry. We have every right to be angry. &quot; &quot;Over thousands of years we have shown we never cease fighting aggressors. We are proud of our freedom-fighting forefathers, and resistance is in our blood. We are a small country, but we are not weak. We will stand as one, united in the cause of protecting our motherland&apos;s integrity.&quot; China&apos;s foreign minister, Wang Yi, urged Vietnam &quot;not to attempt to further complicate and aggravate the current maritime friction&quot;, according to the state-run Global Times newspaper. The paper said that Wang told Indonesia&apos;s foreign affairs minister, Marty Natalegawa: &quot;China&apos;s position on safeguarding its legitimate sovereign rights and interests is firm and clear and will not change.&quot; . On Thursday night China&apos;s top military leader blamed the Obama administration&apos;s new focus on Asia for various disputes in the East and South China seas, saying &quot;some neighbouring countries&quot; are using it as an opportunity to provoke problems. Speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, People&apos;s Liberation Army&apos;s chief of the general staff Gen Fang Fenghui also warned that the US must be objective about tensions between China and Vietnam or risk harming relations between Washington and Beijing. He defended China&apos;s deployment of an oil rig in the South China Sea and said Beijing has no intention of abandoning the drilling despite the protests it has spawned in Vietnam. While China and Vietnam have considerable political and economic ties, anti-Chinese sentiment in Vietnam goes back more than 1,000 years to when it was a Chinese colony. The quest for sovereignty and self-rule has long been a theme, as has what Vietnam sees as China&apos;s endless provocation over maritime boundaries around the Paracel and Spratly Islands in the South China Sea \u2013 an area that about 10 countries lay full, or partial, claim to \u2013 because of its rich oil and gas reserves. The recent attacks on Vietnam&apos;s factories and industrial parks could damage the country&apos;s economy. Industrial zones, like the Ha Tinh area where the mill was set ablaze, generate a third of Vietnam&apos;s total export revenue, according to Reuters. Vietnam&apos;s prime minister, Nguyen Tan Dung, issued a message Thursday urging Vietnamese authorities to protect foreign investors. Businesses are expected to receive payouts for incurred damages. While it seems the Vietnamese and Chinese governments each want to downplay the severity of the situation \u2013 a leaked Chinese government circular obtained by the online China Digital Times urged media to &quot;not report on any news&quot; regarding the protests \u2013 the repercussions are most closely felt on the ground. &quot;People don&apos;t feel safe here,&quot; Xu Wen Hong, a Chinese national who works at one of Vietnam&apos;s iron and steel companies and bought a one-way ticket to China, told Reuters. &quot;We just want to get out of Vietnam. We&apos;re scared, of course. With all the factories burning, anyone would be scared.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/16/china-vietnam-protests-territorial-dispute", "publicationDate": "2014-05-16T12:57:37Z", "tags": ["Vietnam", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["News that further protests against Chinese factories and businesses have been planned across the country for 18 May, has sparked even more fear, says Borshow Chen, director general of Taiwan&apos;s Economic and Cultural Office in Ho Chi Minh City.", "Unofficial data shows that roughly 40,000 Taiwanese live in Vietnam, he adds, and over the past 30 years a strong Taiwanese-Vietnamese tie has been forged: some 4,000 Taiwanese companies here, worth $30bn (\u00a318bn), employ about 1 million Vietnamese, at risk of losing money \u2013 and job opportunities \u2013 if these protests continue.", "&quot;Over 2,000 Taiwanese people have already left."], "title": "China warns Vietnam over deadly protests in territorial dispute", "article": "  China has castigated Vietnam over an outbreak of deadly protests against a Chinese oil rig in a disputed maritime zone \u2013 the worst clashes between the two countries in more than three decades. On Friday, as the protests that have racked Vietnam over much of the past week began to abate, China&apos;s state media issued a flurry of threatening editorials accusing Hanoi of tacitly supporting the violence. The state newswire Xinhua said that Vietnam was solely responsible for the discord. China Daily urged Hanoi to &quot;shoulder full responsibility for whatever serious consequences the crimes [would] have on China-Vietnam ties&quot;. Thousands of protesters vandalised and set fire to scores of factories at two industrial parks this week in the southern Vietnamese province of Binh Duong and the central province of Ha Tinh. The death toll remains unclear. A doctor told Reuters that five Vietnamese workers and 16 others &quot;described as Chinese&quot; were killed during the rioting. Chinese state media said more than a dozen people, most of them Chinese, were dead or missing. Factory owners have estimated that one or two people died. The protests have triggered an exodus of thousands of Chinese businessmen and their families, many of whom have been living in Vietnam for years. News that further protests against Chinese factories and businesses have been planned across the country for 18 May, has sparked even more fear, says Borshow Chen, director general of Taiwan&apos;s Economic and Cultural Office in Ho Chi Minh City. &quot;The government is not giving us full 100% assurance that these protests won&apos;t go ahead \u2013 which is not good,&quot; he says. Unofficial data shows that roughly 40,000 Taiwanese live in Vietnam, he adds, and over the past 30 years a strong Taiwanese-Vietnamese tie has been forged: some 4,000 Taiwanese companies here, worth $30bn (\u00a318bn), employ about 1 million Vietnamese, at risk of losing money \u2013 and job opportunities \u2013 if these protests continue. &quot;This is resulting in a total loss of confidence for us in the Vietnamese government,&quot; he continues. &quot;Over 2,000 Taiwanese people have already left. If these demonstrations go ahead, what will happen next?&quot; The latest round of tensions began on 1 May, when state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation deployed an oil rig in a patch of disputed territory 150 miles from Vietnam&apos;s coast. China maintains that the rig is in its &quot;indisputable sovereign territory&quot; near the south-western end of the Paracel islands, a 5,800 sq mile archipelago that it claims. It plans to operate the rig until typhoon season begins on 15 August. China is Vietnam&apos;s largest trade partner, and the editorials warned that Vietnam could suffer economically from its resistance to China&apos;s territorial claims. &quot;Vietnam&apos;s failure to rein in deadly mob attacks against foreign nationals and investment \u2026 tarnishes Vietnam&apos;s international image and undermines the government&apos;s credibility,&quot; said a Xinhua editorial. The Vietnamese government claims that 600 people have been arrested in connection with the attacks since Tuesday. Vietnam&apos;s prime minister sent a text message on Friday to millions of Vietnamese encouraging them to &quot;defend the fatherland&apos;s sacred sovereignty&quot; while refraining from violence, according to the Associated Press. The message did not explicitly condemn the riots. The announcements have done little to combat panic among Chinese nationals in Vietnam, many of whom have fled the country. About 600 have sought refuge in Cambodia, a police spokesman told Reuters on Thursday. Joe Biden, the US vice-president, has said the US is &quot;seriously concerned&quot; about China&apos;s &quot;dangerous&quot; actions in the region. During a visit to Washington, General Fang Fenghui, the Chinese army&apos;s chief of general staff, blamed the US for inflaming regional tensions. The &quot;border territory which has passed down from our ancestors into the hands of our generation \u2013 we cannot afford to lose an inch,&quot; he said. &quot;We do not make trouble. We do not create trouble. But we are not afraid of trouble.&quot; Analysts say Sino-Vietnamese relations may be at their worst since the two countries fought a fierce, month-long border war in early 1979. Chinese troops stormed northern Vietnam soon after Vietnam invaded Cambodia, which was then led by the China-friendly Khmer Rouge. China and Vietnam did not normalise diplomatic relations until 1991."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/may/17/taiwan-taipei-street-food-markets", "publicationDate": "2014-05-17T06:00:00Z", "tags": ["Taiwan holidays", "Travel", "Food and drink", "Asia", "Street food"], "sentences": ["This Taiwanese staple begins as regular tofu which is fermented in basins of brine until it reaches a malodorous ripeness \u2013 it is then deep fried to render the outside crispy.", "Taiwan probably has the best night market scene in the world and some of the most exciting street food in Asia.", "With little space at home to cook, the Taiwanese prefer to head out almost every night to the heaving markets for the cheap snacks \u2013 or xiaochi \u2013 that are found across the island \u2013 on corners, in clusters of food-devoted streets or at one of over 100 night markets.", "Photograph: Lap-Fai Lee    &quot;A melting pot of cuisines&quot;

Clouds of smoke waft above the dozens of small stalls that make up Taipei&apos;s Ningxia night market, all brightly lit, sitting under coloured signs, beckoning customers to tables loaded with glossy, roasted duck heads and necks, intestines and hearts of every conceivable nature, piping hot bowls of noodles and freshly made dumplings. Stepping deeper into the elbow-jostling crowd, my nose leads my eyes towards frying chicken (often lushly marinated in soya milk then spiced and floured), coal-roasted squid, poached quail eggs, pig&apos;s blood rice cake, even frog spawn and skewered and grilled crickets. I try gooey omelette of sweet potato studded with small, fat salty oysters and covered in sweet, vinegary, ketchupy sauce. And gelatinous mochi rice balls, topped with peanut and sesame shavings. Above it all is the unmistakeable stench of stinky tofu. This Taiwanese staple begins as regular tofu which is fermented in basins of brine until it reaches a malodorous ripeness \u2013 it is then deep fried to render the outside crispy. I muster one biteful and the taste is, well, fine, but the putrid smell lingers on your clothes and in your hair and, for me, hangs on in the memory for just a little too long. Taiwan probably has the best night market scene in the world and some of the most exciting street food in Asia. With little space at home to cook, the Taiwanese prefer to head out almost every night to the heaving markets for the cheap snacks \u2013 or xiaochi \u2013 that are found across the island \u2013 on corners, in clusters of food-devoted streets or at one of over 100 night markets. Those with no language skills simply stand in front of the stall, point to what they want and use their digits to say how many. Stallholders then write the price down, with dishes generally costing between 60p and \u00a31.20.     A cook prepares for the evening rush at one of Taipei\u2019s ever-popular street food markets. Photograph: Lap-Fai Lee    &quot;A melting pot of cuisines&quot; is an oft-used cliche \u2013 but the food of Taiwan really is. Inhabited first by aborigines, the island sitting between the South and East China Seas was settled by Fujianese then Hakka people from mainland China before being &quot;discovered&quot; by the Portuguese in the 16th century, colonised by the Dutch in the 17th century, followed by the Spanish and then, between 1895 and 1945, the Japanese. At the end of the Chinese civil war, Chiang Kai-shek and the defeated Kuomintang army retreated to Taiwan with more than two million people, including many of the mainland&apos;s best chefs. I am being guided through Taiwan, its culinary history and the wondrous world of xiaochi by the team of street food vendors who last year won the Young British Foodie award and two British Street Food awards for Bao, a London-based bar and market stall championing Taiwanese dishes and ingredients. Er Chen Chang was born in Taiwan but came to boarding school in the UK in 2005 and stayed. She met Shing Tat Chung at Slade School of Fine Art and, together with Shing&apos;s sister Wai-Ting (Ting for short), decided to make something of their gastronomic passion. &quot;When we travelled around Taiwan, we loved the baos (buns) \u2013 they had this combination of flavours that just blew us away,&quot; says Shing. &quot;It was the first time we&apos;d tried peanut shavings, then there was the soft bun, the salty pork, the sour pickles. There was a great challenge for us to see how far we could go to make that better.&quot; Demand for Bao&apos;s baos means the threesome is now looking for premises in central London. They&apos;re leading a vanguard of what seems to be a burgeoning love for buns in the UK, a new craving that was gestated at the New York restaurant (now group) Momofuku, whose founding chef David Chang has been dubbed &quot;the king of pork buns&quot;. For this trip to Taiwan, the Bao group has gathered a bunch of like-minded food lovers via the crowd-sourcing travel site Open Trips. But it is a foray that similarly greedy adventurers can replicate with the help of Er Chen&apos;s guide to the foodie nooks and crannies of her home city (see below). &quot;You can come and do this yourself as Taipei is an easy city to negotiate, the public transport system, called the MRT, is great and cheap.&quot;     A tea ceremony. Photograph: Lap-Fai Lee    We travel to Ningxia by taxi (dirt cheap if there&apos;s a few of you) and the Bao group heads straight for the deep-fried taro stall with its biscuity smell. The queue snakes along the pavement and there is a 20-minute wait for crispy balls of tuber. &quot;I love that people do one thing really well, adapting and perfecting their recipes. If there&apos;s a queue, it means they make the best. If you see a queue for food in Taiwan, get in it,&quot; Er Chen advises. So we do, waiting half an hour for a spring onion omelette inside a sweet-glazed hot sesame flatbread at Fu Hang Dou Jiang at Huashan Market (Zhongxi\u00e0o East Road, Zhongzheng), a famous breakfast joint which shuts at 10am, where Er Chen would come with her family to eat curdled milk with breadsticks; and at Din Tai Fung Dumpling House, Taiwan&apos;s most famous restaurant, where we debate how to eat our xiaolongbao \u2013 soup dumplings (with roots in Shanghai) encased in translucent skin and holding a puddle of broth and a ball of pork. At Nanmen indoor produce market, stallholders proffer sour cherries, peanuts that are almost black when you pop them from the shell, and samples of Jinhua-style ham. Tables are piled with the remarkable fruit of this island \u2013 pineapples, mangoes, guavas. In the basement, people are hand-rolling dumplings, smiling. Hanging on one stall is the famous black chicken, known as a Silkie, with blue-ish black flesh and bones and a deep, gamey flavour. &quot;I remember when I was young my grandmother would make &apos;healthy soup&apos; from black chicken and said it would make me tall. It definitely worked,&quot; laughs Er Chen. &quot;I am much taller than my parents.&quot;     Dishes from Audrey's cooking class.  Photograph: Lap-Fai Lee    We buy ingredients for a cookery class at Teacher Yong&apos;s Cookery School where Er Chen, Ting and Shing reveal some (but not all) of the secrets of making their bun of unfathomable fluffiness (you can book something similar at kitchenivy.com) and when we exit down seven flights of stairs, we are thrust into the busy Ximending area which is packed with young people. Beyond its fashion shops, little sides alleys with stalls selling cheap tat and gay bars (where you can drink outside) is a city that&apos;s unfairly under-rated as a tourist destination. We visit Buddhist and Taoist temples, watch the highly choreographed changing of the guard at the elaborately grand Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall, take the fastest lift in the world to the top of the Taipei 101 tower (at 508 metres it was once the world&apos;s tallest building), watch early morning tai chi in the park and ponder the world&apos;s greatest collection of Chinese artefacts at the National Palace Museum. The city&apos;s low-rise architecture makes it seem less dense than many Asian cities and, in recent years, it has cleaned up its smoggy act and cleared green spaces. Taipei is working on showing visitors that what it lacks in architecture, it makes up for with relaxed and friendly people, a rich natural larder and some of the best Chinese food in the world. From the capital, we take the high-speed train 180 miles south to Tainan, the oldest city in Taiwan, and certainly more beautiful than the capital. We watch the landscape change, passing trees in blossom and beginning to fruit, until we reach the station on the outskirts of the city. Our first stop is a pavement cafe where we have breakfast bowls of turkey rice for less than a pound and &quot;little sausage wrapped in big sausage&quot; at the country&apos;s biggest night market, Hua Yuan. There&apos;s more space here, enough to sit on pop-up tables and chairs, which means we can really savour our next find \u2013 pancakes filled with milky ice-cream, peanut shavings and coriander. They are divine. On the train back to Taipei, the Bao group concedes that stinky tofu won&apos;t be making it on to the list of new dishes they want to add to their London menu. But that ice-cream pancake? Shing smiles: &quot;That was just amazing. We&apos;ll definitely be trying our own version of that when we get back.&quot; Taipei food tips by Er Chen Chang of Bao     Hsu Ren Ping's noodle factory.

But all that changed last week, when violent protests saw at least 21 people killed and 100 injured as mobs set fire to and looted businesses and factories, hunted down Chinese workers and attacked police. The provocation came from China&apos;s move to station an oil rig in a maritime boundary area 150 miles from Vietnam&apos;s shoreline. &quot;Look: we&apos;re always worried about the north,&quot; says Nguyen, referring to China. &quot;They conquered us for 4,000 long years, so every move that China makes can spark fear within us.

Four days after the rampage by an angry mob numbering in the thousands, factories have hung large banners outside proclaiming allegiance to Vietnam. &quot;We support Vietnam,&quot; reads one white cloth stretched delicately across a Singaporean-owned factory. &quot;This is not a Chinese company \u2013 we oppose China&apos;s placement of the oil rig,&quot; says another banner at a still-smouldering Taiwanese shoe factory. These vast industrial zones generate a third of Vietnam&apos;s total export revenue, with factories manufacturing shoes, clothes and electronics for international companies such as Apple, Adidas, Nike and Walmart. The forced closures of such factories means a significant drop in profits, as well as loss of investor confidence. &quot;Vietnam&apos;s failure to rein in deadly mob attacks against foreign nationals and investment \u2026 tarnishes Vietnam&apos;s international image and undermines the government&apos;s credibility,&quot; cautioned a recent Xinhua editorial in China. Vietnam&apos;s prime minister, Nguyen Tan Dung, issued a message on Thursday urging Vietnamese authorities to protect foreign investors, and businesses are expected to receive payouts for incurred damages. But is such urging genuine? While China and Vietnam have fought battles in the past \u2013 the most recent in 1979 \u2013 what is unusual about these recent disputes is Hanoi&apos;s tolerance, or even support, for the local protests directed against Beijing, says Lingling Mao, senior lecturer in Chinese studies at Nottingham Trent University. &quot;Vietnam and China&apos;s relationship has gone from comrades to foes over the last 45 years&quot; she said, adding that these kinds of industrial protests in the countries were the result of clashes over national interests as well as environmental and ideological disagreements. The US expressed &quot;serious concern&quot; over China&apos;s aggression last week, just as leading Beijing newspapers warned Vietnam that Hanoi must &quot;shoulder full responsibility for whatever serious consequences the [recent] crimes have on China-Vietnam ties&quot;.A leading Chinese general later countered that President Obama&apos;s Asian &quot;pivot&quot; was to blame. &quot;Some neighbouring countries are using this opportunity of America&apos;s pivot to stir up [trouble],&quot; Fang Fenghui, chief of the general staff of the People&apos;s Liberation Army, told a Pentagon press briefing. He added that China &quot;cannot afford to lose an inch&quot; of what he claims was &quot;ancestral territory&quot;. Vietnam&apos;s quest for sovereignty and self-rule from China has long been a thorn in its side, as has what Vietnam sees as China&apos;s endless provocation over maritime boundaries around the Paracel and Spratly island chains in the South China Sea \u2013 an area to which about 10 countries lay full, or partial, claim \u2013 because of its rich oil and gas reserves. Spats over boundaries have flared for years. But this most recent standoff started on 1 May, when China sent an oil rig to the Paracel islands, 150 miles from Vietnam&apos;s coast, which it plans to operate until typhoon season starts in August. Protests turned into riots, and both have done far more harm than good, said Nguyen Quoc Hong, a taxi driver who has lived in Binh Duong for the past decade. &quot;The factories have closed down and now foreign investors are scared. This year it&apos;s already been hard for people to find work \u2013 but this will just make it harder.&quot; The violence has sparked an exodus of foreigners from Vietnam, many of whom have been living here for decades. Six hundred Chinese nationals have fled to Cambodia, while an estimated 2,000 Taiwanese have gone. Those who have remained in Binh Duong have piled into its two main hotels, where they are waiting out the days with trepidation. &quot;Am I scared? Yes, I&apos;m scared,&quot; says Derek Chang, a Taiwanese sales representative at a textile export factory. &quot;It&apos;s a dangerous situation. I&apos;ve been here five years and I&apos;ve never seen this before.&quot; With further Hanoi-sanctioned anti-China protests planned Sunday, he worries he may soon find himself with very few options. &quot;If things get worse tomorrow, I&apos;ll definitely go back to Taiwan,&quot; he said.No less telling is caf\u00e9 owner Nguyen&apos;s view of Vietnam&apos;s future \u2013 one in which Beijing controls Hanoi once again through a series of orchestrated zero-sum games, inducing economic subversion to its far mightier, and far larger, northern neighbour. &quot;I won&apos;t be another one of China&apos;s puppets,&quot; she said resolutely. &quot;If Vietnam won&apos;t stand up to China, then I, too, will leave.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/18/chelsea-flower-show-highlights-preview", "publicationDate": "2014-05-18T05:00:00Z", "tags": ["Chelsea flower show", "Gardening advice", "Gardens", "Life and style"], "sentences": ["Photograph: Alamy    As well as selections of some of their favoured daphniphyllum and schefflera, there will be a\u00a0range of maples hardy across a range of temperatures, including Acer campbellii var campbellii; the Vietnamese A heptaphlebium with bronze foliage; A\u00a0takesimense from Korea, which is cold-hardy and has spectacular autumn colour, and one genus completely new to cultivation, Uocodendron whartonii, which the Wynn-Joneses discovered in Taiwan in 2003."], "title": "Chelsea: Flower Show highlights", "article": "The Chelsea Flower Show falls in the week that seems to teeter miraculously between spring and summer. It is a time that is full of promise, but the show cheats it by just enough to whet your appetite for what is yet to come \u2013 roses in abundance, strawberries smelling of real strawberries and tapering lupins in full and spectacular flower. It should be a good show this year, in contrast to last year&apos;s, which followed a hard and drawn-out winter. The growers have little to complain about after the mild winter and well-measured spring, so we should be in for a good display of flower and optimism. I have the luxury of visiting during the build-up to the opening. The show gardens have now got wise to the press, the photographers and the filmmakers, and by the Saturday many are ready, waiting smugly for the limelight to shine. But under the shade of the tent, there is a hushed concentration as the organised chaos within is slowly honed to perfection. You can talk to the growers, if they can be drawn away from unwrapping their irises and peonies from cotton-wool or dusting their auriculas, to glean years&apos; worth of hard-won knowledge. By Monday&apos;s press preview this magical atmosphere has gone, the people walking the aisles doing so in business and party suits. It&apos;s a day for meeting and greeting, champagne, royalty and industry lunches. This year I have been asked to speak at the RHS President&apos;s Lunch in support of its apprenticeship scheme, which was launched last year to bring to the attention of the government the fact that horticulture is an undervalued and underinvested industry with a bad reputation among young people. The apprenticeship scheme is being delivered through the RHS School of Horticulture and will provide 16 apprenticeships over four years based at the RHS gardens at Wisley, Hyde Hall, Rosemoor and Harlow Carr. My own education started at Wisley on a two-year diploma course which was, in many ways, the equivalent to this scheme. It was the best start I\u00a0could possibly have had, given that there were no garden design courses and a\u00a0horticultural education offered my only route in. A number of RHS apprentices will be helping to build some of the show gardens this year, and the combined exposure to outstanding plantsmanship and first-rate design that Chelsea offers can set youngsters off on different paths.     Flower power: tulip mania inside the Grand Pavilion. Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA Archive/Press Association Ima    I, too, saw behind the scenes when, as Wisley students, we came in to sweep the aisles ahead of the royal visit. Then, in the early 90s, at the age of 28, I was lucky enough to be given my first show garden. There were very few young garden designers in those days and I was lucky to benefit from the experience and early exposure that cutting your teeth at Chelsea gives you. This year there is plenty of new blood looking to make a mark, and many gardens have strong narrative themes of sustainability, conservation and environmental responsibility. Twenty-six-year-old Hugo Bugg was voted RHS Young Designer of the Year in 2010, and is one of the names for the old guard to keep a keen eye\u00a0on. A first-time Chelsea designer, he made an inventive sculptural design for the Royal Bank of Canada Waterscape Garden showing how natural water-management features can be incorporated into the garden, with geometric corten-steel walkways cantilevered over channels and filtration beds which direct water through the garden at different speeds. The planting features a\u00a0high proportion of native species common to watery landscapes and wet woodland, including alder, sedge (Carex pendula), wood rush (Luzula sylvatica) and purple meadowsweet (Filipendula purpurea). Brothers Harry and David Rich (26\u00a0and 23 years old, respectively) made their first Chelsea Show garden in the Artisan Gardens section last year, for which they won a gold medal. This year their Night Sky Garden sees them moving to Main Avenue and exploring themes that relate to the night sky, drawing attention to the prevalence of light pollution. Once again they promise accomplished naturalistic planting in starlight shades of whites, blues and purples featuring a combination of British natives and ornamentals including angelica, aquilegia, astrantia, foxglove, iris, maple, birch and pears. British vernacular hard landscaping of dry-stone walls and boulders will be juxtaposed with steel-edged moon-reflecting pools and a grassy bowl offering up places to stargaze. This conjunction of the natural and the modern, the rough and the sharp, the wild and the cultivated looks to be a key theme in many of the younger designers&apos; gardens this year. Another name to watch is 28-year-old Sophie Walker, who won the People&apos;s Choice Award at last year&apos;s Hampton Court Flower Show. She is exhibiting here for the first time, in the Fresh Gardens section with her Cave Pavilion. Produced in association with the Garden Museum to raise awareness for the museum&apos;s new extension fund, it features a\u00a0Perspex pavilion, a 21st-century take on the Wardian case, the terraria used in the 19th-century to transport plants from their native habitats. The planting, designed to emulate a dreamlike jungle Eden, is composed of plants supplied by Cr\u00fbg Farm Plants, whose owners, Bleddyn and Sue Wynn-Jones, are famed for their plant collecting from the wild all over the Far East and beyond. It is the first garden at the show where the plants are fully traceable, each having its own collection number, and is designed to raise awareness of international plant conservation.     In with the new: Chelsea is the place at which to find the latest introductions, like this Lilium martagon 'Claude Shride'. Photograph: Alamy    As well as selections of some of their favoured daphniphyllum and schefflera, there will be a\u00a0range of maples hardy across a range of temperatures, including Acer campbellii var campbellii; the Vietnamese A heptaphlebium with bronze foliage; A\u00a0takesimense from Korea, which is cold-hardy and has spectacular autumn colour, and one genus completely new to cultivation, Uocodendron whartonii, which the Wynn-Joneses discovered in Taiwan in 2003. I will definitely be making my way here, for there is always something new and garden worthy from this remarkable nursery. Another theme explored by a\u00a0number of gardens is the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War. Matthew Keightley, 29, is another first-time Chelsea designer who looks to be demonstrating a clear and simple vision in his design for the Help for Heroes garden, inspired by the experiences of his brother&apos;s tours to Afghanistan. The ethos of Help for Heroes to inspire, enable and support wounded soldiers during their recovery translates into a\u00a0garden that appears calm, reflective and therapeutic. Again the design plays with a progression from wild and rough to structured and cultivated, and the use of repeated granite blocks, both rough and finished, among abundant cool green planting has strength and humility. In tune with the show&apos;s increasing awareness of sustainability, the garden will be relocated to the grounds of Help for Heroes in Essex after Chelsea is over. I say it every year, but with the intense media focus on the show gardens, it is easy to overlook the Grand Pavilion. I actually spend most of my time here and never quite feel as though I have seen everything. I&apos;m always niggled by the feeling that I have missed something amazing. The old faithfuls are here every year, but rather than feeling jaded at the familiar collections of plants, I never cease to be inspired by the displays and encouraged to try new plants. This year I am particularly looking for plants for a shady garden planted in gothic shades of green and black. Bulb specialist Jacques Amand has excellent collections of unusual and exotic woodlanders, and I am hoping to get a\u00a0clutch of Asarum maximum, Paris polyphylla and Arisaema concinnum, which is one of the easiest to grow. I have also got into the habit of placing my autumn bulb orders at the show, and it is here that I have often seen new introductions which have since become regular features in my planting plans. One such is Lilium martagon &quot;Claude Shride&quot;, available from Bloms Bulbs and Jacques Amand \u2013 the latter also stocks varieties in a range of unusual oranges and caramels, such as L\u00a0&quot;Orange Marmalade&quot;. I will also be looking to increase a\u00a0collection of cool-grown houseplants for a client, and so will head to Dibleys for its unsurpassed range of streptocarpus and foliage begonias. And from McBean&apos;s I hope to add to a collection of cymbidium orchids, with C lowianum &quot;Concolor&quot; and C tracyanum. At last year&apos;s show I was about to leave when I caught sight of Erythronium &quot;Susannah&quot; on the Harveys Garden Plants stand. It is supposed to be a great improvement on E &quot;Pagoda&quot;, and I immediately placed an order for 12, which are now doing very well in the studio garden. There is no time like the present for following through on orders that can otherwise end up as undecipherable scribbles in your notebook. If you place your orders now, when the bulbs and plants arrive in the autumn it will be a\u00a0delightful reminder of a show that takes place on the cusp of summer, and it will offer encouragement for next year&apos;s growing season before the winter descends once more."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/19/us-accusations-chinese-hacking-eight-years", "publicationDate": "2014-05-19T19:04:00Z", "tags": ["Hacking", "China", "Cyberwar", "Espionage", "Data and computer security", "Internet", "Technology"], "sentences": ["In February, it claimed that hackers in China had stolen information from oil companies in the US, Greece, Taiwan and Kazakhstan about bidding, financing and operations relating to oil fields."], "title": "US accusations of Chinese hacking point to eight-year spying campaign", "article": "The US Department of Justice indictment against a number of alleged Chinese military hackers goes back a long way, to 2006, and raises the question: why did it take them so long to take action? In February 2013, a US security company called Mandiant released a report which said the Chinese army had launched hundreds of cyber-attacks against western companies and defence groups. It said that the attacks emanated from a building that housed a group called Unit 61398 \u2013the same number that appears in the DOJ indictment. If the DOJ indictments are correct, then Mandiant&apos;s report appears to have been accurate in its description of what was happening. But that&apos;s worrying, too: it described a decade-long series of attacks on US infrastructure, gave precise details, and even the location of the building from which it reckoned the attacks were being made.  If Mandiant, a private company, can come up with that sort of detail, what exactly has the US government been doing, with what must be better access to information? The DOJ indictment says that the investigation was carried out by the FBI \u2013 though it is hard not to think that there must have been some evidence supplied by other agencies such as the National Security Agency (NSA). It&apos;s not as though the US government and its spy agencies have been unaware of the ambitions of what are believed to be Chinese state-sponsored hackers. In 2006, the new indictment alleges, Huang Zhenyu began &quot;to perform programming work for SOE-2, including the creation of a \u201csecret\u201d database designed to hold corporate &apos;intelligence&apos; about the iron and steel industries, including information about American companies.&quot; But 2006 was notable for other events in the hacking realm. The US Pentagon and UK secret services had noticed Chinese computers accessing data on the Pentagon and the House of Commons, in an attack codenamed &quot;Titan Rain&quot;, of which a specialist said the people behind it were &quot;very clever programmers&quot;. Titan Rain was only the start. According to security experts, state-sponsored individuals in China were hacking into systems belonging to all the biggest factories and companies, seeking industrial data and intellectual property. The difficulty with confirming the stories was that the companies were rarely willing to be named, and even if they were, they declined to discuss what might have been copied and spirited away. In August 2010, the security company McAfee said that it had found evidence of a five-year hacking campaign it called &quot;Shady Rat&quot; targeting more than 70 government institutions, corporations and thinktanks. In February, it claimed that hackers in China had stolen information from oil companies in the US, Greece, Taiwan and Kazakhstan about bidding, financing and operations relating to oil fields. In November 2011, allegations surfaced from the security company Symantec that Chinese hackers had targeted about 50 chemical- and military-linked companies between July and September 2010. It said &quot;multiple&quot; Fortune 100 companies were targeted \u2013 but, typically, was not allowed to name them.  The war of words between China and the US intensified; China has repeatedly insisted that hacking attacks are transnational, and the suggestion that just because a computer accesses another from China, that doesn&apos;t mean that the original attack comes from China, or that it is state-sponsored. But in early 2013, after Facebook, Twitter, the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal all said that they had been the targets of &quot;highly sophisticated&quot; attacks \u2013 in some cases focussing on correspondents writing about China \u2013 the temperature rose. (Google, the obvious big name missing from that set, had already suffered its own China-based hacking attack in December 2009; those hackers accessed its email system and tried to gain access to master passwords across the system. Google has never made clear quite how far they got, and it does not appear in the DOJ indictment as a cited victim.) The DoJ indictment names Westinghouse Electric, SolarWorld, US Steel, Allegheny Technologies, and the US Service Workers union as victims of the hacking.  But China is not the only participant in state-sponsored hacking. As the Snowden revelations have made abundantly clear, the US and UK are active participants in the subversion of internet systems; the Stuxnet virus, which affected Iran&apos;s nuclear reprocessing facility, and the Flame virus, which used &quot;world-class&quot; cryptography methods, were both reckoned to have been the work of the US and at least one other nation. The outstanding question is how the US will make the indictment enforceable. There is no extradition treaty between the US and China that would allow one of China&apos;s citizens to be remitted to the US for trial. Instead, the DoJ action may have opened a new form of cold war in which the two governments accuse each other of actions, which are denied, while both continue carrying them out against each other, and many more.

There have been a spate of collisions between the two nations&apos; ships \u2013 until now without loss of any vessels \u2013 after a long-running territorial row reignited earlier this month when China towed an oil rig into disputed waters, sparking mob violence in Vietnam that led to several deaths. &quot;A Vietnamese boat from the central city of Da Nang was deliberately encircled by 40 fishing vessels from China before it was attacked by a Chinese ship,&quot; the head of the coastguard, Nguyen Quang Dam, told Reuters by telephone on Tuesday. Other Vietnamese fishing boats rescued the ten crew members in the incident the previous day, officials said. But China&apos;s state news agency Xinhua said the vessel overturned after &quot;harassing and colliding with&quot; a Chinese vessel. China&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang blamed Vietnam for &quot;forcefully disrupting China&apos;s normal operations and its dangerous actions on the seas&quot;, urging it to halt &quot;disruptive and damaging&quot; activities. Experts have warned such incidents could spiral out of control, and the latest incident echoed clashes earlier this month when Vietnam issued video footage showing Chinese boats crashing into and firing water cannons at vessels trying to stop the drilling platform being put into place, while China accused Vietnamese ships of targeting their craft. In Vietnam, angry protestors then attacked and set fire to mostly Taiwanese factories they wrongly believed were run by mainland Chinese firms, killing at least four workers. China claims almost all of the South China Sea, which boasts rich energy resources. The complex, overlapping disputes also involve the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. Monday&apos;s incident took place 17 nautical miles from the rig, owned by the state-run China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC) Group, which is located off the Paracel or Xisha islands. It is roughly 150 miles (240km) off the Vietnamese coast and 206 miles (330km) from China&apos;s southern Hainan island. Ian Storey, of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, said there had been previous violent clashes such as the incident in which Chinese naval officers shot dead Vietnamese citizens in the Gulf of Tonkin in 2005, saying they were defending Chinese fishermen. But he added: &quot;It does underscore how dangerous the situation is. &quot;I don&apos;t think either side wants to push this into a military confrontation: China because of the reputational costs, and Vietnam because they know the Chinese military is much more powerful. That said, this is precisely the kind of incident that could trigger an escalation of the dispute which might be difficult to contain.&quot; Storey said China had indicated the rig would be in place until August, and would presumably withdraw it then \u2013 not least because of the high cost of the operation. &quot;This is not a commercial operation; they are sending a political statement [and] a very costly statement; I&apos;ve seen estimates that it costs $300,000 a day to keep the oil rig on site, plus the costs of other ships,&quot; he said. &quot;In the meantime, Vietnam is seriously looking at a legal challenge to the oil rig&apos;s presence.&quot; The Philippines has already launched a legal case against China. Storey said that if Vietnam did so, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea could issue a preliminary ruling that the rig should cease operation in a matter of weeks. But he added: &quot;My guess is that China would simply ignore it and say ITLOS has no jurisdiction.&quot; He said China was sending a message it had a right to resources and was prepared to share them, but that Vietnam and the Philippines should desist from unilaterally developing them. &quot;The other claimants are not prepared to do that, because under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea they have a strong claim to exclusive rights. Why share something that belongs to you already?&quot; Hong Nong, from China&apos;s National Institute for South China Sea Studies, said Vietnam had overreacted. &quot;Among the six parties to the dispute, China is the only one to have had no oil rig in the South China Sea. China has shown self-restraint,&quot; he said. &quot;In the past 10 years, China has been working on the preparation of an oil rig. Vietnam should have known that. They kept silent, and accepted it.&quot; Hong said that the tensions were unlikely to lead to military conflict, adding: &quot;The best way to resolve the problem is for the two countries to go back to the negotiation table, avoid the maritime collisions, and especially avoid casualties.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/28/self-driving-cars-google-success", "publicationDate": "2014-05-28T13:32:24Z", "tags": ["Self-driving cars", "Technology", "Automotive industry", "Google", "Business", "Technology sector", "Mapping technologies", "Internet", "Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars", "Environment"], "sentences": ["Its normal maps of the world have been around for the better part of a decade, and Street View, which requires driving physical cars through every road to be mapped, now covers 48 countries, including almost all of North America, Europe, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, Japan and Taiwan."], "title": "Self-driving cars face a long and winding road to success | Alex Hern", "article": "Google&apos;s first purpose-built self-driving car has arrived. The dinky two-seater looks like a cross between a Smart Car and a Nissan Micra, has no steering wheel, accelerator or brakes, and just two physical controls: &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;go&quot;. It&apos;s been a long time coming, and there&apos;s a lot more work for the company to do in the future. But right now, Google walks a knife-edge between over- and under-promising. Its cars could change the world \u2013 if anyone lets them. But there&apos;s also a certain sleight of hand involved in what it has shown off so far. Are we nearly there yet? The immediate problems for Google remain technical. It has reached the stage where its car can drive through the streets surrounding its headquarters in Mountain View, California, without any human intervention. But it&apos;s not just because of secrecy that it hasn&apos;t gone any further than that. Google&apos;s cars use an array of sensors to map the world around them in real-time. On the roof, a spinning laser creates a 3D model of every major object surrounding it, be they fellow road users or potential hazards such as pedestrians and cyclists. Cameras on the front and sides supplement that model by looking out for important visual information such as road signs or traffic lights. But the car can&apos;t gather quite enough information in real time for it to be safe. Instead, as the Atlantic&apos;s Alexis Madrigal explains, the company relies on ultra-precise maps of the area to help give it the information it needs. &quot;They&apos;re probably best thought of as ultra-precise digitisations of the physical world, all the way down to tiny details like the position and height of every single curb,&quot; Madrigal writes. &quot;A normal digital map would show a road intersection; these maps [for the self=-driving car] would have a precision measured in inches.&quot; With that model in place, all the car has to do is use its sensors to work out what&apos;s changed since then, comparing the real world to the model stored in its system. But Google has mapped a grand total of 2,000 road miles to the precision required by its cars. California has over 170,000 miles of public road (PDF) and at least twice that if you include each lane as a separate &quot;road&quot;. The UK alone has around 250,000 miles of road, and the firm hasn&apos;t even started here. Laws and customs But mapping the world is a project that Google&apos;s done before \u2013 twice. Its normal maps of the world have been around for the better part of a decade, and Street View, which requires driving physical cars through every road to be mapped, now covers 48 countries, including almost all of North America, Europe, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, Japan and Taiwan.  Nor has it stopped; the mapping continues every day, all over the world, because streets and roads keep changing. What it needs to do is capture that data in fine-grained detail good enough for its cars. How long that will take isn&apos;t known. The far trickier problem ahead is dealing with the changing social, political, and legal norms around driving. Take the question Google&apos;s tackling right now: If a self-driving car breaks the law, who is at fault: the &quot;driver&quot;, or the manufacturer? At the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), Google has spent the past few months trying to argue that the fault should lie with the manufacturer. &quot;What we&apos;ve been saying to the folks in the DMV, even in public session, for unmanned vehicles, we think the ticket should go to the company. Because the decisions are not being made by the individual,&quot; said the safety director of the self-driving car programme. As for whether the car is even legal at all, the project&apos;s lead, Chris Urmson, argues that the law, in California at least, is already clear: &quot;The law that was passed almost a year and a half ago made it quite clear that effectively driverless operation of vehicles was permitted in California and in general we believe that\u2019s true across much of the US. What will happen in the not-too-distant future is the California DMV will issue regulations about the operation of self-driving vehicles, and I believe in the law there will be a a clause requiring a six-month notification period before vehicles without drivers are allowed on the road.&quot; Trolley problems But more difficult questions will inevitably arise; and how Google answers them will shape the progression of the technology. Take a no-win situation for any driver: two children run out from behind a parked van, meaning there&apos;s no visible cue of their approach, and there isn&apos;t enough distance to brake. At the same time, their mother runs (from behind a van too) into the road on the other side - she saw the danger. You can swerve and hit the mother, or carry on and hit the children. What do you do? Such problems, and a class of others like it, are known in philosophy as &quot;trolley problems&quot;. With tweaks, they can be used to draw out contradictions and paradoxes in our innate understanding of ethics, underscoring the fact that there seems to be no general answer to ethical problems which leaves everyone happy. And yet Google has to decide on an answer anyway. When a driver is faced with such decisions, we free them of responsibility whichever outcome they choose; the human mind just can&apos;t be expected to make difficult ethical decisions on a split-second basis. But Google isn&apos;t working on a split-second basis. As Patrick Lin, the director of the Ethics &amp; Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State University, wrote in Wired: &quot;while human drivers may be forgiven for making a poor split-second reaction \u2013 for instance, crashing into a Pinto that\u2019s prone to explode, instead of a more stable object \u2013 robot cars won\u2019t enjoy that freedom. Programmers have all the time in the world to get it right. It\u2019s the difference between premeditated murder and involuntary manslaughter.&quot; These are questions that need answers. Without them, the first time a self-driving car is involved in a fatal collision \u2013 which is inevitable, no matter how much safer they are in aggregate than human-driven cars \u2013 the response could derail the whole project. Over-deliver And that would be unacceptable. Because a world where we&apos;ve fully cracked the problems of self-driving cars would be significantly better than our own, and not just in the obvious ways. The most immediate change would be safety. Google&apos;s cars have so far been involved in two incidents, neither of which was the fault of the software (one was rear-ended by a human driver; the other crashed while being driven manually). They haven&apos;t yet been driven enough miles to be fully certified as safer than humans \u2013 on average in the UK there is one &quot;slight casualty&quot; for every 1.7m miles driven (and you have to drive six times further per road death). Google&apos;s cars have only clocked 700,000. Even so, a car which can&apos;t be driven drunk, which can&apos;t speed, and can&apos;t get distracted presents immense possibilities for the future. But the bigger changes will come if the such cars overturn our entire idea of what &quot;driving&quot; is. For instance, a car that needs no driver is also, in short order, a car that needs no occupants at all. It can drop you off at your destination, then head off to find a parking space, even if that&apos;s a mile out of town; or it can act as a simple courier, taking a package from A to B without needing to bring a person along for the ride. In that world, though, why does anyone need to own a car at all? Google&apos;s Urmson touches on some of the possibilities in his interview with Recode&apos;s Liz Gannes: &quot;My vision for this is eventually these vehicles will be shared, and it may be within a family, or it may be within a community, and that will result in less vehicles on the road, but they\u2019ll be used much more efficiently, and that\u2019s good for everyone.&quot; That would make the taxi provider Uber or car-sharing scheme Zipcar look like relics from the stone age. But it also requires courage from the trailblazers. Google isn&apos;t the only company working on self-driving cars: Volvo&apos;s 2014 model of its XC90 SUV can steer itself round corners, park at the tap of a button and automatically brake to avoid hitting pedestrians. But you can be certain that Vovlo isn&apos;t out to build a world where most people don&apos;t own a personal car. The easy way out would be to side with Elon Musk, and end up pushing for a system that is mostly the same as what we already have, because &quot;it&apos;s incredibly hard to get the last few percent&quot;. That would leave us still requiring driving tests, competent individuals behind the &quot;wheel&quot;, car parks, and all the rest. The alternative would be world-changing. \u2022 How does Google&apos;s self-driving car work \u2013 and when can we drive one?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/jun/02/google-balloon-internet", "publicationDate": "2014-06-02T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "sentences": ["Notebook vendors demanding price cuts &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Notebook vendors have asked ODMs and component makers to lower quotes in an attempt to maintain profitability due to stagnant demand, according to Taiwan-based supply chain makers."], "title": "Boot up: Google's lost balloon, Apple's IoT plans and Moto X factory shuts", "article": "A burst of 12 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Google&apos;s Loon balloon descended too soon &gt;&gt; Yakima Herald Republic Kate Prengaman:   Google this: Where did one of the Internet giant&apos;s high-tech, high-atmosphere balloons land?

Curved screens make our brains light up with pleasure &gt;&gt; New Scientist Peter Nowak:   THE future looks curvy. A spate of gadgets sporting concave displays has already been launched, and the big manufacturers will soon be hurling yet more TVs and smartphones with curved screens on to the shelves. Rumours continue to swirl that even Apple&apos;s forthcoming iPhone 6 will bend to the craze later this year. There&apos;s more to the trend than just a novel shape, though. It may be tapping into a deep-seated desire to get away from the hard corners and rectangles that have defined our appliances for decades. The craze for curves is also fueling a search for materials and manufacturing techniques that will help companies exploit it to the full. &quot;The first adjective used by people to describe curves is &apos;soft&apos;,&quot; says Oshin Vartanian, a neuroscientist at the University of Toronto, Canada. &quot;The story about curvature is a real story about emotion in the brain.&quot;  Welcome to &quot;neuroasethetics&quot; - which involves fMRI among other methods.

Apple&apos;s IoT &apos;Good Housekeeping&apos; Label: MFi &gt;&gt; EE Times Junko Yoshida:   Expect Apple to beat Google to the punch by unveiling its Internet of Things (IoT) strategy on its home front at Apple&apos;s Worldwide Developer Conference next week in San Francisco. Apple will lay out a plan to connect a plethora of IoT devices -- light bulbs, thermostats, door locks, washing machines, refrigerators -- with iPhone. Apple&apos;s iPhone will serve as a screen to set up each of these IoT devices (since some of them are physically too small to have a screen of their own) and automatically connect them to the home network, after which the iPhone becomes the smart home&apos;s all-purpose remote control. EE Times has learned that the key to its execution is a wireless chip - WiFi, Bluetooth, or Zigbee - and an MCU, combined with a piece of software that allows each IoT device to be certified as an MFi (Made For iPhone/iPad/iPod) device. The beauty of the scheme is twofold. First, it&apos;s simple.  Simple? That&apos;s going to disappoint a lot of bloggers. Google&apos;s Motorola Mobility to close factory in Texas &gt;&gt; WSJ  Motorola, which Google plans to sell, opened the factory in May 2013. A few months later, Dennis Woodside, the handset unit&apos;s chief executive at the time, said it would challenge conventional wisdom that manufacturing in the U.S. is too expensive. At its peak late last year, the plant employed as many as 3,800 people, most on behalf of contract manufacturer Flextronics International. Today, the factory employs about 700 workers who assemble high-end Moto X smartphones that are sold in the US, a Motorola spokesman said. Market researcher Strategy Analytics said Motorola sold 900,000 Moto X smartphones world-wide in the first quarter. By comparison, Apple sold 26 million units of its newest iPhone 5S in the same period. &quot;What we found was that the North American market was exceptionally tough,&quot; Motorola President Rick Osterloh said in an interview. \u2026Late last year, Motorola began pursuing a new &quot;value&quot; strategy to sell smartphones at lower prices than rivals, a strategy Mr. Osterloh said will continue. The smaller profit margins may help Motorola regain market share, though they put more pressure on the company to control costs.  Be interesting to see how Lenovo views the &quot;value&quot; strategy. (Subscription required for full story.) Are GPUs about to enter IT&apos;s mainstream? IT should watch carefully &gt;&gt; Freeform Comment  Until relatively recently most in IT looked upon Graphics Processing Units (GPUs[1]) as specialty technology with dozens or hundreds of cores optimized to run complex mathematical modelling and analysis, numerically intense calculations or for driving sophisticated graphics and rendering. In effect GPUs were for where conventional processors did not have the horsepower to solve specific types of &apos;scientific&apos; problems that could exploit parallel processing. The implicit specialisation that this represented is, however, changing. GPUs are becoming general purpose, with so-called GPGPUs, and these are likely to enter IT&apos;s mainstream because of three separate yet coincidental developments which complement each other.

That said, other devices are slowly gaining popularity and eating into the Windows Phone device market share that is commanded by the Lumia 520. About 33.7% of all Windows Phone devices out in public right now are the Lumia 520, followed by the Lumia 625 in the number two position with 6.7% and the Lumia 920 in third with 6.2%. The surprise is the Lumia 521 (exclusive to T-Mobile here in the United States) jumping seven spots to take the number four position with 6.0%.  That&apos;s a huge gulf - the Lumia 520 (the low-end phone) has been Nokia&apos;s salvation (such as it is). &quot;Others&quot; - as in other manufacturers - make up 21.9%. Based on total Lumia shipments since 2010, that suggests there are a maximum of 65m Windows Phone in use.

The concept works by expanding your fingers on an existing app icon to get a Block with information like weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and music controls. You can then pinch it back to a normal icon, or place it permanently alongside other icons on the home screen. [Designer Jay] Machalani has created three sizes: iPhone, iPad in portrait, and iPad in landscape orientation. You can have multiple Blocks on a home screen, and the iPad versions leverage the additional space on a tablet display.  Widgets, done in a Windows Phone-style way.  BEA 2014: can anyone compete with Amazon? &gt;&gt; Publishers Weekly  As the Amazon-Hachette showdown continues to dominate talk at BookExpo America this week, many industry insiders are wondering whether any retail player can challenge Amazon&apos;s dominance. Research conducted in March by the Codex Group found that in the month Amazon&apos;s share of new book unit purchases was 41%, dominating 65% of all online new book units, print and digital. The company achieved that percentage by not only being the largest channel for e-books, where it had a 67% market share in March, but also by having a commanding slice of the sale of print books online, where its share in March was estimated at 64%. Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble are the only two book outlets that have a meaningful share of both the e-book and print markets, assets that are becoming increasingly important as book buyers turn more and more to online channels to purchase books. According to the newest figures from Nielsen Market Research, online outlets accounted for 41% of book purchases in 2013, while bookstore chains accounted for 22%.  Google, Bing: time to junk these parasitic download sites &gt;&gt; Tim Anderson&apos;s ITWriting Anderson had to help out a friend whose PC became infested with adware after they downloaded what they thought was iTunes - via an advert on Google.

Well, the warning signs may be obvious to those of us in the trade, but frankly it is not that unreasonable to go to your trusted search engine, type in iTunes, and click the download link. The blame is with Google (and Bing) for taking money from these advertisers whose aim is to get to you download their intrusive ad-laden extras.

The anniversary has been preceded by scores of detentions, with others placed under house arrest. Some detainees have been charged with offences carrying prison terms of several years for holding a private memorial gathering. Google services have been disrupted and police have warned some foreign journalists they face unspecified consequences for covering sensitive issues. &quot;We are seeing much harsher measures taken against a far broader swath of people this year. One question is whether, come Thursday morning, a lot of those people are let go,&quot; said Sophie Richardson, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, are believed to have died when troops opened fire late on 3 June 1989. Most of the victims were ordinary workers killed around the city (pdf), reflecting the mass support that the student-led protests had drawn. But the official verdict dismissed the events as a counter-revolutionary riot. &quot;The Chinese government long ago reached a conclusion about the political turmoil at the end of the 1980s,&quot; foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a daily news briefing on Tuesday. &quot;In the last three decades and more of reform and opening up, China&apos;s enormous achievements in social and economic development have received worldwide attention. The building of democracy and the rule of law have continued to be perfected.&quot; Asked about recent detentions, he added: &quot;In China there are only law breakers; there are no so-called dissidents.&quot; After years of enforced silence, many young people have little idea if any of what took place. Others have come to believe that the crackdown was inevitable or even necessary for the sake of stability. Here, three protesters and an expert on the split within the Communist party discuss how the massacre has shaped today&apos;s China, the alternative courses that the country might have taken, and the prospects for political reform.     Shen Tong: 'The night before they began, the protests were impossible; the morning after, they were inevitable.' Photograph: Anna Schori    Shen Tong, a student leader, now lives in the US. He is a partner in investment firm SOSVentures and founder of its accelerator programme FoodX  There were three choices in 1989: first, to continue in the same mould, with half-hearted reform. The second has been common in the last 25 years: street protests following mostly non-violent principles and challenging government power and winning, like the colour revolutions and Arab spring. I don&apos;t think any society has had such a widespread and large-scale protest that only asked for reform, an opportunity for negotiation and a peaceful outcome. There was such a mandate from the general public. There was a very obvious and clear candidate to lead reform \u2013 Zhao Ziyang [then general secretary of the party]. Perhaps it is naive to think so, but there could have been genuine and top-down change in response to this overwhelming jolt. The third outcome was the route China has actually taken. A smaller part of the government and party usurped power and put Zhao under house arrest. The government used overwhelming, shocking force \u2013 and fear works. The limitation in my thinking then \u2013 still by and large shared by the Chinese liberal intelligentsia today \u2013 was the idea that somehow if we were even more moderate and careful to not harm leaders&apos; sensitivities and egos we could not only minimise the inevitable crackdown, but somehow China would be better off.  In recent years I have realised how naive and wrong I was. More aggressive and confrontational tactics have led to peaceful transformations.  If Chinese Communist history is any guide, no matter how careful we were, no matter how &apos;well-behaved&apos;, the crackdown was inevitable. If we&apos;d asked for a little bit more. if we&apos;d asked for regime change \u2013 China would have been very different. We had generals warning the government not to open fire. When another opportunity comes about, will protests be so organised and peaceful? It is when; there&apos;s no if; there&apos;s a moral direction in history. The night before they began, the protests were impossible; the morning after, they were inevitable.  The overall feeling was a celebration. It&apos;s a positive legacy: it shows China deserves that change and may very well pull it off again. We have forgotten how beautiful it was because the ending was so overwhelmingly tragic.      Wang Chaohua, who was involved in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests photographed near her home in north London. Photograph: Richard Saker    Wang Chaohua was one of the 21 &quot;most wanted&quot; student leaders sought by authorities. She fled into exile after months in hiding and is a visiting lecturer at UCLA.  Political liberalisation had already slowed down. That logic simply became crystallised by the Tiananmen crackdown. But if there had not been the military crackdown, even if some people were persecuted afterwards, at least the form of mass protest would retain some legitimacy.  Over time, the public space for activism became narrower and narrower in terms of the control of political discourse. You can do things, but you can&apos;t explain them in political terms. Now anybody, even staying at home, could &apos;pose a threat to public order&apos;. Another thing that happened in 1989 was a complete shift of attention. Reforms started from the countryside [but] the government turned its attention to the cities to keep them stable. Whenever it saw signs the city folks felt discontent it rushed to pacify them. The countryside has become the target of exploitation.  I do see hope. [While some members of] the younger generation say that China needed stability in 1989, they also lament the fact college students were so much more idealistic &apos;not like us today&apos;. On the negative side, the regime has become more conscious of the power in its hands. Economic development has made officials see how easy it is to be corrupt. The regime has become less and less efficient and is more often using the police force.  I see these two sides as making it more likely than it was in 2000 that China will have some really crushing moment in the next five or 10 years. I don&apos;t think the party can reform itself. It has become such an entangled web of interests; you can&apos;t get it working no matter how great a leader is parachuted in at the top. So it would be more likely that a sudden incident or economic crisis would cause a catastrophic moment. The outcome of that is very difficult to predict. We can&apos;t be sure it would be a bright or satisfying one, leading to a better political future.      Rowena He joined protests in Guangzhou as a schoolgirl.  Photograph: The Guardian    Rowena He joined protests in Guangzhou as a schoolgirl. She is now a lecturer at Harvard and author of Tiananmen Exiles: Voices of the Struggle   Tiananmen didn&apos;t end in 1989. Chinese society is struggling with an open, unhealed wound. Let&apos;s forget about the big words and theories and get down to human issues: when people&apos;s children are killed, are they able to mourn for them? Those are very basic rights that every parent in the world deserves. History was erased and twisted by those in power. It&apos;s not just about twisting the facts of what happened; it&apos;s the values they twisted. Even if students know about the crackdown, they say, that&apos;s okay. When the regime ordered the army to fire on people in the name of national pride and economic development, it sent the message that anything can be done to become rich.  Over the years the policy has led to higher average living standards, a booming economy, and a more predominant place for China in the world \u2013 but has also engendered enormous inequality, massive corruption, growing environmental problems and profound popular cynicism, massive expenditure on stability maintenance and now a sense of belligerence on the international stage. If you play the game you have social status and a good life. Chinese intellectuals started to develop this cynicism and reluctance to be critical and enthusiastically discuss social and political issues. We were idealistic; we had been exposed to all those revolutionary stories. People saw it as their responsibility to help improve the country. If another Tiananmen happened now it would not be out of idealism and passion, but grievances and anger.  China lost a golden opportunity for the Communist party to reform itself and start looking to Taiwan&apos;s example: Let people have free speech and press and release political prisoners and in this way civil society will be able to develop. I think history is on our side, but China has to face its past in order to have a future.      Andrew Nathan: 'The alternative to a crackdown was there.' Photograph: The Guardian    Andrew Nathan is editor of the Tiananmen Papers, a compilation of leaked materials from 1989, and an expert on elite Chinese politics at Columbia University   I think Li Peng [then China&apos;s premier] was right that had they agreed to dialogue with the students on authentic grounds, giving some real power to civil society, it would have changed the form of rule. But they could have done that \u2013 and Zhao Ziyang wanted to do it, and had quite a bit of support in the leadership and party.  The alternative to a crackdown was there. Even Deng Xiaoping saw the good sense of the proposal until Li Peng came to him and said &apos;the students are calling for your head&apos;. On the student side, there were always people saying: &apos;We&apos;ve made the point, let&apos;s withdraw.&apos; When we look back at 1978 [when reform and opening began] to 1989, it was a very ambiguous, zig-zagging period with respect to the political model. Deng Xiaoping did not have a blueprint. The openness to experimentation really ended with the crisis in 1989. It&apos;s the kind of system that has a lot of problems: it produces abuse of power; has difficulty satisfying civil society; creates a middle class which is pretty conservative because it has benefited from economic reform, but also has a lot of expectations and demands of the government: efficiency, services, probity.  Had they moved to a political model that had more transparency, more independent rule of law, more independent media, more chances for civil society to supervise, I believe China would still have had economic growth \u2013 it was a period of the growth of Asia and the globalised trading economy \u2013 but a more healthy form. I think China would be more stable.  When we talk about China becoming a democracy, it&apos;s confusing because the term is so incredibly broad. I have never thought China would adopt the US constitution.  The Chinese constitution has the National People&apos;s Congress [the largely rubber-stamp parliament], a head of state, the state council, a chapter on citizens&apos; rights and duties. All they have to do is get rid of the piece that says this is conditional on total obedience to the Communist party. Would China have achieved that by now [without the crackdown]? I think, perhaps. Li Peng had a good point: once you start to open this up it&apos;s going to grow very fast.

But while the government would like to erase all memories of the crackdown, tens of thousands are expected to gather at a candlelit vigil to mourn the dead in Hong Kong \u2013 allowed to hold such assemblies, unlike people on the mainland, under the greater freedom permitted in the region. Organisers have said they expect record attendance, with perhaps 150,000 or more people gathering. Another, smaller vigil is expected in Taiwan. The Taiwanese president, Ma Ying-jeou, described the crackdown as &quot;an enormous historical wound&quot; and said China had to redress the wrongs. Security has been tightened significantly at the square in recent weeks, in part following terrorist attacks in China. On Wednesday tourists faced long queues at scanners and had their bags searched before they were allowed in, with most foreigners having their passports checked. Uniformed police patrolled on Segways (two-wheeled electric vehicles) and with dogs, while plainclothes officers squatted and waited or strolled about the square. Some foreign media were ordered to leave and others were prevented from entering. A reporter for Hong Kong&apos;s South China Morning Post tweeted that the newspaper&apos;s account on the Chinese microblog service Weibo had been suspended. It has run extensive coverage of the anniversary. Several users of LinkedIn, one of the few foreign social media services not blocked in China, complained that it had censored posts about the anniversary or related detentions. The posts appear to have been blocked to users in China rather than deleted. The company&apos;s press office had not responded to queries from the Guardian at time of writing, but a spokesman told the Wall Street Journal that while it strongly supported freedom of expression: &quot;It&apos;s clear to us that in order to create value for our members in China and around the world, we will need to implement the Chinese government&apos;s restrictions on content, when and to the extent required.&quot; Maya Wang, of Human Rights Watch, said this year&apos;s crackdown before the anniversary had been notably harsher than usual, with more people affected and more detained by police rather than placed under house arrest. She added: &quot;The government fears any acknowledgement or discussion of the incident would undermine the legitimacy of their version of events. &quot;Most people in China today don&apos;t want to talk about Tiananmen, believe in the official verdict or don&apos;t know about it \u2013 generally there&apos;s silence except for from a small minority of activists trying to keep the memory alive. In that sense the authorities have been quite successful. &quot;But the same issues raised 25 years ago continue to dominate the grievances people raise today, such as lack of accountability and corruption.&quot; An editorial in an English language edition of the state-run populist newspaper Global Times, which often covers more sensitive material than the Chinese version, said: &quot;China has shielded relevant information in a bid to wield a positive influence on the smooth development of reform and opening up. The generation that experienced the incident has developed a deeper understanding of it through China&apos;s growth and such tragedies as the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the fall of communism in eastern Europe and the Arab spring.&quot; The article, not carried in the Chinese edition, added: &quot;The younger generation has avoided being misled by forces antagonistic to China&apos;s current political system. Chinese society has never forgotten the incident 25 years ago, but not talking about it indicates the attitude of society.&quot; Wu&apos;er Kaixi, a prominent student leader now living in exile in Taiwan, said: &quot;The Chinese government has tried their best to remove all elements of people remembering it. They have managed to keep it away from all the media and social media \u2013 but that&apos;s needed because people refuse to forget.&quot; He said the Chinese government still needed to address public discontent over issues such as rampant corruption. &quot;In 1989 they made the worst possible choice. Today I am still hopeful \u2013 but not very optimistic \u2013 the regime will realise they have already run out of options,&quot; he said. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, has expressed concern for those held in the runup to the anniversary, adding: &quot;I urge the Chinese authorities to immediately release those detained for the exercise of their human right to freedom of expression. &quot;Rather than stifle attempts to commemorate the 1989 events, the authorities should encourage and facilitate dialogue and discussion as a means of overcoming the legacy of the past.&quot; The White House urged China to account for those who had been killed, detained or gone missing in connection with the crackdown and said it honoured the memories of those who died. &quot;The United States will always speak out in support of the basic freedoms the protestors at Tiananmen Square sought, including the freedom of expression, the freedom of the press and the freedoms of association and assembly,&quot; the press secretary said.

Rany Cao, a 30-year-old participant from the mainland, told AP: &quot;The reason that I&apos;ve come here is that I want to see the sunshine of freedom. I expect to learn more about the truth of what happened 25 years ago.&quot; While organisers once feared the vigils were dwindling as time went by, they have drawn increased crowds in recent years, including many too young to recall the events of 1989. Another, smaller vigil took place in Taipei. Those in attendance included Wu&apos;er Kaixi, a prominent student leader now living in exile in Taiwan. &quot;The Chinese government has tried their best to remove all elements of people remembering it. They have managed to keep it away from all the media and social media \u2013 but that&apos;s needed because people refuse to forget,&quot; he said. He added that the Chinese government still needed to address public discontent over issues such as rampant corruption. &quot;In 1989 they made the worst possible choice. Today I am still hopeful \u2013 but not very optimistic \u2013 the regime will realise they have already run out of options,&quot; he said. The official verdict on the protests condemned the &quot;counter-revolutionary riot&quot;. But student leaders sought reform rather than to overthrow the Chinese Communist party. The protests quickly drew support from workers and even parts of the Chinese the party, drawing millions on to the streets of Beijing and other cities across China at their height.

Photograph: Henry Lin/EPA    Maya Wang, of Human Rights Watch, said more people had been affected by this year&apos;s crackdown, and more detained by police and even charged, rather than placed under house arrest. She added: &quot;The government fears any acknowledgement or discussion of the incident would undermine the legitimacy of their version of events. &quot;Most people in China today don&apos;t want to talk about Tiananmen, believe in the official verdict or don&apos;t know about it \u2013 generally there&apos;s silence except for from a small minority of activists trying to keep the memory alive. But the same issues raised 25 years ago continue to dominate the grievances people raise today.&quot; An editorial in an English language edition of the state-run populist newspaper Global Times, which often covers more sensitive material than the Chinese version, said: &quot;China has shielded relevant information in a bid to wield a positive influence on the smooth development of reform and opening up.&quot; The article, not carried in the Chinese edition, added: &quot;Chinese society has never forgotten the incident 25 years ago, but not talking about it indicates the attitude of society.&quot; The White House urged Beijing to account for those who had been killed, detained or gone missing in connection with the 1989 crackdown and said it honoured the memories of those who died. &quot;The United States will always speak out in support of the basic freedoms the protestors at Tiananmen Square sought, including the freedom of expression, the freedom of the press and the freedoms of association and assembly,&quot; the White House press secretary said. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, has expressed concern for those held in the runup to the anniversary, adding: &quot;I urge the Chinese authorities to immediately release those detained for the exercise of their human right to freedom of expression.&quot; In Dharamsala, India, the Dalai Lama offered prayers for those who died and urged China to embrace democracy. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said the Dalai Lama had &quot;ulterior motives&quot; for his remarks.

Amid all that, there&apos;s one case that&apos;s unlikely to catch much attention. It sits in the in-tray of a Bangkok administrative court, and concerns a dispute between a director and Thailand&apos;s board of film censors. The movie in question has been banned since 2012, when the censors decreed that it possessed &quot;content that causes divisiveness among the people of the nation&quot;. The director&apos;s name is Ing Kanjanavanit. The title of her film is Shakespeare Tong Tai (Shakespeare Must Die). Even by the fraught standards of Thailand&apos;s recent history, the idea of a 450-year-old poet being politically too hot to handle seems surreal. But then everything about this story is surreal: belligerent title aside, the film is a dutiful adaptation of Shakespeare&apos;s Macbeth, faithful to nearly every jot and scribble of the text (at 172 minutes, it&apos;s not for lightweights). It received 3m Thai baht (\u00a354,000) in funding from Thailand&apos;s Ministry of Culture, two years before a different branch of the same ministry decided to outlaw it. Ing has been attacked as a royalist sympathiser and a dangerous subversive, and simultaneously lauded as a selfless defender of free speech. She and I are sitting on a bench outside the campus of National Taiwan University in Taipei, where Shakespeare Must Die has just been screened. The air is heavy with traffic fumes from the evening rush hour; you could slice the humidity with a knife. The reason we&apos;ve abandoned the blissful air-con of the screening room for the bench is so that Ing can smoke. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she says, genuinely troubled. &quot;Sorry. Really, you don&apos;t mind?&quot; Slight and neat with a patient, wide gaze, Ing (who as a director goes under the name of Ing K) doesn&apos;t look like a firebrand. Born in 1959, she was sent to boarding school in Derbyshire and studied for her A-levels in Godalming, Surrey; her English has a pleasingly antiquated quality. It is easier to picture her as a smalltown university lecturer than a dangerous rabble-rouser. I run through the outlines of the case, to check I&apos;m not missing something. She smiles wanly. &quot;Two years now,&quot; she says. &quot;We have no idea when we&apos;ll get our day in court. It could be any day, it could be much longer. But when the country&apos;s like this, who cares about a movie?&quot; &apos;I use Thaksin to illustrate Shakespeare, not the other way around. I could just shout rude words on the street; plenty of people do. It&apos;d be much less trouble&apos; The project began in earnest in 2007, when Ing had finished her previous film, Polamuang Juling (Citizen Juling), a documentary about the death of a teacher assaulted by a group of Muslim women in southern Thailand. Convinced that Juling was too controversial for international festivals, she began translating Macbeth to keep her mind off things. &quot;I just wanted to have no brain left for anything else. So I went back to Shakespeare.&quot; As it happened, in 2008 Juling was selected by the Toronto festival, where the New York Times praised it as &quot;unflinchingly and achingly human&quot;. Soon after, it was accepted by Berlin. But by then Ing had become consumed by Macbeth; her partner Manit Sriwanichpoom, one of Thailand&apos;s leading photographers, who had also collaborated on Juling, produced. Together they called it Shakespeare Must Die (no relation to Paolo and Vittorio Taviani&apos;s Caesar Must Die, which came out later: eerie coincidence, she smiles). Though she wanted to translate Shakespeare&apos;s text into Thai as precisely as possible, Ing wanted to make the play contemporary. She sensed it could be a pointed analogue for her country&apos;s turbulent recent history, which had witnessed the arrival of the tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra as prime minister in 2001 (a hero to some; a corrupt dictator to others), his overthrow in 2006, and the subsequent tumultuous power struggles, capped by this latest military coup \u2013 perhaps the 12th Thailand has seen since 1932 (calculations vary). In the film, Macbeth/Dear Leader, played with porcine cunning by Pisarn Pattanapeeradej, transitions with alarming rapidity from dutiful officer to narrow-eyed megalomaniac, chillaxing in his garishly overdecorated compound. Fiona Tarini Graham&apos;s Lady M is sensual and vengeful, always on the brink; she ends her life in the palace pool, like a subtropical Ophelia.            Even if you&apos;re unversed in the intricacies of Thai politics, it is not hard to see Thaksin&apos;s shadow falling across the screenplay. That at least seems to have been the view of the censors, who decreed that it was &quot;in conflict with peaceful social order or good public morality&quot;, and demanded changes \u2013 notably objecting to its use of the colour red, associated with Thaksin&apos;s supporters. The film had been funded by an opposition-led government; by the time it came to be licensed, Thaksin&apos;s sister Yingluck was prime minister. Ing concedes she is hardly a fan of a man she accuses of a &quot;blatant and obscene lack of ethics&quot;, but rejects the accusation that the film is anti-Thaksin propaganda: her use of red, for instance, was decided long before it became associated with his redshirts. &quot;I use Thaksin to illustrate Shakespeare, not the other way around. I could just shout rude words on the street; plenty of people do. It&apos;d be much less trouble.&quot; And in fact Shakespeare Must Die is stranger and more multivalent than that, a hallucinogenic play-within-a-play in which a staged production of Macbeth drifts into dreamlike reality, then out of it again. Some scenes occur in what looks like a theatre, complete with watching audience; others are more straightforwardly naturalistic. One of the most disturbing sections occurs at the end, where Macbeth&apos;s execution bleeds into a scene resembling the notorious massacre at Thammasat University in Bangkok on 6 October 1976. The facts are disputed, but police and rightwing paramilitaries were accused of torturing and murdering at least 46 pro-democracy students, some of whom had been staging satirical theatre as part of their protests, an ominous interleaving of art and life. &quot;Macbeth ends optimistically: the bad guy dead, all that,&quot; says Ing. &quot;But in real life it&apos;s not a happy ending. The film is a kind of warning.&quot; &apos;What can you do? You just go on and on. Put one foot in front of the other&apos; If it is a warning, few have been able to attend to it. Barred from public screening in Thailand, Shakespeare Must Die has been seen only in campus settings and at a handful of festivals in Asia. Ing grinds out her cigarette. &quot;The guy from Cannes said: &apos;Why are you making such an unimaginative adaptation?&apos; If I had made Macbeth a pimp and set it in a Bangkok red-light district, Lady M as a whorehouse madam, the Witches transvestite drag queens, it would have gone everywhere.&quot; Her response to the impasse was to do what she did before: pick up a camera. Watching her partner return from meeting after fruitless meeting with the men in suits, Ing decided to come along, too \u2013 partly to keep him company, partly as legal cover. Initially she had no thought of turning the footage into a film, but as they journeyed from being denied a rating to public protests to a failed appeal, a plotline began to emerge: a shoestring Waiting for Godot with overtones of Kafka; high Shakespearean tragedy transformed into a bureaucratic comedy of errors, complete with a cast of hapless, face-saving goons. They called it Censor Must Die. It&apos;s not without laughs: on one occasion Manit is made to wait while the board urgently reviews the family film Dear Doggies 2; on another Ing is expelled to the culture ministry lobby, whereupon her camera lingers on a fatuous instructional video on the niceties of Thai etiquette. &quot;This is their mentality, so out of step with the times. It&apos;s absurd. Like Alice in Wonderland.&quot; Equally Alice in Wonderland is the fact that \u2013 presumably embarrassed by having outlawed a film co-written by Shakespeare \u2013 the authorities have allowed Censor Must Die to pass, on the basis that it depicts &quot;events that really happened&quot;. &quot;But effectively it&apos;s been banned,&quot; says Ing. &quot;They threatened to sue a cinema that put it on. What cinema wants to screen documentaries anyway?&quot; The court case is still pending; she and Manit are busily considering alternative ways to screen their work in Bangkok. And Ing has been shooting yet another documentary, this time following the anti-government protesters camped around Bangkok&apos;s Victory monument and filmed largely on her iPhone. Her working title is Bangkok Joyride. She&apos;s been working on it for seven months. A long time, I say. She shrugs helplessly: &quot;I haven&apos;t got an ending yet.&quot; Back in London, I call up Ing to check how she&apos;s doing. It&apos;s now 10 days after the military moved in. She is more optimistic than I expect: perhaps there will be a political settlement, she says. The court case is progressing. And she has her ending \u2013 to Bangkok Joyride, at least. Gatherings of more than five people are now outlawed; she was filming on the day the soldiers arrived. A conclusion of sorts. The phone line makes her sound a world away. &quot;What can you do?&quot; she says. &quot;You just go on and on. Put one foot in front of the other.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/jun/11/smart-tv-hacks", "publicationDate": "2014-06-11T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google", "Motorola"], "sentences": ["The company announced a new smartwatch/fitness band at Computex in Taiwan on Monday."], "title": "Boot up: smart TV hacks, platform churn, ZTE poaching from Motorola\u2026", "article": "A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Alarm bells ring for Internet of Things after smart TV hack &gt;&gt; SC Magazine UK  Yossef Oren and Angelos Keromytis from the Network Security Lab at Columbia University have found that the so-called Smart TV could be hacked using a cheap antenna and broadcast messages, and relies on an insecurity in the Hybrid Broadcast-Broadband Television Standard (HbbTV), which now features on millions of internet-connected TVs after being introduced two years ago. HbbTV has been adopted by more than 90% of TV set producers, according to research outfit GFK, and allows the approximate 60 broadcasters using the standard in Europe to add interactive HTML content to DVB cable, satellite or terrestrial signals. This means that viewers can use their favourite web services via TV apps, and allows advertisers to serve up relevant ads. But writing in a new research paper published this week, Oren and Keromytis have detailed that the standard is vulnerable to a &quot;large-scale exploitation technique&quot; that is &quot;remarkably difficult to detect&quot;.

Inside ZTE&apos;s human resources department, a special team is tasked with recruiting talent from BlackBerry. While the team has so far recruited fewer than 20 people, it plans to hire more, a person familiar with the situation said. Most of the new hires from BlackBerry, which include senior engineers, are currently based in Canada, but they may later move to the U.S. or China to play greater roles for ZTE, the person added. &quot;We hope the talent from BlackBerry can enhance our product security and design capability,&quot; said Adam Zeng, who became the head of ZTE&apos;s mobile device business in January  Why are people leaving Motorola to join ZTE rather than Lenovo? Acer CEO weighs in on smartwatches at Computex 2014 &gt;&gt; Androidheadlines.com  Acer&apos;s CEO Jason Chen understands that smartwatches are the future.

The Leap does some smartwatch things too, by sending and receiving texts and email messages. The device only works with Acer&apos;s Liquid Jade smartphone for now, although further Android and iOS availability is coming soon. Chen says that he doesn&apos;t know how the Liquid Leap is going to stand out from the crowded smartwatch market, though. &quot;We believe over time the market will prove itself,&quot; he said in an interview with Engadget. &quot;What we have to do is get the product [out] and see how it goes.

Honeywell&apos;s Lyric thermostat has the looks and smarts to take on Nest &gt;&gt; Engadget  The screen automatically turns on as you approach, and stays off the rest of the time, so it doesn&apos;t constantly bathe your living room in orange light.

Marginal cost of transportation: robotaxis and sprawl\u00a0repair &gt;&gt; Strong Towns Blog - Strong Towns Neil Salmond (no relation to Alex?):   Apart from the occasional highway convoy, the vision of nose-to-tail robocars is many decades out, if it ever happens at all. This new technology is not cheap, and so the asset will be sweated: robotaxis will not make just two commuting trips per day, and lie idle the rest of the time. They will not make rapid transit redundant either, for simple reasons of geometry and predictability: why wait ten minutes for a more expensive personal taxi, when you can walk to the transit stop and get the next train in two. Instead robotaxis will be offered as a fleet service. The availability of robotaxis in a community will provide two great boosts to sprawl repairers. Firstly, the cost of insurance for human-driven vehicles within city limits will rise hugely. Secondly, parking lots and travel lanes will far more easily be removed as ownership declines.

IDC&apos;s latest longer-range forecast to 2018 is also gloomy about PC prospects in emerging markets \u2013 previously the source of growth. But there&apos;s bad news for tablet makers too. IDC has slashed its forecast for future tablet sales, based on slowing replacement cycles which put them closer to PCs than smartphones. Nor is there good news for those making &quot;2-in-1&quot; devices \u2013 PCs with detachable keyboards such as Microsoft&apos;s Surface or Lenovo&apos;s Yoga range. IDC forecasts that only 9.9m will be shipped in 2014, and that even by 2018 they will only comprise 27.4m - equivalent to 8% of the tablet market (in which it classes them), or 9% of the PC market for laptops and desktops. IDC&apos;s forecast for 2014 was released before Intel raised its forecast revenues for this year, on the basis of expected higher business PC shipments, and said that it thought there would be &quot;some&quot; revenue growth this year rather than its previous &quot;approximately flat&quot; outlook. Although IDC&apos;s forecast goes out as far as four years into the future, it has consistently guided downwards on PC sales - and those lower estimates have tended to be correct, according to a time series of the forecasts collected by the Guardian.     IDC's forecast for mature market desktop/portable and emerging market desktop/portable, and tablets (including 2-in-1s). Photograph: /Guardian/IDC    In the graph above, each vertical line is a forecast made at a different time; earlier forecasts for each year are on the left of each series. The trend has been towards lower PC sales (the aggregate stack of blue, green and red) - and, now, lower forecast tablet sales (the orange line). Whereas emerging markets such as China and Africa have previously been the source of growth for PC sales, IDC is now lowering its future forecasts both for desktop and portable machines. Those point to sales of both desktops and portable machines being lower in 2018 than in 2013 in those countries; in aggregate they will be almost equal with 2014&apos;s forecast total of 163m units.  For developed markets such as the north America and Europe, the story is even worse: they will fall from around 133m units in 2013 and 2014 to 123.4m in 2018, says IDC. The PC market has slowed dramatically since 2011 as it has moved to a &quot;replacement&quot; market for the existing install base of around 1.6bn machines, while smartphone sales in particular have taken off, passing PCs at the end of 2010 and now on course to ship 1.2bn units in 2014 alone. Emerging shifts - away from PCs &quot;2014 represents an important shift for the PC market in emerging regions,&quot; said Jay Chou, IDC&apos;s senior research analyst. &quot;Shipments in these parts of the world are expected to contract in double digits - nearly 20m units fewer - compared to 2013. Political and economic instability in many of these markets are key factors affecting short-term intake, but a fundamental shift toward computing across the device spectrum represents a broader transition.&quot; The problem for PC makers is that smartphones and tablets - and especially large-screened phones known as &quot;phablets&quot; - are eating into the potential for PC companies. The problems are evident in the financial results of PC makers such as Taiwan&apos;s Asus and Acer, which each saw revenues from their PC divisions fall by 20% year-on-year during the first quarter of 2014 on shipments that were down 10% and 20% respectively. Japan&apos;s Sony is exiting the PC market completely, while Korea&apos;s LG is believed to be cutting back substantially. Dell, once the world&apos;s largest PC maker, went private last year amid growing pressure on PC margins. Only China&apos;s Lenovo, which bought IBM&apos;s PC business in 2005, has shown consistently improving profit margins on PCs. But PC makers that had hoped to find refuge in tablets might also be discouraged by IDC&apos;s forecast on tablets (including 2-in-1 models). While it is forecasting 19.4% growth in 2014, that is down from an explosive 51.6% in 2013 - suggesting that the market is already hitting saturation of sorts in some areas. IDC&apos;s expectation that tablet sales would outstrip those of PCs in the last quarter of 2013 didn&apos;t come to fruition - and now it seems that replacement cycles for tablets are more like four to five years, rather than the two or three years some makers had hoped. Tablet wars: slate v 2-in-1 In data supplied exclusively to the Guardian, IDC now forecasts that tablet shipments in 2017 will hit 323.6m, of which 300m will be &quot;slate&quot; tablets such as the iPad, compared to a 2-in-1 market of 23.6m and combined desktop and laptop PC market of 289.6m units.

If you got up before sunrise, you could see groups of six or seven young men sailing out towards the Atlantic Ocean in their precarious wooden pirogues. I worked with the fishermen as part of a European project. They told me how foreign trawlers were creeping closer to the shore, catching their fish and mangling their fragile nets. With their catches declining dramatically, the fishermen were forced to sail further and further out. One day, the pirogues did not return. Thirteen young men perished at sea, leaving families emotionally and economically devastated. A quarter of a century later, west Africa suffers proportionally more from illegal fishing than any other region of the world. Up to a quarter of jobs in the region are linked to fisheries, which is part of a vast intra-regional trading network in which women play a central role. Rising global demand for fish has made African waters a magnet for fleets from around the world. European trawlers remain the primary foreign presence, but fleets from China, the Philippines, Russia, South Korea and Taiwan have also expanded in recent years. Every year, the region loses $1.3bn worth of fish to illegal fishing. Apart from draining the region of revenue, overfishing reduces fish stocks, lowers local catches and harms the marine environment. It destroys communities, who lose opportunities to catch, process and trade fish. The silver lining around this stormy cloud is that these issues are now where they should be, at the top of the international political agenda. Next week the Global Ocean Commission will issue recommendations, including on illegal fishing, that \u2013 if fully implemented \u2013 will restore the ocean to ecological health and sustainable productivity. This follows a high-profile meeting at the State Department to mobilise the international community around ocean protection. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, hosted the meeting. Last month&apos;s Africa Progress Panel report on this issue sets out a detailed agenda to halt the plunder. African governments should increase fines on vessels that fish illegally, support artisanal fishing, increase transparency, and provide full disclosure of the terms on which commercial fishing permits are issued. It&apos;s time to limit the unequal and unfair competition between industrial fishing fleets and artisanal fisheries. Financing the plunder must also stop. Rich nations&apos; taxpayers spend $27bn a year in subsidies to those depleting the oceans, through, for example, cheap fuel and insurance. Major subsidisers include the European Union, Russia and east Asian nations with large &quot;distant water fishing fleets&quot;. At least part of these subsidies goes to fleets that are implicated in illegal fishing in Africa. Too often African nations lack the capacity to monitor and enforce compliance. They are weakened by the inaction of states that are unwilling or unable to carry out their regulatory responsibilities. A registry of fishing vessels that sail under a flag of convenience should be established, so African governments have the option of avoiding agreements with such vessels. Governments can also improve controls in ports where the fish catch is landed and reported. As Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general who chairs the Africa Progress Panel, has said: &quot;Commercial trawlers that operate under flags of convenience, and unload in ports that do not record their catch, are engaging in organised theft disguised as commerce.&quot; Illegal fishing is a form of theft that has major costs for the global community, which should back an initiative by Norway to establish illegal fishing as a &quot;transnational crime&quot;. This could bring it under the remit of Interpol, with police, customs agencies and justice ministries playing a more active role in enforcement. Furthermore, all nations should ratify and implement the Port State Measures Agreement, which would allow coastal nations to deny port entry and services to foreign vessels suspected of illegal fishing. Concerted international action to protect Africa&apos;s fisheries is urgent because the stakes are high \u2013 and not just in fishing villages like Tanji. Illegal fishing is putting the livelihoods and nutrition of millions of people on the continent at risk. Ultimately, this carries serious consequences for the rest of the world too, in terms of a sustainable supply of fish and protection against climate change. People in Tanji and many other coastal villages in Africa and across the globe will want to know that the international community is taking steps to end this plunder. \u2022 Caroline Kende-Robb is executive director of the Africa Progress Panel"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/20/hand-built-bikes-cycles-sculpted-measure", "publicationDate": "2014-06-20T09:00:00Z", "tags": ["Cycling", "Life and style", "Chris Froome", "Sport", "Team Sky", "Technology"], "sentences": ["But from the 1980s, larger manufacturers began to outsource production to the countries of the far east, particularly Taiwan and China."], "title": "Britain's cycle revolutionaries: the artisans who hand-craft bikes", "article": "Next month, Chris Froome and his Team Sky minders will ride around France on what are essentially two-wheeled, human-powered Formula One cars. The carbon machines \u2013 a collaboration between storied Italian bike-maker Pinarello and British car manufacturer Jaguar \u2013 could be the most efficient bicycles ever made: they are lighter, more rigid and 26.1% more aerodynamic than even their hi-tech predecessor. Called the Dogma F8, it is deemed so revolutionary that Team Sky disguised it on training rides to avoid disclosing its secrets. The F8 has just gone on sale for a shade under \u00a310,000. The bicycles that 37-year-old Matthew Sowter handcrafts at his workshop in Camberwell, south London, are a rather different proposition, technologically but also philosophically. They have not been tested in wind tunnels, and they are built using cutting machines, jigs and welding torches that have not changed radically in several decades. Sowter&apos;s company, Saffron Frameworks, makes 40 frames a year, all from a material \u2013 steel \u2013 that no weight-fixated cyclist would go near. The price for a frame and forks starts from \u00a31,500, and rises depending on the components used. For a growing number of riders, however, a bicycle from Saffron is as desirable \u2013 if not more so \u2013 than Froome&apos;s Pinarello Dogma F8. &quot;It&apos;s the difference between a sculpture and a tool,&quot; explains Collyn Ahart, who commissioned Sowter to make her a cyclo-cross bike. Ahart, 31, who worked in advertising and design agencies before setting up a women&apos;s clothing brand called Bowndling, wanted to specify the look, her riding position and also fussier demands, such as running all the cables and housings through the frame, so they didn&apos;t get clogged with muck when she went off-road. &quot;You start with these pieces of metal and you see this thing come to life,&quot; Ahart says. &quot;There&apos;s something special about that process; moments that are really surprising and extraordinary. There&apos;s a poetry that you just don&apos;t get from a mass-produced bike.&quot; Not long ago, many decent-sized towns in Britain had at least one frame-builder, who made bicycles mostly for members of the local cycling club. But from the 1980s, larger manufacturers began to outsource production to the countries of the far east, particularly Taiwan and China. A decade ago, scarcely a handful of traditional frame-builders remained \u2013 the likes of Mercian in Derby, Rourke in Stoke-on-Trent and Bob Jackson in Leeds \u2013 and their days appeared to be numbered. The situation is much rosier now. At the recent Bespoked show in Bristol, there were more than 150 exhibitors (an increase from 30 in 2010, the show&apos;s first year). New frame-builders aspire to follow the example of Donhou Bicycles, Feather Cycles and Saffron Frameworks, whose racing bike won best in show at Bespoked; each of these young companies has a waiting list of stretching between seven months and more than two years. It&apos;s an encouraging turnaround and one with many strands. No one can have failed to notice the cycling boom in Britain over the last few years, and with handmade bicycles this has dovetailed with the wider trend for all things local and artisanal. &quot;I will spend more money on really good cheese than store-bought cheese,&quot; says Ahart. &quot;It&apos;s the same ethic with my bike: you know there&apos;s a quality there and a human behind it.&quot; But buying a bespoke runaround is not an act of nostalgia. Steel has long been recognised as producing the most comfortable bicycles, but it was overtaken by lighter materials: aluminium, carbon and titanium. Threatened with extinction, two of the main producers of steel tubing \u2013 Reynolds in Birmingham and Italy&apos;s Columbus \u2013 were forced to innovate. The weight came down and stainless steel, which doesn&apos;t rust and has a higher tensile strength than mild steel, became a possibility. Crucially, stainless steel allows frame-builders to advertise their skills. &quot;The aesthetic is really important,&quot; says Sowter, a South African who made his first frame in 2009. &quot;You can polish it, brush it or just show off your craftsmanship by leaving it raw.&quot; The bikes on display at Bespoked were weirder and more wonderful than ever. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of creativity with the younger frame-builders,&quot; says Sowter. &quot;Handmade bikes used to be about making one model and then that was made-to-measure for the rider. Now they can be unique to the customer and what they want.&quot; Ahart agrees: her bike has idiosyncrasies that only she and Sowter know about. She also enjoys the fact that her new ride is a conversation-starter when she pulls up at red lights or goes out with a group. She laughs: &quot;Guys usually ask about my bike. Girls usually ask about my life. That&apos;s the difference, in a nutshell, between men and women in cycling. &quot;But the most important thing with a hand-built bike is that it&apos;s an expression of your personality and you can&apos;t get that with anything else.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2014/jun/20/why-worried-frankenfish-south-east-asia", "publicationDate": "2014-06-20T12:06:06Z", "tags": ["Fishing", "Animals", "Conservation", "Food", "Marine life", "Wildlife"], "sentences": ["Live grouper and other reef predators are highly-prized food in Hong Kong, Mainland China, Taiwan and other parts of south-east Asia.", "In reality, aquaculture has simply added a new market, with additional sealife being taken from the ocean to feed farmed fish in Malaysia, China and Taiwan.", "But then researchers in Taiwan began breeding hybrids with naturals and then different hybrids with each other."], "title": "Why we should be worried about 'Frankenfish' in south-east Asia | Johnny Langenheim", "article": "The fast-growing super salmon produced by American biotech company Aquabounty Technologies are poised to become the first genetically modified animals to hit food markets in the US, with approval from authorities widely expected later this year. But AquAdvantage\u00ae salmon has made headlines because of the potential risks to wild stocks in the Atlantic should they escape and breed. Hybrid grouper, on the other hand, gets almost no media attention, yet they potentially pose a greater threat to marine ecosystems because they\u2019re farmed at sea, not inland like salmon. Hybridisation through in-vitro fertilisation is big in south east Asia, where aquaculture businesses are interbreeding valuable grouper species in a bid to create a fast-growing super fish.  Live grouper and other reef predators are highly-prized food in Hong Kong, Mainland China, Taiwan and other parts of south-east Asia. They crowd tanks in seafood restaurants and are ubiquitous at Chinese wedding banquets and other formal occasions, where tradition demands they are served. Grouper can sell for well over US$100 (\u00a359) a kilo, with very large or rare specimens selling for much more.  The market is huge. In Hong Kong alone, an estimated 3.6 million grouper are consumed each year. Demand has led to rampant overfishing across South East Asia\u2019s Coral Triangle, a million square kilometre bioregion that\u2019s home to more marine species than anywhere else on earth. Fishermen often use cyanide to stun grouper, destroying coral reefs in the process. According to a recent University of Hong Kong study, one in ten grouper species face extinction if current trends aren\u2019t arrested.  In theory, advanced aquaculture techniques offer a way of fulfilling demand while reducing the pressure on wild populations. In reality, aquaculture has simply added a new market, with additional sealife being taken from the ocean to feed farmed fish in Malaysia, China and Taiwan.  Grouper are nurtured first in hatcheries from cultivated eggs and then in coastal cages or factories. Hybridisation aims to achieve the holy trinity of rapid growth rates, resilience and superior taste.  \u201cHybridisation of grouper isn\u2019t new,\u201d says Dr. Geoffrey Muldoon, a fisheries economist with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). \u201cAs far back as 1996 the University of Malaysia produced a giant grouper/tiger grouper hybrid, dubbed the Sabah Grouper specifically for live reef fish food markets in Hong Kong,\u201d he explains. The hybrid was popular with consumers and a boom followed. \u201cTwo decades on and the science of grouper hybridisation has exploded,\u201d says Muldoon. In the early days, scientists only experimented with cross breeding natural grouper species. But then researchers in Taiwan began breeding hybrids with naturals and then different hybrids with each other. According to Irwin Wong, a live fish trader in Sabah, at last count, there were at least 12 new hybrid grouper variants and research is continuing in what has become a race to create a super grouper. But what if they escape?  \u201cThe fact is, hybrids have already escaped,\u201d says Wong. \u201cIf there\u2019s a storm, fish often get free from coastal cages.\u201d  His fear is that two hybrids will breed in the wild. \u201cIf that happened, the effects on the ecosystem could be severe.\u201d Because captive hybrids are fed a mix of protein rich pellets and fish, they need to consume less than their wild counterparts to add weight, according to Muldoon. If they escaped and proliferated, there could be a dramatic knock on effect in terms of demand for prey species.  Grouper are hermaphrodites \u2013 or monandric protogynous hermaphrodites to give them their full title. Early in their growth cycle they are females, but in adulthood they can change into males. No one knows the precise trigger for this transformation, though size, age and environmental factors all play a part. Hybrid groupers in captivity are all female \u2013 but in the wild they could easily change sex, according to Wong. Which brings up the possibility of a sort of \u201cX-Grouper\u201d wreaking havoc with the food chain. The current scientific consensus is that hybrid grouper are infertile \u2013 but since their reproductive cycle isn\u2019t fully understood, this is far from fact. At an Intergovernmental Forum of the six Coral Triangle countries in early 2013, experts agreed that \u201chybridisation of grouper has reached an alarming level, that escapes pose an as yet unknown risk to local wild populations and that this issue needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.\u201d  The live reef fish for food trade is a notoriously under-regulated. It\u2019s also highly lucrative, worth as much as US$1 billion annually. But consumption tends to follow a boom and bust cycle. Once the Sabah Grouper became readily available its per kilo value dropped dramatically and many farmers found themselves priced out of the market.  \u201cSupply of hybrids is far outstripping demand,\u201d says Dr. Muldoon. \u201cA big question is, how will farmers dispose of hybrids they can\u2019t sell?\u201d He believes the industry needs to self-regulate for hybridisation to become viable. More research on both the science and the market for groupers is desperately needed \u2013 but patronage across the supply chain and an industry wide culture of secrecy make this difficult. In the meantime, the possibility of a \u201cFrankenfish\u201d wreaking havoc across reef ecosystems in the Coral Triangle is a real and growing danger. \u2022 Johnny Langenheim is a contributor to The Coral Triangle website"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/jun/20/science-design-materials-sources-sustainable", "publicationDate": "2014-06-20T13:44:30Z", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Sustainable design", "Fashion and textiles", "Ethical business", "Business", "Innovation", "Design", "Manufacturing sector"], "sentences": ["Photograph: Juan Carlos Ulate/REUTERS    Coffee grinds When researchers at Taiwan-based SINGTEX became interested in the odour control properties of coffee and how it could be integrated into fabrics, they started collecting leftover coffee grinds from coffeehouses near their homes and offices.", "S.Caf\u00e9\u00ae mylithe\u2122 fabric won a Taiwan Excellence Award in April this year."], "title": "The strange science behind design: materials from unusual sources", "article": "From as far back as the story of Adam and Eve, who used fig leaves as makeshift clothing in the Garden of Eden, humans have been imagining ways to use natural materials to clothe themselves.

Clothing from crabs? Photograph: Alamy    Crab shells Crabyon\u00ae is made by blending viscose with chitosan, a derivative of chitin. Chitin is a natural compound found in the shells of crabs and shellfish that protect them from their environment. Like cellulose from plant fibres, chitin is easy to process into textiles, because it has a soft texture and dyes easily. Crabyon\u00ae has antibacterial and odour control properties. It&apos;s sourced from the waste of crabmeat manufacturing and is fully biodegradable. The Swiss-based company, Swicofil asserts that the chitin used in the fabric has been scientifically processed, and the resulting fabric is safe and hypoallergenic for people with sensitive skin. This is good news for people with shellfish allergies. Chitosan typically makes up about 5 to 20% of final fabric blends. Chitin derivatives are also used in things like contact lens, surgical stitches and artificial skin.     Linen-like fabric made from Japanese paper is surprisingly durable.

Sasawashi\u00ae is a natural material made by combining Japanese paper with kumazasa, a hearty type of bamboo that grows in the highlands of Japan. Kumazasa has antibacterial, deodorant and moisture wicking properties. Similar to linen, Sasawashi\u00ae is used to make slippers, bath towels, bedding and stuffed animals. The SASAWASHI Company in Japan started as a joint venture with Dr Mitsuo Kimura of Mie University, who originally conducted research on how to make washi out of kumazasa. &quot;We can add cultural value to our products, because kumazasa grows only in Japan and has been used for wrapping sushi etc from ancient times,&quot; said Toshinori Itoi of the Sasawashi Company.

Today Thread has collection centres in nearly a dozen Haitian cities, and collectors have access to training and waste education in their neighborhoods, Rosenberger explained. &quot;We&apos;re focusing on the bottom end of the supply chain and reaching up,&quot; he said. After collection and basic processing, Haitian plastics are taken to the US to create 100% post-consumer recycled fabric that is used to consumer goods like messenger bags.

More and more companies are collaborating to make and share materials in unusual ways. Ford recently partnered with Heinz to make car parts out of leftover tomato fibres from ketchup production. But as more companies close the loop, will we see even stranger collaborations? Will there be textiles that never die in an endless circle of old polyester clothing recycled back into new polyester clothing? The future of fabrics is about to get even weirder.

According to OpenGarden, its developers, in just one weekend in early June it was downloaded by more than 40,000 people in Iraq. Firechat is a messaging app based on the concept of &quot;peer-to-peer mesh networking&quot;. It runs on smartphones and tablets like a normal chat programme, but as well as communicating with a central server to upload and download messages \u2013 as services such as WhatsApp work \u2013 it can work without any centralised control at all.  &quot;Your phone today, your smartphone, not only has a radio to connect to a cell tower, but it also has other radios like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, to connect to other devices around,&quot; explains OpenGarden co-founder Micha Benoliel. &quot;And when smartphones are next to each other with Firechat, they directly interconnect.&quot; Firechat listens out, on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, for other phones running the same app. If they &quot;hear&quot; one, they can talk to each other, and even pass on messages meant for other phones in the vicinity. With enough phones in one area, a &quot;mesh&quot; is built up, letting any phone speak to any other phone, and all without going on to the internet at all. (When using mesh networking, Firechat can&apos;t connect to the internet even if one phone at the edge of the mesh has a connection - but that is OpenGarden&apos;s eventual aim.) On Monday, a new version of the app, released as Firechat &lt;3, or &quot;Firechat Love&quot;, merges the Android and iOS versions into one cross-compatible app, expanding that mesh still further. Benoliel hopes that with the new release, the company can build its install base, not just in typical target markets like the UK and US, but also in places like Iraq and Taiwan, which saw its own spike in downloads during April&apos;s student protests when the government threatened to shut down the internet. Despite not having its own app store, Iraq is now the second biggest country in terms of usage for Firechat. For now, the service remains freely available \u2013 unlike Facebook and Twitter, both of which have been targeted by government censors in the wake of the ISIS uprising in the north of the country. Until Friday 13 June, there had been a total of just 6,600 downloads from IP addresses in the country in the since the beginning of April. But even if the authorities do decide to turn on it, the app has reached the critical mass required for mesh networks to form in some parts of Baghdad. Benoliel says that the company&apos;s internal research indicates that theoretically, just 7 or 8% of the population need to have the app &quot;to enable you to be connected to someone else more than 93% of the time.&quot; He concedes that in practice, the number required is likely to be larger, but points out that &quot;if you look at famous gaming apps that reached 60% penetration ratio, we are still far from [requiring] that number&quot;. Even outside of Iraq (and Iran, which is now the company&apos;s third largest market), the ability to talk over mesh networks can come in handy. &quot;You can use it in the tube, you can use it in an airplane, you can use it in a crowded place where you normally wouldn&apos;t have internet access like a concert or some conference venues.&quot; Mesh messages aren&apos;t encrypted in transit, so the app isn&apos;t safe for &quot;secure or private&quot; conversations: it&apos;s &quot;off-the-grid&quot;, but not secret. Although Firechat is more than just text messaging \u2013 it can handle photos and videos, as well \u2013 the app itself was originally conceived as little more than a proof of concept for OpenGarden&apos;s technology. &quot;It was supposed to be a test when we launched the app, and we got a huge spike from day one.&quot; Many assumed the app relied on a new technology introduced in Apple&apos;s recently released iOS 7, which is why it came &quot;as a surprise to everybody when we launched on Android a few weeks after.&quot; But the networking tech which makes it tick is OpenGarden&apos;s own, and in the long run, Benoliel hopes to see it used to enable internet access amongst communities where connectivity is poor or nonexistent. &quot;We believe there are, traditional players in connectivity, like the carriers, and the mobile operators. There is a new breed of player, like Google or Facebook, that are coming to the market with solutions which require billions of dollars of investment, and which can be also sometimes very experimental.&quot; Then there&apos;s OpenGarden. &quot;We are very pragmatic with our approach. We turn every smartphone, every smart device, into a router, into an internet node, and this can be done with no investment, thanks to a simple app that is completely free.&quot; The company plans to make its own income by charging businesses for a cut of the money they make speaking to customers on the app. &quot;That way, basically, we charge our partners for every dollar they make when normally they wouldn&apos;t be able to make it because they are not connected to a cellular tower or a wifi hotspot.&quot; Benoliel is at pains to point out that he&apos;s not competing with Facebook&apos;s Internet.org intiative, or Google X&apos;s plan to string up internet-enabled weather balloons over areas with bad connectivity, saying &quot;that&apos;s great, and we need more and more capacity.&quot; But he wears the &quot;disruptive&quot; label with pride. &quot;Our first motivation has always been to provide free internet, and enable freedom of speech to a maximum number of people.

It expects that to rise to $1.6tn in 2014, $1.75tn in 2015 and $1.85 tn in 2016. Before we go any further, let&apos;s just give the World Bank&apos;s definition of FDI outflows and inflows:  FDI net inflows are the value of inward direct investment made by non-resident investors in the reporting economy. FDI net outflows are the value of outward direct investment made by the residents of the reporting economy to external economies.   Flows to developing countries reached a record high of $778bn, which makes them worth 54% of the worldwide amount. This meant that for the second-year-running, developing countries took more investment than developed ones, which with $566bn had a historically low share of 39% despite showing growth on 2012.       One of the other key areas the report looks at is how these figures fit into the Sustainable development goals that the UN are currently formulating. It estimates that there is set to be a $2.5tn year-on-year shortfall in many of the key areas that the goals will identify.  Which countries and regions rank top and bottom for investment received? Asia retains its place as the continental grouping with the most FDI, with its $426bn inflows making it worth almost 30% of worldwide investment. Most of this was due to rising investment in China, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan.       FDI to the EU began to grow again with its member countries receiving $246bn, an increase of 14% on 2012. However, the EU still received less than 30% of what it was getting in its peak year 2007. Although Latin America and the Caribbean saw overall positive growth in FDI inflows, it was mostly due to Central American growth despite a 6% decline in South America.  The chart below looks at the top host countries for FDI in 2013. United States stays as the top country with \u00a3188bn investment after growth of 17%.       Other countries showing growth in inflows included Russia (up 57%), Spain (up 52%) and Mexico (up 117%). The UK was down 20% on 2012, which goes against the general growth in the European region. Italy, grew by a massive 1,174% year-on-year, which was partially down to a return to normal levels after a huge drop off in investment in 2012. Which countries are the biggest investors? As well as including the amount invested in the country, the report also looks at the amount spent by companies and bodies in each country. These are called FDI outflows and despite a decline of 14.5%, North America remains the top region for outward investment for a second year with $381bn.        Continued growth of outward investment in Asia, saw it start to catch up on North America. FDI outflows from China grew to $101bn in 2013 and are expected to surpass its inflows within three years. Sustainable development gap projection The United Nations are currently formulating the Sustainable development goals (SDGs), which will replace the Millenium development goals following the latter&apos;s target date being reached in 2015.  The report has looked at several of the key areas that the SDGs are likely to target and estimated a total annual investment ranging between $3.3tn to $4.5tn is required for developing countries to meet their sustainability needs between 2015 and 2030, as the report says these are:  Mainly for basic infrastructure (roads, rail and ports; power stations; water and sanitation), food security (agriculture and rural development), climate change mitigation and adaptation, health, and education.  They estimate that current levels of investment are at $1.4tn, giving an annual investment gap of $2.5tn. That&apos;s public and private funding, so not just the FDIs we have been talking about earlier in the report.  Part of the burden could be alleviated by increases in that private sector investment, as if that stays at current growth rates the report says that would imply a &quot;nine-fold increase in public sector funding requirements by 2030&quot; - obviously not a viable target. Several areas where increased private investment opportunities could come are identified in the graph below     Potential private sector contribution to investment gaps at current and high participation levels. Graph: UNCTAD    Climate change mitigation, power, transport, water and sanitation are identified as areas with room for growth while others such as education and healthcare are more problematic.

The smaller of the two would have a display measuring 4.7in diagonally compared with 4in for the current iPhone 5S. That would be around the same size, but not necessarily aspect ratio, as Amazon&apos;s recently released Fire Phone, or the 2012&apos;s Samsung Galaxy S III.  The larger of the rumoured phones would be 5.5in, firmly in &quot;phablet&quot; territory, equivalent in size to Samsung&apos;s 5.7in Galaxy Note 3. According to Bloomberg, which reported the latest round of leaks, the new iPhones &quot;will also be rounder and thinner than previous models.&quot; The site also reported that the larger model is facing production hurdles due to its complexity, &quot;resulting in lower production efficiency that must be overcome before manufacturing volume can be increased.&quot; As for what that complexity entails, a research note from analyst firm KGI suggests one possibility: that the 5.5in model will ship with a camera lens outfitted for optical image stabilisation. &quot;The 5.5in iPhone 6 is more likely to be equipped with [optical image stabilisation] due to lower estimated shipments and the need for more product features to differentiate itself from the 4.7in iPhone 6,&quot; the analysts say. Bloomberg&apos;s report is by no means the first to suggest that the latest iPhone will be larger than the 5s, nor even the first to finger 4.7 inches as the specific display size. In February, reports from Taiwan&apos;s Economic Daily News made broadly the same claims as, describing 4.7 and 5.6 inch models as being in production And the smokiest gun of all came at Apple&apos;s WWDC event, where the firm detailed the new technology that will be going in to iOS 8, likely to debut alongside the new iPhones. A feature called &quot;adaptive display&quot; lets developers program assets for screens of unknown or varying sizes \u2013 exactly what would be needed if the iPhone lineup was to fragment into small, medium and large models. That feature is just the latest in a line of additions that make iOS more suitable to large screens; the swipe functionality introduced in iOS 7 allows one-handed use of larger devices by rendering the awkwardly-placed back button -placed at the top left of the screen on older software and so furthest from the thumb - unnecessary. As well as size, another consistent thread has emerged: that the glass used in the screens of the new iPhones will have some fancy properties of its own. Apple has begun to buy sapphire crystal, the ultra-hard material which it currently uses only in the lenses of its cameras, in larger quantities than ever before, while reports from Bloomberg in November as well as patents filed in January suggest that pressure sensitivity may be in the pipeline, letting the devices distinguish between heavy and light touches. However, that feature may not make it in to the latest devices. As Apple&apos;s hardware chain grows, leaks like this look likely to become more and more common. Back in 2009, barely anything was known about the iPhone 3G before it made its debut, but in the entire first quarter, just 6.9m units were sold. Four years later, the iPhone 5S sold more than 50m units, and largely avoided supply chain shortages throughout (with the exception of the coveted gold model). But Apple could only pull that off by involving an order of magnitude more people in the process before launch. And as scale grows, secrecy shrinks. However that does not seem to hold for software: Apple announced Swift, a whole new programming language, to a completely unsuspecting audience at WWDC. For the first five years of its life, the iPhone came in just one screen size, the same 3.5in model that the original model was available in. The iPhone 5, released in September 2012, was the first with a larger screen, measuring 4in, but even at the time of its release, it was still significantly smaller than top-end Android phones. The contemporaneous Samsung Galaxy SIII had a 4.8in display. But Apple has never said conclusively that it wouldn&apos;t bring out a phone that was larger still. When asked about the possibility in February this year, Tim Cook said that &quot;until the technology is ready, we don\u2019t want to cross that line. That doesn\u2019t say we\u2019ll never do it. We want to give our customers what\u2019s right in all respects \u2013 not just the size but in the resolution, in the clarity, in the contrast, in the reliability. There are many different parameters to measure a display and we care about all those, because we know that\u2019s the window to the software.&quot; One other reason is likely the firm&apos;s passion for consistency, says Roberta Cozza of analyst firm Gartner. Tim Cook is famously proud of the fact that all of Apple&apos;s products can fit on one table, in contrast to the likes of Samsung, who have hundreds of models of phone available at any one time.  &quot;I think that Apple has been happy to have a more consistent portfolio to help the ecosystem of developers,&quot; says Cozza. &quot;But at the same time, to give Samsung credit, it has been the vendor that has the scale and can afford to be more experimental. They found this niche of bigger display phones, that is very attractive for Asian markets.&quot; Cozza argues that the reason for the steady upwards shift in smartphone screen size is the increasing complex demands we place on our devices. &quot;The devices are more and more effective as media consumption devices, which has helped drive the demand for bigger displays. &quot;There has been a lot of focus around consuming media on smartphones. It is the device that is always with you, at the end of the day. From an apps perspective, from a service perspective, it is really at the focus of everything. The tablet is still a companion, it is a device that you use in certain scenarios.&quot; \u2022 Apple WWDC: expect a bigger iPhone - and bigger ambitions"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/jun/26/google-io-evaluated", "publicationDate": "2014-06-26T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "sentences": ["Apple&apos;s new phone drives a wedge between Korea and Taiwan &gt;&gt; WSJ Digits blog  Apple&apos;s hotly anticipated iPhone 6 could be helping to break up one of Asia&apos;s most dependable economic relationships.", "Factory output from South Korea and Taiwan long has moved almost in lockstep as both helped meet global technology demand.", "But Apple is trying to reduce its reliance for parts on smartphone rival Samsung Electronics, and the iPhone 6 could pull Taiwan more firmly into a production orbit independent of Korea&apos;s.

The core objective of Android has always been to provide the widest possible audience for Google&apos;s services, but over the last several years Google has seen a variety of device vendors customize, tweak and fork Android in ways that either submerge Google&apos;s services beneath their own or strip them out entirely. Google has achieved its objective of creating a very widely used mobile operating system, but it&apos;s a very Google-light version of Android which is driving that growth. Android One is ostensibly about expanding the availability of cheap smartphones using Android in emerging markets, but Android is already the default operating system for cheap smartphones. The problem is that it&apos;s often a version of Android which has very little to do with Google. Android One will re-enshrine Google&apos;s services at the center of these devices, which will run stock Android and be free from the sorts of customizations so popular with the largest Android manufacturers, notably Samsung.

Google Play emerges as powerful weapon for internet giant &gt;&gt; WSJ Except it&apos;s not so much a &quot;weapon&quot; as an asset.   There are now more apps available in the Play store, 1.5m, than the App Store, 1.2m, according to market researcher App Annie. App downloads from the Play store surpassed those from the App Store for the first time in 2013. The App Store still generated more than twice as much revenue for developers last year, but that was down from six times as much in 2012. Google Chief Business Officer Nikesh Arora told investors in April that Play store payments to developers quadrupled in 2013 from 2012. &quot;Growth on the [Android] platform has been tremendous,&quot; said Eric Feng, chief technology officer at Flipboard, the maker of a popular reading app for smartphones and tablets. Flipboard&apos;s first Android app was released 18 months ago, more than two years after it made its debut on iPads and later iPhones. Despite the late start, today more than half of the company&apos;s users are on Android devices, Mr. Feng said. Apple users generate more revenue, in part because the owners of more-expensive iPhones and iPads tend to have higher incomes than Android users. &quot;But Android users are becoming very valuable at this point,&quot; said Phil Libin, chief executive of Evernote, the maker of a popular note-taking app. Android&apos;s growing popularity is enabling Google to extract bigger profits from app sales. That is a change from a few years ago, when the company kicked back a hefty share of those sales to wireless carriers.  First gen Nokia X devices won&apos;t be updated to Platform 2.0 &gt;&gt; Neowin  The first generation Nokia X smartphones which were released in February, will not be getting updated to the Nokia X software featured on the Nokia X2. In a detailed post about the Nokia X2 smartphone user experience on the Conversations blog, Microsoft&apos;s Yannis Paniaras, Head of the Mobile Phones UX Design Studio in Beijing, has revealed that\u00a0&quot;because of the necessary hardware upgrades, the Nokia X software platform 2.0 won&apos;t be available on Nokia X, Nokia X+ or Nokia XL. However, more updates will be coming to further improve the experience of those devices in the coming months.&quot;  Will those owners care? Almost certainly not. Apple&apos;s new phone drives a wedge between Korea and Taiwan &gt;&gt; WSJ Digits blog  Apple&apos;s hotly anticipated iPhone 6 could be helping to break up one of Asia&apos;s most dependable economic relationships. Factory output from South Korea and Taiwan long has moved almost in lockstep as both helped meet global technology demand. But Apple is trying to reduce its reliance for parts on smartphone rival Samsung Electronics, and the iPhone 6 could pull Taiwan more firmly into a production orbit independent of Korea&apos;s. Taiwan&apos;s industrial production index rose 5.2% on-year in May, beating economists&apos; forecasts, after rising 5.29% in April and 3.2% in March. Korea won&apos;t report May industrial production until Friday, but its April production slowed to 2.4% on-year, from 2.6% in March.  It seems incredibly unlikely that one company&apos;s parts-buying from one other company could drive industrial indexes for two entire countries. There&apos;s a correlation there (it&apos;s in the article), but the real causation might be trickier to unpick. A peek at Google&apos;s M&amp;A ambitions &gt;&gt; Fortune Interview with Don Harrison, vp of corporate development at Google:   Q: Over the past year, a lot of deals are for companies that have ended up over at Google X, the semi-secret lab were Google cooks up its most advanced projects. What kind of mandate has Larry given you? A: They are not so much Google X as new product areas within Google.\u00a0At its highest level the mandate is to find interesting companies that are moving things forward that are solving big problems. Our acquisitions generally fall into three rough buckets. We look for smaller deals that are focused on talent and technology. We also focus on areas where we identified a core functionality that we are we are trying to implement across a product, and we can fill out that offering as a result of buying companies. There&apos;s a third area, which is still core, where we recognize that we need to be in an area, but we need to get to scale quickly.

That means that everyone comes out ahead\u2026 except the poor sap who gets to the parking spot later in the day \u2014 you know, when people are just getting out of work \u2014 and can&apos;t find any takers for the $20 parking spot in front of their friendly neighborhood Chipotle. \u2026MonkeyParking&apos;s users aren&apos;t renting out their spare room or driving people around in a car they paid for, they&apos;re auctioning off a public good that they have no right to\u00a0sell in the first place.

This compares to a score for iOS based iPhones that went from 55 in Q4 2013 to 63 in Q1 2014. User satisfaction is driven by several factors that relate to three main areas: hardware design and specs, price point, and ecosystem: For most consumers, ecosystem today translates to availability of applications. In a not too distant future, ecosystem will translate more and more to interoperability of products and seamlessness of experience across those products.  Twilio turns Google Chromebooks into call center phones &gt;&gt; CITEworld  The real key value here, Smith says, is ease of setup: Sign in to the Chromebooks with a company-activated Google Apps account, plug in the headset, open the browser, and you&apos;re officially online and able to take calls. All the communication magic happens behind the scenes in Twilio&apos;s cloud.\u00a0 This is in stark contrast to unified communications solutions from telecommunications vendors like Cisco\u00a0or Microsoft,\u00a0which tend to be more complicated to set up and run. The simplicity and low cost of the Chromebook is quite a different approach than Cisco&apos;s latest device, a desktop communications terminal with high-end audio and video that will cost around $1,500, and is more in line with a cost-based approach toward customer service.  This is a real disruptive opportunity for Chromebooks - low-end, simple, cheap, functional, rolls in computer functionality. (Updated with correct link - apologies for earlier error.)

The seven-times Wimbledon champion brushed aside his opponent\u2019s clattering strokes and the irritation of a mid-evening rain delay to win 6-3, 7-5, 6-3. It was not just welcome passage into the next round but the exorcism of a demon, as Federer had crashed out of Wimbledon in the second round last year to the serve and volley tactics of the Russian Sergiy Stakhovsky. That was his earliest defeat at Wimbledon in more than a decade, suggesting a growing and perhaps irreversible frailty. But those fears now seem to have been unfounded. Federer, who served 25 aces with precison and menace, took just 13 minutes to get the measure of M\u00fcller\u2019s power. He secured his first break in the fifth game of the first set and quickly began to find the angles of Centre Court with flat forehands. M\u00fcller\u2019s only weapon was his serve but it lacked the consistency to cause undue discomfort. His opponent\u2019s serve, meanwhile, was the epitome of speed and placement. In the initial set Federer won all the points on his first serve, and he dropped just nine points on first serve throughout the match. M\u00fcller, 31, 6ft 4in and a left-hander, seemed keen to bully Federer with big ground strokes but was unable to dominate. The Swiss, clearly happy with his service game, seemed content to be patient and await his opportunity. The bigger opponent would prove to be the weather. With Federer leading 4-3, the darkening clouds yielded drizzle and then light rain, which led to play being suspended after just under and hour. Within moments of the covers being pulled over, officials began the 20-minute process of closing the Centre Court roof. Under cover and lights they resumed as before, each holding serve until Federer, leading 6-5, rifled a backhand past a stranded M\u00fcller to set up a break point. He took the break, and second set, at the second opportunity. Federer then broke again to go 3-1 up in the third set and the die was cast. With the roof on he was told they might play until 11pm if need be. But he was done by 8.30pm and the auspices are good. On the three previous occasions that Federer has beaten M\u00fcller, he has won the title. \u201cIt was a serving contest and I\u2019m happy I made it because it was tough with the rain delay,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to make aces, good for the confidence, but I have to keep working hard to keep the consistency.\u201d Elsewhere the 19-year-old Australian wildcard, Nick Kyrgios, the youngest man in the draw, became an unexpected slayer of the 13th seed, Richard Gasquet, in five sets. Kyrgios, ranked 144 in the world, lost the first two sets to the Frenchman. But then he saved nine match points to triumph 3-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-5, 10-8 in a match that enthralled No2 Court for almost three hours. Earlier Stanislaw Wawrinka beat Lu Yen-hsun of Taiwan in four sets to reach the third round, which meant the Australian Open champion had secured back-to-back wins at Wimbledon for the first time since 2009. The 10th seed, Kei Nishikori, also had a good day, defeating American qualifier Denis Kudla in straight sets. His next opponent will be Italian qualifier Simone Bolelli, who beat the German Philipp Kohlschreiber over five sets. There was drama, too, on Court 12 as the Frenchman Ga\u00ebl Monfils, seeded 24th, once again produced the incredible and the inexplicable. He lost the first two sets against the Czech Jiri Vesely, won the next two and then lost the decider to give Vesely, ranked 117 and making his debut at Wimbledon, victory in five sets; a landmark victory for him, business as usual for the hot and cold Monfils."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/27/edinburgh-best-british-film-michael-powell-hide-and-seek", "publicationDate": "2014-06-27T13:26:49Z", "tags": ["Edinburgh film festival", "Film", "Awards and prizes", "Culture", "Festivals", "Still Life"], "sentences": ["With the film produced and funded from Taiwan, Myanmar-born Midi Z said: &quot;I would like to thank Taiwan for nurturing me, for turning a country boy from Burma into a director who has just launched his career in film.&quot; The ceremony took place at Edinburgh&apos;s Filmhouse cinema ahead of the festival&apos;s closing film on Sunday."], "title": "Edinburgh gives top award to partner-swapping film Hide and Seek", "article": "The Edinburgh film festival has given its Michael Powell award for best British feature to Hide and Seek, directed by Joanna Coates, at its awards ceremony on Friday.

Directed by Uberto Pasolini, producer of The Full Monty, Still Life is the story of a council worker whose job it is to track down next of kin. Marsan said: \u201cStill Life is so special to me because it&apos;s such a personal film for its writer and director, Uberto Pasolini ... so I accept this award on Uberto&apos;s behalf as much as mine.&quot; The best documentary award was handed to Swiss production My Name Is Salt, directed by Farida Pacha, about salt harvesting in the Gujarat region of India. The jury said: &quot;It is a beautifully shot and edited film that details the cyclical nature of salt harvesting ... The film itself mirrors this cycle with delicacy and restraint ... We wish Farida Pacha well with her film-making in the future.&quot; Meanwhile, Ice Poison was named the best film in the international competition. Directed by Midi Z, it tells the story of a poverty-stricken farmer struggling for a livelihood in Myanmar. With the film produced and funded from Taiwan, Myanmar-born Midi Z said: &quot;I would like to thank Taiwan for nurturing me, for turning a country boy from Burma into a director who has just launched his career in film.&quot; The ceremony took place at Edinburgh&apos;s Filmhouse cinema ahead of the festival&apos;s closing film on Sunday.

The movie business is treating the clean sweep as a sign that its strategy for balancing the entertainment requirements of the world&apos;s two largest markets is paying off. Hollywood is devoting resources and star power to breaking open the tightly controlled region. Earlier this month, Jolie, Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Mark Wahlberg and Johnny Depp all went to China to support releases that could add up to a quarter of takings. Seducing the Chinese market can be as simple as adding Chinese locations, such as in the recent James Bond film Skyfall. In X-Men: Days of Future Past, half an hour of action takes place in Hong Kong, with Chinese star Li Bingbing and a Chinese boyband added to the superhero mix. With relations between Washington and Beijing tense, Hollywood&apos;s wooing of China can be similarly fraught. Two years ago, Quentin Tarantino&apos;s Django Unchained was yanked from cinemas after censors claimed it showed scenes too violent for Chinese audiences. Until its scheduled release last month, Warner Brothers was uncertain whether censors at China&apos;s state administration of press, publication, radio, film and television would permit the release of Godzilla, given its heavy association with Japan and the tension between Beijing and Tokyo over maritime territories. Disney was concerned that Jolie&apos;s recent comments on the political sovereignty of &quot;self-ruled Taiwan&quot; might keep mainland Chinese viewers away. But Maleficent still took a respectable $22m at the Chinese box office after Jolie, husband Brad Pitt and several of their children shared a birthday cake with a crowd in Shanghai and took lessons in making dim sum. Hollywood&apos;s current success will partially settle fears that it was losing ground to domestic Chinese releases. US film studios are counting on increased foreign sales to offset a decline in American cinema visits and the virtual collapse of the DVD market. The Chinese market was worth $3.6bn in ticket sales last year \u2013 more than enough to warrant substantial plot changes to appeal to Chinese filmgoers. US film executives are urgently looking to make deals in China. Last week Jeff Robinov, a former Warner Bros president known for approving the Matrix series, The Lego Movie and Gravity, signed a $1bn deal with Chinese investment giant Fosun to make films in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Some executives say the deal could help film-makers get around Chinese rules that limit the number of foreign-made releases in the country to 34 a year. But with Chinese films&apos; box-office share down 12% in the past year to 40%, there may be renewed efforts to counter the US invasion. Critics warn that Hollywood&apos;s closer ties with Beijing could mean that film-makers are less willing to touch on sensitive topics such as the Dalai Lama, the Falun Gong sect, and the Chinese market for rhinoceros horn, ivory and other items from critically endangered species. How much western culture Chinese audiences are willing to consume \u2013 and how much censors allow \u2013 is open to question. Disney recently announced an $800m deal with a Chinese consortium of state-owned companies to boost investment in Shanghai Disneyland, increasing the number of rides when it opens next year. The resort, one of the largest ever foreign investments in China, includes a 225-acre Magic Kingdom-style park with a castle surrounded by themed areas, with guests entering through a lush 11-acre garden. But Chinese entrepreneurs are preparing to gamble on the Chinese ultimately choosing homegrown fare. China&apos;s wealthiest man, Wang Jianlin, owner of the AMC cinema chain in the US and Imax theatres in China, is reportedly planning theme parks across China celebrating its history and mythology. &quot;Wang wants to save China from American cultural invasion and Disney,&quot; said one executive familiar with the plan. &quot;So he&apos;s going to make it better than Disney, with Chinese dragons, Shaolin warrior monks, the lot.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/04/hong-kong-protests-mobile-game", "publicationDate": "2014-07-04T15:06:38Z", "tags": ["Hong Kong", "Protest", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Games", "Technology", "Culture"], "sentences": ["On a bulletin board someone has tacked a sketch of Edward Snowden, and next to it a poster depicting Taiwan&apos;s Sunflower Movement, another recent mass demonstration against Beijing."], "title": "Hong Kong protests inspire mobile game", "article": "You&apos;re leading a protest against an oppressive regime. Your followers stream out of downtown skyscrapers to join you, until the crowd becomes a long, multicoloured tail stretching on for blocks. Around the corner lies salvation: a &quot;voting station&quot; where people can cast ballots for democracy. But the road ahead is teeming with police. Helicopters close in overhead. Suddenly, the world goes black. Game over: you&apos;ve been arrested. Would you like to share your score? Love and Peace, a game for mobile phones designed by the Hong Kong-based games company nxTomo, is like a complex, three-dimensional reinterpretation of the classic arcade game Snake \u2013 but with strong political overtones. nxTomo&apos;s general manager, Adam Siu, 42, says games are like movies and books: they represent the people who make them. And Hong Kong residents have spent recent weeks mired in a debate about civil disobedience. &quot;I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any real message in the game,&quot; said Siu. &quot;It&apos;s more of a reflection of reality.&quot; On Tuesday, the 17th anniversary of the former British colony&apos;s return to mainland control, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in Hong Kong&apos;s biggest pro-democracy demonstrations in recent history. While the protesters&apos; demands are varied, their unanimous target is Beijing \u2013 its creeping influence over the city&apos;s boardrooms, newspapers, classrooms and courts. Around 500 people, most of them students, were arrested for staging a sit-in, and on Friday police arrested five protest organisers, including the &quot;front convenor&quot; Johnson Yeung Ching-yin, 22, ostensibly for blocking traffic. Hong Kong has a strong recent history of protest, but analysts say this year&apos;s participants were particularly young, digitally savvy and willing to break the law to make themselves heard. &quot;Their main platform is Facebook,&quot; said Charles Mok, a legislative councillor in Hong Kong and former president of the Hong Kong Information Technology Federation. The demographic shift began in 2012, he said, when thousands of students, led by a 15-year-old high-schooler, mobilised to halt an impending &quot;patriotic education&quot; campaign, leading the government to revise its plans. &quot;[Hong Kong&apos;s students] won that battle, and ever since then they&apos;ve become more active on a lot of other political issues as well \u2013 even participating in the political process, proposing their own reform packages and so on,&quot; Mok said. &quot;They&apos;ve been able to organise younger people in a much bigger way than before.&quot;     A frame of the mobile game Love and Peace    nxTomo is a division of Next Media, Hong Kong&apos;s largest media company and one of its most stridently pro-democratic. It operates out of a windowless, fluorescent-lit office in the bowels of a cavernous warehouse in the city&apos;s far-flung suburbs. On a bulletin board someone has tacked a sketch of Edward Snowden, and next to it a poster depicting Taiwan&apos;s Sunflower Movement, another recent mass demonstration against Beijing. The game is based on Occupy Central with Love and Peace (OCLP), a pro-reform civil disobedience movement that has threatened to mobilise 10,000 people to paralyse the city&apos;s central business district later this year. The group has demanded that Beijing, which controls Hong Kong under a &quot;one country, two systems&quot; framework, grant the city a more democratic voting process by 2017. Last month, OCLP organised an unofficial &quot;civil referendum&quot;, allowing Hong Kong residents to choose how they would like to pick their next leader. Although more than 700,000 people \u2013 about a tenth of the city&apos;s population \u2013 cast pro-democratic votes, Beijing has refused to compromise. One day in early June, Siu stumbled across a YouTube video showing a little girl singing a Cantonese version of Do You Hear the People Sing from Les Mis\u00e9rables, the pro-democracy movement&apos;s unofficial anthem. &quot;If our generation is to have a future, we need to open our eyes,&quot; sings the unnamed girl. It gave Siu an idea. His team had been working on a protest-themed game for the past two years, and the frenzy surrounding Occupy Central gave them an excuse to release a prototype. He called five employees to his corner office \u2013 designers, producers, engineers. &quot;I said take this function out, take that function out, make it simpler and simpler,&quot; he said. &quot;Some of us didn&apos;t sleep for three, four days.&quot; On 18 June, six days after the team began working, they launched the game on the Google Play store. (The release was only temporary, Sui said; he took the game down after Tuesday&apos;s protest.) Just before the launch, Siu reached out to friends to ask for their input. Kit Man, 34, an app designer and budding political cartoonist, was happy help. &quot;I think the [Occupy Central] movement itself is a little bit clumsy \u2013 its leaders are very academic,&quot; he said, sitting in his concrete-floored studio in the industrial district Kwun Tong. &quot;They&apos;re all from the university, and they do things in a very gentle way, emphasising love and peace. But Beijing, to me, is like a thief. How can a lecturer fight a thief?&quot; After the patriotic education protests, Man helped establish a collective of illustrators called HKSoc Comic, which uses Facebook as its primary platform. His cartoons often feature ugly caricatures of dissembling local politicians. One shows a hunched, nefarious-looking man in a Communist-style hat selling a dilapidated house to an anxious customer. &quot;It&apos;s not quite perfect, but move in first and if you have problems later, I&apos;ll help you fix them,&quot; the Communist says. &quot;It&apos;s a metaphor,&quot; Man explained. &quot;Beijing always says accept our conditions now, and things will get better in the future. But do you really trust them?&quot; Man has faced subtle pressure for his work. In mid-June, just when HKSoc began advertising the referendum, Facebook blocked the site&apos;s admin page, making it impossible to update. He has spent weeks lobbying Facebook to unblock the site, with little progress. His family has urged him to stop drawing \u2013 most of his income comes from designing apps, and they fear that by provoking Beijing he&apos;ll lose access to a valuable market. The invisible threat has only made him more outspoken. &quot;This is how they scare the community, so they won&apos;t speak out,&quot; he said. &quot;And I think that&apos;s not acceptable at all.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/jul/07/australian-uk-universities-links-china", "publicationDate": "2014-07-07T06:00:00Z", "tags": ["Higher Education Network", "Australia Fortnight", "Research", "International", "Higher education", "Education", "Research", "China", "Australian education", "Australia news"], "sentences": ["Korea and Taiwan have near universal levels of tertiary participation.", "Australia has higher rates of research collaboration in China, Taiwan and Singapore (though it is weaker in Korea) than the US."], "title": "Links with China: why Australian universities are leading the way", "article": "Terra Australis was first sighted by European ships in the early 17th century, settled by England in 1788, and morphed into the self-governing dominion of Australia in 1901. The nation became more independent of Britain after the second world war when, together with the US, it blocked invasion from Japan. Yet Australian higher education continues to look remarkably like that of the UK. There is just one difference, but in the long run it will be very important. In the last generation both the UK and Australia have doubled the proportion of the population entering higher education. Both have moved from near free tuition to high tuition, funded by loans repaid through taxation on an income-contingent basis. Each treasury worries about the mounting long-term cost of loan non-repayment and subsidised interest rates. Australia deregulated student numbers in 2012, and in 2015 the UK will follow, offering higher education places to all students qualified to enter. Each country provides a unitary system of universities with a common mission in teaching, research and service, competing fiercely for students and research support. In each country the combined outcome of historical inequalities and market forces is a steep hierarchy of higher education institutions (HEIs), informal but real. The most research-intensive universities are on top (the Russell Group in the UK, Group of Eight in Australia), with successive universities positioned below them at decreasing levels of research and prestige. In both countries further and vocational education sits below the universities, underfunded and lacking the prestige of second sectors in countries such as Germany. On the margins of higher education both UK and Australia subsidise private colleges through student loans, and the number of students in for-profit HEIs is growing. In both UK and Australia higher education has been reshaped by business models and a new emphasis on students as customers. Organisational cultures are like peas in a pod. Both systems run periodic research assessment exercises, like modern Domesday books, that have stepped up competition and internal mobility. There is also much movement of professors and executive leaders between the two countries. In a world in which cross-border student numbers are growing at twice the rate of domestic student populations, both the UK and Australia generate major export income as providers of English-language education, charging Asian and African students fees well above those paid by local students. In 2012-13 there were 425,265 foreign students (including EU students) in UK higher education and 230,923 in Australia. Both are multicultural with a traditional Anglo core, comfortable with foreign students but struggling with the politics of migration, creating tension with the education export industry. Tensions are greater in the UK, where the UK Independence party (Ukip) is riding high, but Australia has its share of white-is-right activists and shock-jock radio spruikers. The one difference between higher education in the UK and Australia is the geopolitics. The UK is at the edge of the EU and deciding whether it is European or not. Australia has an indigenous population under-represented in higher education. It is also at the edge of south-east Asia, and figuring out if it is British, continental \u2013 there are large heritage communities from Italy, Greece, the Balkans and Turkey \u2013 or Asian. Economically, demographically and culturally, the Asian element is growing fast. More than half of Australia&apos;s export trade, led by coal, iron ore, gold and education, is with China, Japan, Korea and other dynamic regional economies. Australia largely avoided the post-2008 recession because of its burgeoning trade with China. There has been little increase in unemployment. The largest source countries for migrants into Australia were once UK and Ireland. Now they are China and India. Malaysia and Indonesia are also important. Many Asian migrants start out as international students. More by luck than design the regional geopolitics are playing in Australia&apos;s favour. North-east Asia is now the most dynamic region in world higher education. Korea and Taiwan have near universal levels of tertiary participation. China&apos;s output of scientific papers is expanding by 16.5% a year. North-east Asia now spends more on research and development than the US and Canada combined, and 40% more than the UK/Europe. When China opened up to the world, Australia developed the relationship early. While UK researchers have primarily focused on collaboration with Europe, a major source of research funding, Australian universities have been building ties in Asia. Australia has higher rates of research collaboration in China, Taiwan and Singapore (though it is weaker in Korea) than the US. Among all the English-speaking nations, the UK has the lowest rates of research collaboration in dynamic Asia. Simon Marginson is professor of international higher education at the Institute of Education, London, and a professorial associate at the University of Melbourne, Australia. Australian and UK universities mimic each other&apos;s strategies when it comes to higher education funding and policy. But who&apos;s leading the way, and are they going in the right direction?

She had worked at the Center for Prevention of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault in Taitung for five years. As well as managing 120 cases, she had to be on call during the night and at weekends. She came down with a cold, but did not have time to see a doctor; her illness was complicated by myocarditis, which led to her death. Social workers, especially those who work in domestic violence and child protection, have complained for years about excessive workloads. Their labour rights are now an important issue in Taiwan. Social workers are supposed to report threats to their safety and health from clients, as well as the pressure to satisfy clients&apos; needs. The negative effects of work on the general health of social workers nationwide remain poorly understood. We explored social workers&apos; health in the first nationwide survey. Our study attempted to characterise the general health of Taiwanese social workers. More than 960 social workers completed a questionnaire that was posted online.  The primary finding was that social workers faced a variety of health-related difficulties. Of these, anxiety and insomnia were the most common. Additionally, social workers who are young, have little work experience, a low education level, are without a licence, unmarried, male or were employed part-time had the most health problems. After the survey was conducted, Taiwan Association of Social Workers held a series of symposiums around the country to share the results with social workers. The 254 workers who attended these events were asked whether their employers took measures to protect their health; only half reported that their employers did.  Two of the most common measures were to enhance psychological health by group work and providing individual services. A third measure was to hold courses to enhance the workers\u2019 professional competency, which was followed by help from supervisors and colleagues. In total, 12 different measures were taken by employers. The survey and suggestions from the symposiums showed that Taiwanese social workers had many occupational health issues and lacked support. As a result, we proposed a directive on health and safety at work for social workers in Taiwan.  We think the government should implement policies and budgets that encourage employers to implement work-related measures. We recommend that employers promote the occupational health of their staff through various means and evaluate outcomes periodically. Moreover, educators have the responsibility to design courses that help students understand the health risks they will face and increase their competency in dealing with issues. More evidence-based research on effective intervention is needed.  As the largest professional association for social workers in Taiwan, the TASW will continue advocating for social workers&apos; labour rights and their health at work.

And participants tended to value processed information more highly as well because of their perception that it gave a greater insight into their lifestyle. But interestingly personal information becomes even more highly valued in certain circumstances. For example, the study covered two unusual days. The first was a holiday in Italy known as the Immaculate Conception holiday. The second was a day of particularly high winds which caused multiple roadblocks and accidents. &quot;The median bids for all categories in these two days were significantly higher than for the rest of the days in the study,&quot; say Staiano and co. In other words, participants value their information more highly on days that are unusual compared to typical days.  \u20ac2 per day is over \u20ac700 annually. You can read the Arxiv paper.

Unbundling mobile apps for the emerging markets &gt;&gt; Lightspeed  I think unbundling is a strategy that has not yet been applied with vigor in the emerging markets on smartphones. I think there are potentially disproportionate advantages to be had by unbundling in countries like India, in the short- to medium-term. Why is this? Because low device memory limits (typically less than 16 Gb), low bandwidth limits (mostly 2G) and relatively high bandwidth prices result in dramatic drops in conversion rates, download success rates and retention rates as app size increases. Also, in my opinion, discovery on the app stores is easier when there is a single focused value prop (kind of the approach that Whatsapp has taken with a singular focus on messaging).  The graph of downloads against file size is persuasive. Tablet PC quarterly shipments fall for the first time, according to NPD DisplaySearch &gt;&gt; DisplaySearch  &quot;Tablet PC demand in 2014 is being affected by falling demand for the 7&quot; class in emerging regions and in China, where many local white-box brands have experienced lower-than-expected shipment growth,&quot; said Hisakazu Torii, vice president, smart application research at NPD DisplaySearch. &quot;Most major brands have recently reduced their business plans for 2014. There is a risk that the replacement cycle for tablet PCs will lengthen beyond the one to two year range unless brands can develop more attractive usage scenarios.&quot;  Forecasts declining notebook sales. The truth behind Apple&apos;s suppliers in China (Part 1) &gt;&gt; SonnyDickson  In Hua Qiang North Market, the heart of asia&apos;s electronics market, there is a building called YuanWang Digital Mall. There are dozens of iPhone 5 &amp; 6, iPads, and Macs such as Mac Mini&apos;s and Macbook&apos;s. These units vary from real, and fake units. All the real units and all their accessories are\u00a0 being showcased and traded throughout that mall, and later sold and distributed around the whole world. Almost all the goods there are smuggled goods from HK, due to 17% tax at China customs, so smuggling to avoid high tax is very very profitable. On May 27th, Shen Zhen Customs (Shenzhen anti-smuggling governing body), and Hua Qiang street authorities,\u00a0stormed the YuanWang Mall to try to catch some of those smugglers and whoever was said to sell Apple/Samsung/Nokia/etc units, or fake Apple/Samsung/Nokia units. More than 120 government officials are involved in this operation. Apple may have had a role in this raid, since Apple have the ability to track all serials &amp; activations between HK and China. There are 3 major smugglers and sellers who own 10 warehouses, 38 shops inside the mall, and around the area have been caught. During these operations more than 2 thousand people witnessed the whole raid, making it such a scene in the area.  A Statistical Comparison of the iOS and Android Stores &gt;&gt; ShinobiControls Website Colin Eberhardt:   A few months ago I published a blog post which showed the results of analysing the meta-data of 75,000 apps from the iTunes App Store. This analysis revealed some interesting results; 75% of apps are free, 60% have no ratings and the Entertainment category has the worst user ratings. This blog post continues the analysis by adding 60,000 Android apps into the mix. For those of you that like their information presented in tweet-sized portions, here are some quick results \u2022 The iOS store has 3.5x more business apps than the Android store, and 2x more Education apps.\u2022 Both stores have roughly the same number of free apps, at 75%\u2022 The most expensive category in the Android store is Medicine at $21 avg, which is double the most expensive iOS category, Business, with an average price of $12.\u2022 The average user rating of Android apps is slightly lower than iOS apps\u2022 The Apple store has 3x more apps with zero user ratings.  Would have been nice - with the Android apps (as it&apos;s not available for the iOS store) - would have been an analysis of the number of downloads. (Thanks @HotSoup for the link.)

Joy&apos;s notebook is about two inches thick, she&apos;s created an A-Z index for it, it is packed full of handwritten notes about how to do different tasks in the various system she uses \u2013 steps that need following, codes that need inputting. It sits beside her every day, beautifully decorated (with stickers) evidence of\u00a0the horrendous usability of the software she uses to get her job done. Joy has been working for this airline for\u00a0years. She told me that some of the stuff that is in her notebook\u00a0she doesn&apos;t need anymore \u2013 either because they&apos;ve upgraded to a new system or that, after years, she&apos;s finally managed to memorise it. She told me that each time they upgrade the system it seems to get harder, not easier, to use. Joy told me that all the customer service reps have a notebook like this. You can&apos;t use the systems without one. Joy is digitally literate and confident with the computer, but it is impossible to use without the notebook. Joy is frontline staff for a major international airline.  Trouble it, it&apos;s never Year Zero at an airline, so there&apos;s never a chance to start over afresh. Stop the JerkTech &gt;&gt; TechCrunch Josh Constine:   &quot;Go disr*pt yourself&quot; is what I have to say to founders of startups like ReservationHop and Parking Monkey. They&apos;re emblematic of a compassionless new wave of self-serving startups that exploit small businesses and public infrastructure to make a buck and aid the wealthy. Let&apos;s call these parasites #JerkTech. It&apos;s one thing to outcompete a big, stagnant company with new technology. It&apos;s another to screw over the little guys just because you can sell what&apos;s usually free. So what do these tools do? ReservationHop places phony reservations at the hottest San Francisco restaurants, and then sells them for $5 or $10 apiece on its site. That makes it harder for the common man to get a reservation, since if they call the restaurant directly, they&apos;ll find all the spots taken. And if ReservationHop doesn&apos;t sell the spots it stole? Tough luck for the restaurant, which just had a table go empty or wasted a half hour because the fake Dick Jerkson that ReservationHop put as the name on the res never showed up.  How Microsoft stops your Windows Phone getting certain features &gt;&gt; Neowin  beyond the annoying limitations of carriers and the realities of software development, there is a further mechanism that can - and in some cases, does - restrict the availability of certain Windows Phone features in particular markets. Documentation seen by Neowin, shown to us\u00a0by a source at one of Microsoft&apos;s hardware partners, describes how OEMs must comply with &quot;Embargos&quot; set by Microsoft, which may prohibit or restrict distribution or announcement of certain features within the Windows Phone OS. For example, on WindowsPhone.com, Microsoft says that Wi-Fi\u00a0Sense\u00a0- a feature that allows users to automatically connect to wireless networks, and share Wi-Fi details with trusted contacts - &quot;is not available in the following countries/regions: Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.&quot;  Not explained: why (beyond services that might just not be ready in some countries, eg Cortana/speech) Microsoft would do this. The spread of second-hand smartphones in Thailand/SE Asia &gt;&gt; Inside The Noodle Bowl Jon Russell went travelling and has some notes:   In no particular order: \u2022 Lots more people using iPhones (and to a lesser extent Samsung smartphones). What struck me most is that folks you wouldn&apos;t expect to have them \u2013 such as migrant workers in Bangkok, who catch the bus to back up-country on their breaks \u2013 have older devices, like the iPhone 4 or 3GS. All the usual apps, Line, Instagram, Facebook, etc are on-board (from what I&apos;ve seen) thanks to the fact that iOS supports older devices like no other platform. Unlikely that money is being spent, but very likely that users are highly-engaged and active (most have probably spent most of their time online in an Internet cafe). \u2022 Lots of folks with two phones. A feature phone for calling, and an older smartphone for games, apps and other computer-like activities. This is their version of an affordable tablet/computer, I guess, and feeds back to the above. \u2022 A great many smartphone users still evidently on pre-pay deals, as they toggle 3G data settings on/off. Also watched a number of people toggle location on/off, presumably to check-in on Facebook or Foursquare, while taking into account older devices have older batteries which drain quicker. \u2022 Most tablet usage appeared (at least from what I saw) to be among middle-class and upwards. Spotted more Galaxy Tabs than iPads, but not sure that is a country-wide trend.

The company is targeting businesses with the new plans, claiming to be ale to save their employees tens of thousands of dollars a month on international roaming charges. However, they will still have to pay for a data plan with a traditional mobile operator if they want to use Silent Phone over 3G or 4G networks, rather than just over Wi-Fi \u2013 so the promise of no roaming charges only goes so far. Silent Circle CEO Mike Janke told the Guardian the Global Encrypted Calling Plans would bring \u201cbeautiful disruption\u201d to the industry.  \u201cA customer can get a basic cheap data plan from any telco and use our encrypted calling plan for all 2G, 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi calling.

So I would imagine that much of the disintermediation of traditional operator voice calling has already happened,\u201d she added. \u201cAlso, in certain regions like the EU, roaming charges have come right down due to regulation, so it is only calls to very remote places where calling is still very costly.\u201d \u2022 Silent Circle: &apos;You may wish to avoid email altogether...&apos;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/10/academic-journal-retracts-articles-peer-review-ring", "publicationDate": "2014-07-10T16:14:21Z", "tags": ["Peer review and scientific publishing", "US press and publishing", "Controversies", "Science", "Academic experts", "US news", "World news", "Education", "US education", "Higher education", "Media"], "sentences": ["The journal\u2019s publisher, Sage, said in a statement that the ring appeared to centre around Peter Chen, a researcher formerly of National Pingtung University of Education, in Taiwan."], "title": "Academic journal retracts articles over 'peer review ring' with bogus scholars", "article": "An academic journal has retracted dozens of articles and apologised to readers after falling victim to what it described as a \u201cpeer review ring\u201d that appears to have involved more than 100 bogus scholars.

As more people are impacted by natural hazards due to the impact of climate change and other factors, disaster recovery takes longer and costs more. As governments propose more personal accountability and community resilience, and better planning, affected communities are increasingly challenged in long-term disaster recovery and reconstruction. A symposium at the Joint World Conference on Social Work, Education and Social Development in Melbourne will present the results of an international partnership study on rebuilding lives post-disaster and share innovative community practices for sustainable development.   The study brought together a team of social work researchers, collaborators and partners to consider community-based disaster recovery practices in six countries \u2013 Canada, Australia, USA, India, Pakistan, and Taiwan.   The partnership approach allowed for shared learning and resources by comparing experiences at local and international levels.  Building on a previous study that considered the need for long-term disaster recovery in post-tsunami south India, the research partnership brought together co-investigators in the six countries and the UK. Each researcher had formal partnerships with community groups, non-profit organisations, government agencies and disaster recovery organisations. It is crucial to develop new knowledge grounded in communities&apos; experiences of disaster recovery. The research team conducted more than 70 interviews with disaster responders, volunteers and officials who played a formal role in recovery, and 12 focus groups with more than 120 people affected by a disaster in their community.  Researchers asked how the community had changed since the disaster and considered the roles played by government, disaster management and emergency preparedness, social work and social services in post-disaster activities, and discussed the role of gender, health, education and school infrastructure, and the impact of climate change.  The research aims to address longer-term disaster reconstruction challenges by exploring understandings of sustainability, equity and livelihood options among affected communities engaged in post-disaster reconstruction work; and to advance knowledge of community-based disaster mitigation strategies by compiling case studies on emergent best practice, policies, and lessons learned. The experience of Volusia County, Florida In 2004 and 2005, the area of Volusia County in central Florida absorbed the force of several strong hurricanes.  Volusia County is an agricultural area, comprised of several highly vulnerable populations. Qualitative methods were used to collect data on topics of community-based disaster preparedness and recovery strategies in the county, particularly among women and limited English proficient populations.   Results suggest that social networks were used by these vulnerable groups to mobilise local resources to promote sustainable recovery. A prime benefit to rural communities is the close-knit sense of mutual support that led to the creation of Alianza de Mujeres Activas (Alliance of Active Women). This group of women volunteers, most speaking limited English, was instrumental in helping distribute essential items such as water, food and first aid, and important information post-disaster to immigrant and migrant families.   Social workers and disaster service organisations can benefit by building trust with local groups such as AMA to aid in sustainable recovery efforts.  Our symposium event at the conference will share the results of the study, discussing what is known to work and what is challenging in long-term disaster recovery. The importance of community-led recovery and involving locals in decision-making processes will also be highlighted.  Social workers can play a potentially key role in disaster recovery by facilitating community development, restoring livelihoods, providing psychosocial support, and building capacity in local communities. There is also a need to build capacity in the social work profession for the integration of social, economic and environmental dimensions in policy and practice, and to develop curricula to better prepare social workers for the challenges ahead. The conference in Melbourne will also see the launch of an invitation to the global social work community to refine approaches to disaster response internationally, in order to support the development of a further partnership study.

Roku is top US streaming media player &gt;&gt; Advanced Television  The report \u2013 The Evolving Market For Streaming Media Devices \u2013 found Roku accounted for nearly one-half of streaming media players (46%) purchased in the US in 2013, while Apple, its closest competitor, had 26%. Roku is also the most-used streaming media player in the US. Among US broadband households with a streaming media player, 44% use a Roku player the most versus 26% that use Apple TV the most. The gap has widened since 2013, when 37% of streaming media player owners used Roku most and 24% used Apple TV most. &quot;Multiple factors have allowed Roku to outpace Apple in US sales and usage,&quot; said Barbara Kraus, director, research, Parks Associates. &quot;Roku has always had a close association with Netflix, the largest source of video downloads, and currently offers more than 1,700 channel apps as well as a choice of models with different features and price points, all of which appeal to consumers&apos; purchasing instincts. With Amazon entering this CE category, there will be renewed pressure on all players to develop the best combination of &apos;can&apos;t miss&apos; content with a simple and intuitive interface.&quot; The CE category for streaming media players has been robust despite competition from streaming &apos;sticks&apos; such as the Google Chromecast. According to Parks Associates&apos; 1Q 2014 survey of 10,000 US broadband households, Google Chromecast sold as many units in six months as Roku sold in 2013, but overall, usage of the Chromecast has steadily declined since its introduction.  FTC alleges Amazon unlawfully billed parents for millions of dollars in children&apos;s unauthorised in-app charges &gt;&gt; Federal Trade Commission The FTC is filing a complaint in federal court:   According to the complaint, kids&apos; games often encourage children to acquire virtual items in ways that blur the lines between what costs virtual currency and what costs real money. In the app &quot;Ice Age Village,&quot; for example, the complaint noted that children can use &quot;coins&quot; and &quot;acorns&quot; to buy items in the game without a real-money charge. However, they can also purchase additional &quot;coins&quot; and &quot;acorns&quot; using real money on a screen that is visually similar to the one that has no real-money charge. The largest quantity purchase available in the app would cost $99.99. The complaint highlights internal communications among Amazon employees as early as December 2011 that said allowing unlimited in-app charges without any password was &quot;\u2026clearly causing problems for a large percentage of our customers,&quot; adding that the situation was a &quot;near house on fire.&quot;  The FTC previously sued Apple (and won a settlement). The rise of thin, mini and insert skimmers &gt;&gt; Krebs on Security Brian Krebs on the systems criminals put into ATMs to collect magnetic stripe data:   Like most electronic gadgets these days, ATM skimmers are getting smaller and thinner, with extended battery life. Here&apos;s a look at several miniaturized fraud devices that were pulled from compromised cash machines at various ATMs in Europe so far this year. According to a new report from the European ATM Security Team (EAST), a novel form of mini-skimmer was reported by one country. Pictured below is a\u00a0device designed to capture the data stored on an ATM card&apos;s magnetic stripe as the card is inserted into the machine. While most card skimmers are made to sit directly\u00a0on top of the existing card slot, these newer mini-skimmers fit snugly inside the card reader throat, obscuring most of the device. This card skimmer was made to fit inside certain kinds of cash machines made by NCR.  Smartwatches blur outlook for Google Glass &gt;&gt; WSJ  Glass will face tough comparisons against smartwatches. Though made for different body parts, both products are designed primarily to give users a quicker way to get information or check messages without taking out their phones. For example, Google says notifications in smartphone apps will show up on both Android-powered watches and Glass. Watches will be much cheaper. Glass costs $1,500 today, though the price is expected to drop over time. Samsung Electronics&apos;s new Android smartwatch, the Gear Live, costs $199. Watches will also offer more apps for now. Glass has only 67 apps as Google strives to get software developers to design apps that take advantage of the eyewear&apos;s features. One such app, Livestream, broadcasts live video from Glass&apos;s built-in camera. Getting an app approved for Glass can be time-consuming\u2014some developers at Google&apos;s conference said it can take months. By contrast, smartwatch apps are typically approved in about 90 minutes. \u2026&quot;In consumer markets, Glass will require a lot of cultural engineering,&quot; said Forrester research analyst J.P.

I couldn&apos;t find the EDN source, but assuming for a moment it&apos;s reliable, the contrast with 2013 (and the GS4) is thought-provoking:   Samsung Electronics revises its orders for parts and components used for making the Galaxy S4 by a third, for the next quarter this year. According to an industry source the parts and component orders will be enough for production of 20-25 million units of Galaxy S4 in the second quarter and 20m units in the third quarter, the sources indicated.  20m flagships in Q3 2013, but only 15m in Q3 2014? EC distorts market by refusing to break free from lock-in &gt;&gt; Free Software Foundation  In April, the Commission signed two contracts with Microsoft: An agreement for &quot;high-level services&quot; worth \u20ac44m, and a framework agreement on software licensing conditions.

The contracts cover the Commission itself, and 54 other EU organisations.  &quot;We are extremely disappointed about the lack of progress here,&quot; says FSFE president Karsten Gerloff. &quot;The Commission has not even looked for viable alternatives. Its lazy approach to software procurement leaves the Commission open to allegations of inertia, and worse.&quot;  The Commission recently admitted publicly for the first time that it is in &quot;effective captivity&quot; to Microsoft. But documents obtained by FSFE show that the Commission has made no serious effort to find solutions based on Open Standards. In consequence, a large part of Europe&apos;s IT industry is essentially locked out of doing business with the Commission.  &quot;A large part is locked out&quot;? Rumour: Google prepping Play Store with device-specific app restoration options &gt;&gt; Android Police  The new restoration process will apparently be part of the Play Store app itself, and would allow users to choose from a list of backups from their other devices, so if you&apos;re setting up the Play Store on a new (or freshly wiped) phone, you could choose to restore a backup from a phone, thereby restoring all your phone-specific apps and eschewing the apps you use only on tablets or other devices. Our information also indicates there may be an option to add on individual apps to the backup you choose.What isn&apos;t clear right now is exactly what is meant by data. Of course restoring actual app data between devices would be a boon for Android users, but it&apos;s just as likely that the new feature is using &quot;data&quot; in the same vague way as the current setup process.  A hugely welcome step, if overdue; Apple&apos;s iCloud backup has done this for years. (Then again, the absence of this feature principally affects people who replace their phone often - which most people don&apos;t.)

There are a lot of non-native species \u2013 such as signal crayfish \u2013 that are running riot here in Britain and decimating certain native animals.&quot; But, he says, even though this small nation has challenges we are lucky to have such a well-informed public: &quot;The young people in this country are far more aware of the environment than I ever was when I was a kid \u2013 it&apos;s something that&apos;s much more on the agenda.&quot; It is not surprising then, that when frequently asked what he thinks the planet\u2019s most deadly animal is, Backshall\u2019s answer is always the same.  \u201cIt is us, by a mile. There&apos;s no other species on earth that destroys the environment it relies on to survive. We are more destructive and more pervasive than any other animal. If you took us away from the planet right now the result would be wonderful, and there is pretty much nothing else you could say that about.\u201d As such a well-known wildlife expert, Backshall believes adamantly that it is his duty to highlight these critical issues \u2013 as long as he is pragmatic about it.  \u201cFirst and foremost, it&apos;s about making people love animals, wildlife and nature, and then secondly, getting the message in by stealth,\u201d an approach that has proven to be effective in the past. Many of his programmes highlighting the issues facing sharks today have been broadcast in China, Taiwan, Indonesia, and the Philippines, or as he says, \u201cthe countries where that really matters\u201d. \u201cThose programmes have the thrill of the encounter and the thrill of me looking like I&apos;m about to get eaten by a great white shark, so people watch them regardless of whether they would be interested in the message,\u201d he says. \u201cBut two minutes later I can say to them: \u2018So this wonderful animal you&apos;ve just seen is in danger because of this ...\u2019 and even if I only get a minute to pass that message on, it has been heard by people who otherwise wouldn&apos;t listen to it.\u201d It is these types of approaches, and initiatives such as the No Limits? campaign, that Steve hopes will signal the difference between people cowering behind the sofa, and striding out to make sure something is done. &quot;There has to be a belief that we can do something definitive about it. There&apos;s nothing more paralysing or more likely to make people fall into a malaise of believing they are powerless than just hearing that everything&apos;s negative and everything&apos;s shot to bits. It&apos;s really important that we know we can change this planet for the better and that every single one of us, no matter how small we may feel, has that power.\u201d Interested in finding out more about how you can live better?

But last week German researchers put more weight on the latter, saying that the longer people stay in education, the higher the risk of short-sightedness. In the study in Ophthalmology of 4,658 people aged between 35 and 74 years of age, half of those who were university graduates were myopic, compared with 34% of non-graduates. Short-sightedness usually starts in childhood and teenage years and is increasing worldwide. In some parts of Asia, up to 80-90% of school leavers need glasses. The increase has been so rapid that genetic changes can&apos;t be solely to blame. A study in Birmingham in 2011 found that 9.4% of children between the ages of six and seven and nearly 30% of those between 12 and 14 years of age were short-sighted. While glasses may be cooler these days, short-sightedness still isn&apos;t desirable. It carries risks in later years of conditions that can cause blindness. So can you reduce the likelihood of your child becoming short-sighted \u2013 other than by discouraging them from university? The solutionShort-sightedness may be caused by the eyeball developing a slightly longer shape than usual. Light is then focused in front of the retina instead of precisely on to it, making distant objects look blurry. Children who are short-sighted often complain of headaches, and may squint and blink and hold books right up to their eyes. Visual stress is thought to contribute to short-sightedness \u2013 hence the link between educational level and what researchers call &quot;near work&quot; (reading and writing). Studies over the past 10 years consistently show one thing might help: getting your child to spend more time outside. An Australian review found that children who spent time outdoors had a clearly reduced risk of short-sightedness. This protective effect reduced the influence of lots of near work or having short-sighted parents \u2013 so it wasn&apos;t just that children spent less time on near work. Ultraviolet light may encourage the pupils in the eyes to constrict and increase the depth of focus and reduce blurring, or it may increase dopamine release, which may reduce lengthening of the eyeball. It does not seem to matter what children do outdoors \u2013 a picnic may be as good as a game of football. The amount of time is also unclear, although a review from the University of Cambridge found that an increase of an hour a week outdoors was associated with a 2% reduction in the odds of developing short-sightedness. Their review found that children with myopia spent 3.7 fewer hours per week outside compared with those not affected. Meanwhile, a study in Taiwan found benefits to spending 80 minutes a day outdoors. So, encouraging your children to be outdoors has something else to recommend it."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/jul/14/retractions-journal-publishers-scientific-papers-peer-review", "publicationDate": "2014-07-14T11:47:02Z", "tags": ["Peer review and scientific publishing", "Science", "Research", "Higher education", "Education", "Controversies"], "sentences": ["News that Peter Chen, an engineering researcher in Taiwan, managed to game the peer review system and sneak into print at least 60 publications in a single journal is certain to raise serious questions about the integrity of the process by which scientific publishers vet papers."], "title": "Retractions are coming thick and fast: it's time for publishers to act | Adam Marcus  and Ivan Oransky", "article": "News that Peter Chen, an engineering researcher in Taiwan, managed to game the peer review system and sneak into print at least 60 publications in a single journal is certain to raise serious questions about the integrity of the process by which scientific publishers vet papers. Those doubts only get stronger when you consider that this wasn\u2019t the first time a scientist attempted such a scheme. In 2012, a Korean plant chemist was caught cheating the peer review process and was forced to retract 28 articles. (He had already retracted seven others for different reasons, making a total of 35.) The publishing giant Elsevier retracted 11 papers the same year after what it called a \u201chack\u201d of its editorial publishing system. The publisher Springer has also had at least two cases of retraction after it was discovered that the papers had been peer-reviewed by one of the authors. That\u2019s a total of more than 100 retractions for bogus peer review as a result of vulnerabilities in publishers\u2019 editorial systems. To be fair, this represents only a tiny fraction of roughly 1.4m articles published by science journals each year. But retractions for all reasons, from honest error to plagiarism to the outright faking of data, are on the rise. The number of retractions in the first decade of the 21st century was 10 times larger than that at the end of the 20th. And that doesn\u2019t include a couple of recent extremely high-volume recidivists, such as Chen, the Dutch social psychologist Diederik Stapel (with 54 retracted papers) and Yoshitaka Fujii, whose 183 or so retractions make him the worst known offender. What drives scientists to commit fraud? The common theme of many of these stories is that researchers felt great pressure to publish papers, and get them cited, because those are the currency of tenure and grants. It\u2019s unclear, however, as a 2013 study in the journal PLOS Medicine noted, whether the growth in retractions \u201creflects an increase in publication of flawed articles or an increase in the rate at which flawed articles are withdrawn&quot;. Not all of these take-backs could have been prevented with better peer review or stricter scrutiny from editors. But some of them could, whether by plagiarism screening programs such as CrossCheck, or even Google, which in our experience proves pretty useful as a first-pass system for identifying misused text. The problem is knottier when it comes to finding evidence of falsified results or doctored figures and images. Although the human eye isn\u2019t particularly good at catching dodgy images, emerging software can pick up signs of image manipulation such as reversal, rotation, duplication and other common tricks of the trade. These programs aren\u2019t quite ready for widespread use, but the time is coming. So what\u2019s to be done? No journal, either in print or online, has any excuse not to be using plagiarism detection tools on every manuscript it receives. The same should go for fledgling image detection systems when they become mature. Another encouraging development is the rise of post-publication peer review, which has been made possible in recent years by the availability of papers online. Contributors to PubPeer, for example, have found signs of flawed or falsified results, leading to papers being retracted. Some critics of PubPeer \u2013 which allows anonymous posting \u2013 and related sites have argued that they are little better than nests of libel. But PubPeer is in fact carefully moderated, and the results are hard to argue with. In one case from 2013, an article in the prestigious Journal of Biological Chemistry was pulled after a commenter on PubPeer raised questions about the images in the paper. And last month, the authors of a paper in Current Biology retracted their article in the wake of a flood of comments on PubPeer, and a university committee ruling that there had been image manipulation. The high-profile case of the two recently retracted stem cell papers from Nature, arguably the world\u2019s most prestigious science journal, demonstrated what may become a common narrative \u2013 and also a common attitude among editors. Nature tried to argue that although post-publication peer review had indeed uncovered serious problems with the paper, those problems weren\u2019t the ones that forced the retraction. The latter, they said, required a university investigation. On the surface, that\u2019s true. But there would have been no investigation had post-publication peer reviewers not caught the errors that Nature\u2019s peer reviewers had missed. Post-publication peer review needn\u2019t replace traditional peer review. Both are important. But if publishers don\u2019t begin to acknowledge the limitations of peer review, and fully embrace post-publication peer review \u2013 which, after all, better reflects the constant self-correction for which science wants to be known \u2013 you may be reading far more headlines about analyses in PubPeer than you do about papers in Nature or Science.

As air traffic control authorities banned all aircraft from flying through eastern Ukrainian airspace \u2013 which is likely to increase flight costs and journey times \u2013 it has emerged that several airlines had already chosen to avoid the area. A spokesman for Qantas said the Australian flag carrier had not used the route for months. Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific said it had been taking a detour for &quot;quite some time&quot;. British Airways, Korean Air Lines, Air Berlin, Asiana Airlines and Taiwan&apos;s China Airlines had also been avoiding the east Ukraine route - which is the most commonly used between Europe and Asia - for months. British Airways declined to comment on its previous flight routes. Eurocontrol, which manages the European air transport network, said MH17 was flying at approximately 33,000ft, 1,000ft above closed airspace. Since the crash, the Ukrainian authorities have completely closed airspace over eastern Ukraine, known in air traffic control terms as Dnipropetrovsk flight information region. &quot;All flight plans that are filed using these routes are now being rejected by Eurocontrol. The routes will remain closed until further notice,&quot; the agency said. The European Aviation Safety Agency issued a safety bulletin in conjunction with Eurocontrol and the UN&apos;s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) on 3 April, advising that Crimean airspace in southern Ukraine should be avoided. However, the directive did not apply to the airspace over Ukraine being used by flight MH17 when it was brought down. On Friday the ICAO stressed it was up to individual member states to declare unsafe areas of airspace. &quot;ICAO does not declare airspace safe or unsafe or undertake any other direct operational responsibilities with respect to civilian air services,&quot; said spokesman Anthony Philbin, according to a Reuters report. &quot;It is always the responsibility of our sovereign member states to advise other states of potential safety hazards,&quot; he said. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration issued any previous guidance about eastern Ukrainian airspace before flight MH17 was shot down, despite attacks on other aircraft in the erea in the past month. Malaysia&apos;s transport minister, Liow Tiong Lai, said: &quot;The airspace the aircraft was traversing was unrestricted. I think since it&apos;s an approved route it is safe and that&apos;s the reason why we have been using this route.&quot; Around 200-300 of the daily flights on the route had diverted elsewhere in recent months, according to FlightRadar24 data. However, about 100 aircraft a day from more than 60 different airlines were seen in the region over the past week. A Singapore Airlines jet from Copenhagen to Singapore was flying within 20 miles of flight MH17 at the time of the crash, according to the FlightRadar24 data. Philip Plantholt, of FlightRadar24, said: &quot;There were for sure commercial aircraft within a 25km radius.&quot; The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said airlines depended on governments and air traffic control authorities to advise which airspace was available for flight, and safety was carriers&apos; top priority. Nico Voorbach, president of the pilots&apos; body the European Cockpit Association, called on aviation authorities to take immediate measures to secure all flights in the region. John Strickland, an independent aviation consultant, said airlines selected routes based on cost efficiency, taking into account the effects on journey times of wind at high altitude. &quot;Safety is always first, airlines are certainly not wilfully putting their passengers and aircrew at risk,&quot; he said. &quot;Airlines pick routes known to be the most cost efficient and fastest in flying time, but that is all secondary to safety.&quot; Strickland said routes could vary by hundreds of miles each day depending on wind conditions. He said longer routes would not just increase fuel costs, which account for 30% of flight costs on average, but also play havoc with airline timetables. &quot;Longer flights will anger passengers, and mean that planes aren&apos;t in the right places at the right time, which can have knock-on effects around the world,&quot; he said. Geoff Dell, an accident investigation and safety specialist at CQ University in Australia, said airlines should not have chosen routes that flew over the area. &quot;It&apos;s blatantly obvious they shouldn&apos;t have been anywhere near it,&quot; Dell said. &quot;Any sort of unrest breaks out, civil wars or such, you change your flight path so that you don&apos;t have to go anywhere near it. Of course it comes at a cost, because you have to fly further.&quot; While airlines pick the routes for flights, pilots can refuse to accept specific route plans. Brent Spencer, director of the air traffic control programme at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona, told Bloomberg: &quot;The fact that the airspace is not restricted doesn&apos;t mean you don&apos;t need to give extra consideration. You might want to think twice about flying through an airspace where there&apos;s somebody shooting missiles.&quot; Tony Tyler, the CEO of the International Air Transport Association, which represents 240 airlines, said they relied on authorities for guidance. &quot;It is very similar to driving a car. If the road is open, you assume that it is safe. If it&apos;s closed you find an alternate route,&quot; he said. &quot;No airline will risk the safety of their passengers, crew and aircraft for the sake of fuel savings. Airlines depend on governments and air traffic control authorities to advise which air space is available for flight, and they plan within those limits.&quot; Elizabeth Quintana, senior research fellow for air power and technology and director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, said the diversion of all flights for the foreseeable future would have cost implications for airlines. &quot;Diverting flights will add to fuel and logistic costs for airlines, which already have very low profit margins,&quot; she said. &quot;Fuel makes a massive difference if planes have to make a massive detour.&quot; She said airlines&apos; costs dropped considerably when Nato forces secured Afghanistan, as they had previously taken big detours to avoid the area. &quot;As missile systems develop, and the Chinese and Russians sell them around the world, this problem is not going to go away,&quot; Quintana said. President Obama announced on Friday that A National Transportation Safety Board investigator and the FBI are going to the site of the Malaysia Airlines crash. However, it was unclear who is leading the investigation, or how the NTSB will even gain access to the crash scene. Around 30 investigators from the Organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe were turned away from the miles-long crash scene by pro-Russian separatists, Friday afternoon. The NTSB did not say when an investigator might leave for Ukraine."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/20/guardian-view-hong-kong-china-promises", "publicationDate": "2014-07-20T17:40:24Z", "tags": ["Hong Kong", "China"], "sentences": ["That would be a dismal development for Hong Kong and profoundly counterproductive for China, with serious consequences in Taiwan, Japan and south-east Asia."], "title": "The Guardian view on charges China is reneging on its Hong Kong promises | Editorial", "article": "China is headed for a bruising clash with democrats in Hong Kong over its increasingly routine interference in the city&apos;s affairs, its new emphasis on the limitations of the territory&apos;s autonomy and, above all, on the arrangements for the election of the territory&apos;s leader in 2017. This was when many hoped that the provisions for indirect election through which Beijing has maintained informal control over Hong Kong politics would fall away and all adults would be able to choose a new chief executive from an unrestricted field of candidates. Recent pronouncements by both Beijing and the Hong Kong government suggests this will not be allowed to happen, in spite of the huge demonstrations which have filled the streets and parks of the city over the summer. It is not impossible that serious violence could ensue, with some imagining that Chinese security forces  might have to be brought in. That would be a dismal development for Hong Kong and profoundly counterproductive for China, with serious consequences in Taiwan, Japan and south-east Asia. China&apos;s president, Xi Jinping, would be wise to soften his line. Britain, which retains certain legal and moral responsibilities for Hong Kong, should make it clear that he should do so, but has so far been evading the issue. Hong Kong is one of the world&apos;s great cities, a synthesis of British power, Scottish mercantile drive and Chinese intelligence, ingenuity and hard work. For most of its time under the British, it was run in a typically colonial way, with a technically efficient civil service flanked by committees of vetted local worthies to provide some quasi-democratic cover. The majority of its citizens, rich or poor, devoted themselves mainly to the business of making a living. This relatively quiescent community was probably what the Chinese expected to incorporate when they signed the Sino-British joint declaration in 1984. The declaration started the process which led to the handover of the city to the People&apos;s Republic in 1997, but, ironically, from the point of view of Beijing, it did so as Hong Kong began to flower politically and culturally. Its economy emerged from the sweatshop era, its universities expanded, its people began to travel and settle abroad and its middle class grew in numbers and sophistication. It saw cities such as Sydney, Melbourne, Vancouver and Seattle, where many of its young people went for their education, as its peers, and as models for its future. Britain&apos;s last governor, Christopher Patten, understood these changes and tried, to the obvious irritation of the Chinese, to accommodate them. In the beginning the Chinese leaders probably saw the bargain behind the joint declaration more as between communism and capitalism than between one-party rule and democracy in the western sense. Hong Kong capitalists could get on with their job of making lots of money \u2013 although much more of it would end up in Beijing coffers than before \u2013 while Beijing would leave them alone, along with various quaint local customs, as long as they behaved in a &quot;patriotic&quot; way. But Hong Kong had moved on, as had China itself. Hong Kong&apos;s democracy movement had roots in earlier attempts to get more representation in the British colony, but was also connected to reform aspirations on the broader Chinese stage, aspirations which were crushed or, at the very least, postponed by the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. It is symptomatic of the &quot;delicate situation&quot; which China then faced in Hong Kong that the annual Tiananmen commemoration in Victoria Park has become a powerful statement of identity and difference, and a way in which young people align themselves with the Chinese dissidents and liberals who try to keep the democratic cause alive in the People&apos;s Republic itself. Clearly, unless and until democratic change in China and Hong Kong converge, there will be tension between Beijing and Hong Kong. But, as Lord Patten has said, that does not mean confrontation is unavoidable. Indeed, it makes it even more important that it be avoided, and Britain should publicly say so."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jul/22/does-multimillion-dollar-chinese-investment-signal-detroits-rebirth", "publicationDate": "2014-07-22T11:11:35Z", "tags": ["Cities", "US news", "China", "Real estate", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Chen, who was born in Taiwan but has lived in Michigan for decades, works for RE/MAX Crown Properties in the affluent suburb of Troy, and she has become the go-to resource for Chinese investors looking to buy up Detroit real estate."], "title": "Does multimillion dollar Chinese investment signal Detroit\u2019s rebirth?", "article": "Last autumn, a group of Chinese real estate developers arrived in downtown Detroit for a city tour.

In September, the Shanghai-based developer Dongdu International (DDI) made its first move. In an online auction, it snapped up three iconic downtown properties, all built during the city\u2019s early 20th-century heyday as an industrial powerhouse. DDI purchased the David Stott building, a 38-storey art-deco skyscraper built in 1929, and the former Detroit Free Press newspaper headquarters, a T-shaped edifice adorned with bas-relief sculptures of biplanes and locomotives. Later, it acquired the 10-storey Clark Lofts, an inconspicuous residential building with a manual, pre-second world war elevator \u2013 the oldest in Detroit.  Altogether, DDI spent $16.4m (\u00a39.6m) on the properties, slightly more than a top-market apartment in Shanghai. The company plans to transform the buildings into vibrant offices and upscale apartments, according to the CEO of DDI\u2019s leisure branch, Peter Wood. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve shown to the locals in Detroit that we\u2019re deadly serious, then other things will happen,\u201d Wood says, sitting in his corner office on the 10th floor of a Shanghai skyscraper, a dozen or so Chinese employees typing diligently in cubicles outside. \u201cDetroit is planning for this area to come back.

Not surprisingly, DDI has run into problems with its investments: the 302,000 sq ft Detroit Free Press building, abandoned since 1998, has fallen into an advanced state of disrepair. After DDI took over the David Stott building, its best-known tenant, Detroit Yoga, relocated citing landlord concerns. One of the building\u2019s only other tenants, SkyBar, is currently suing DDI over a rent dispute. Neither DDI nor SkyBar\u2019s management would comment on the case. \u201cThey had these grand plans to dump millions into the [Stott] building,\u201d Ryan Snoek, a real estate consultant who coordinated the sale, told Crains Business Detroit. \u201cI&apos;m starting to become concerned that may not be the case, that they just bought the buildings and will just hold on to it.\u201d Ken Creighton, a local representative for DDI, said the company will be begin renovating the buildings in the \u201cfirst or second quarter\u201d of next year. &quot;We&apos;ll do the Free Press building first ... All of the buildings will be redone \u2013 their mechanical, electrical and plumbing, their elevators. Most of these buildings haven\u2019t had anything done to them in years, maybe decades.\u201d     The SkyBar, in the David Stott building, is suing new owner DDI in a rent dispute. Photograph: Jon Kaiman    Soon after Detroit declared bankruptcy last July, China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV ran a special report claiming that Detroit properties were selling for less than a pair of leather shoes. Immediately, real estate broker Caroline Chen\u2019s phone began ringing off the hook. Chen, who was born in Taiwan but has lived in Michigan for decades, works for RE/MAX Crown Properties in the affluent suburb of Troy, and she has become the go-to resource for Chinese investors looking to buy up Detroit real estate. Three years ago, she opened a second office in Shanghai. Chen says that she still receives countless calls from curious Chinese buyers, five to 10% of which eventually end in transactions. Altogether, her firm has sold about 300 homes to Chinese clients, most for between $500 and $10,000. Many of them don\u2019t understand how bleak much of Detroit has become. \u201cMost buyers, on a small scale, they think they can leave the property sitting there, and since everybody\u2019s buying, its value will go up,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that\u2019s wrong. If everybody does that, then everything just sits there.\u201d In June 2014, one Chinese developer flew to Detroit to explore the possibility of building a Detroit Chinatown. \u201cMost of what I told him was negative, but that didn\u2019t scare him,\u201d Chen said. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s because Detroit\u2019s bad, that\u2019s why I want to develop,\u2019 he told me. \u2018We have seen so many examples of this \u2013 just look at Pudong in Shanghai.\u2019\u201d Two decades ago, the city\u2019s Pudong district was mostly marshland. Now, it\u2019s home to some of the most expensive real estate in the world. DDI\u2019s Detroit investments seem more calculated. The company already maintains properties in Shanghai, Nanjing, Chengdu, and California. It\u2019s also building a resort in Nova Scotia. Li Hailin, its 51-year-old chairman, has hosted government officials from Detroit\u2019s Wayne County at his home in central Shanghai. Li quit a government job at the age of 26 to become an entrepreneur in Shenzhen, the site of China\u2019s first experiments in free market capitalism. He made his fortune building migrant worker dorms.     The Pudong development zone in Shanghai. Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images    \u201cOur chairman sees a lot of things that other businesses don\u2019t \u2013 or don\u2019t want to try,\u201d says Solomon Wong, DDI\u2019s business manager for international projects. On a rainy day in March, Wong walks through a new row of 16-storey residential buildings in Shanghai\u2019s far-flung suburbs. DDI finished building them three years ago, he says; already, they are almost fully occupied. The complex is porcelain themed \u2013 at its centre is a small museum, featuring copies of ceramic masterpieces under glass display cases. Its walls are lined with photographs of other DDI properties \u2013 a gleaming commercial centre and a row of houses along a canal.  \u201cWe need to follow the rules of historical protection on these first few projects in Detroit,\u201d Wong says. \u201cBut for other projects, later, we could possibly build these kinds of things.\u201d The company has ambitions beyond real estate: DDI could soon bring Chinese auto industry savvy to the midwest, he says. China, in turn, could someday benefit from Michigan\u2019s celebrated universities and healthcare system. Analysts and competitors said that the firm would fail in Shenzhen, and then in Shanghai, according to Wong. Again and again, Dongdu has proved them wrong.

The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said conditions on Penghu, an island between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, had been suitable for incoming flights. The crash left wreckage tangled in the remains of a badly damaged building. The flight had taken off from Kaohsiung, in the south of Taiwan, bound for Penghu&apos;s Magong airport. Two people aboard the plane were French citizens and the rest Taiwanese, said the transport minister, Yeh Kuang-shih. The plane had been carrying 58 passengers and crew. The Taiwanese president, Ma Ying-jeou, said via a spokesman that it was &quot;a very sad day in the history of Taiwanese aviation&quot;. Jean Shen, director general of the CAA, said Magong air traffic controllers had lost contact with the flight during its go-around, when it was around 300 feet above the ground. She added that two flights had arrived safely just before GE222. Taiwan&apos;s Central News Agency (CNA) reported that the pilot had been asked to wait until 7.06pm before being allowed to make his first attempt at landing. It is not clear what caused the delay or why his initial attempt failed. The twin engine turboprop ATR-72 was due to take off at 4pm and arrive at Magong at 4.35pm, but did not leave Kaohsiung until 5.45pm, according to CNA. It was another hour and 20 minutes before it made its initial landing attempt. The country&apos;s Aviation Safety Council called an emergency meeting to look into the cause of the accident. Its head, Wang Hsing-chung, told CNA it was unclear whether bad weather or human error was to blame. In its statement TransAsia Airways said it was providing assistance to passengers and their families. It had also begun assisting the CAA and ASC investigation. It added that the plane had been in use for 13 years. It was in the hands of pilot Lee Yi-liang, who had 22 years of experience and almost 23,000 flying hours on his record, and co-pilot Chiang Kuan-hsing, who had two and a half years of flying experience and just under 2,400 hours. The flight had 54 passengers and four crew on board. According to the Flightradar24 website TransAsia Airways had cancelled almost all of its flights on Wednesday, presumably because of the bad weather. The defence department dispatched 200 troops to the scene to assist, Taiwan&apos;s Now News reported. Kaohsiung municipal government told Now News it had been in touch with TransAsia and requested the detailed list of passengers and crew members. A team from the CAA, aviation experts and relatives of the victims are due to fly to Magong on Thursday. Taiwan&apos;s weather agency said typhoon Matmo had brought gusts of up to 67mph (108km/h) as it blew through on Wednesday, knocking out power to more than 30,000 homes, before moving towards south-east China. Forecasters had warned heavy rains would continue into the evening. On the mainland, Fujian province officials said they had evacuated 300,000 people, but the typhoon weakened to a tropical storm as it reached the area. In 2000, 83 of the 179 on board a Singapore Airlines flight died when it attempted to take off from the wrong runway at Taipei&apos;s Chiang Kai-shek international airport as a typhoon approached. In 1998, a China Airlines jet a China Airlines jet from Bali failed in a first attempt to land at Taipei because of rain and fog, then stalled during the go-round and crashed into houses. All 196 on board and seven people on the ground died. In 2002 all 225 people on board a China Airlines flight died when it crashed en route from Taipei to Hong Kong in good weather.

Yes. Completely, totally and entirely irrational. You are probably not going to die in an airplane crash. It&apos;s a widespread fear after planes go down, even though the truth is that air travel is almost always boringly safe and uneventful (whether we concentrate on major US airlines or other carriers around the world). The latest global airline safety report shows there were 90 commercial airplane accidents in 2013. Only nine involved fatalities \u2013 a total of 173 people.  These deaths might initially seem to you like large figures \u2013 or make the nearly 350 fatalities in the last week between MH17 and the TransAsia tragedy (and hopefully not more) sound enormous \u2013 but you are missing crucial context: there were around 32m airline departures in 2013, according to the figures from the International Civil Aviation Organization. That means that fewer than one flight in 300,000 had an accident, and only one in 3,000,000 was fatal. So, if flying probably won&apos;t kill you, what actually might? Bear with me here. (There are one to three bear-related deaths per year in the US). For one, the fear of dying in a plane crash might actually kill you. For instance, in the wake of the 9/11 air tragedy, huge numbers of Americans switched from flying to driving \u2013 for the year following the attack, airline passenger miles fell between 12% and 20% while road use surged. Eventually Americans returned to the skies \u2013 but not all of them, tragically, were alive to do so, because driving long distances is much more dangerous than flying \u2013 indeed, because the increased road use may have led to more accidents. Professor Gerd Gigerenzer, a German academic, estimated that the road death toll in the year after 9/11 increased by 1,595 people. As far as transportation is concerned, by far the riskiest way to go anywhere is to take a motorcycle. Mile-for-mile (which is not an entirely fair comparison, as we generally fly further than we bike), motorcycling is more than 3,000 times more deadly than flying. Travelling in a car or truck is about 100 times more deadly than flying. Travelling by train can end up a little less grisly \u2013 it&apos;s only twice as deadly, mile-for-mile, as flying. Overall, fewer than 2% of US deaths are transportation-related. Whichever way you slice the figures (1,589 people were killed in the US in knife-related homicides in 2013), you&apos;re probably not going to die in a plane crash \u2013 as the saying goes, lightning tends not to strike twice (though it did cause 23 US deaths in 2013 and an estimated 6,000-24,000 worldwide).  But you are, tragically, going to die. Last year, around 55m people died worldwide, which means that, globally, 7.9 people out of every 1,000 die in any given year (a rate that is lower in industrialized countries due to better health and medicine). You&apos;re just unlikely to die travelling \u2013 by far, the two things most likely to kill you are heart disease and cancer.  So while the 777 you&apos;re flying on won&apos;t end your life, the peanuts you eat on board just might (4,600 Americans a year die from choking and obesity contributes to at least 110,000 preventable deaths a year in the US). It&apos;s just that plane fatalities are sort of a man-bites-dog story (whereas the 32 Americans who died of dog bites last year were not). \u2022 This article was updated to reflect the emerging details of Air Alg\u00e9rie flight AH5017."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/how-common-are-plane-crashes", "publicationDate": "2014-07-24T16:20:01Z", "tags": ["Air transport", "UK news", "World news"], "sentences": ["There have been three aviation disasters in the last week: the shooting down last Thursday of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine, killing all 283 passengers and 15 crew, the crashing of TransAsia Airways flight GE222 while trying to land at a Taiwanese airport on Wednesday, killing 48 and injuring 10, and the crashing today of Air Alg\u00e9rie flight AH5017\u202c from Burkino Faso to Algiers, which was carrying 110 passengers and six crew members."], "title": "How common are plane crashes?", "article": "There have been three aviation disasters in the last week: the shooting down last Thursday of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine, killing all 283 passengers and 15 crew, the crashing of TransAsia Airways flight GE222 while trying to land at a Taiwanese airport on Wednesday, killing 48 and injuring 10, and the crashing today of Air Alg\u00e9rie flight AH5017\u202c from Burkino Faso to Algiers, which was carrying 110 passengers and six crew members. It seems as though such crashes are happening very frequently at present \u2013 but, statistically, how common are plane crashes? Last year, while more than 3 billion people flew safely on 36.4 million flights, there were 81 aviation accidents, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). That was below the five-year average of 86 accidents per year, and the equivalent of one accident per 2.4 million flights. Last year, while more than 3 billion people flew safely on 36.4 million flights, there were 81 aviation accidents, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata). That was below the five-year average of 86 accidents per year. (Iata says that for western-built jet aircraft, there were 0.41 &quot;hull loss&quot; accidents per million flights in 2013, equivalent to one such accident per 2.4m flights; a &quot;hull loss&quot; is an accident in which the aircraft is destroyed or substantially damaged and not subsequently repaired). Only 20% of the 81 accidents recorded by Iata last year caused fatalities; there were 210 fatalities from commercial aviation accidents in 2013, a reduction from the 414 people who lost their lives in 2012 \u2013 despite there being a record low of 75 accidents that year.  There were 490 deaths in 2011 and a total of 92 accidents. There was a much higher figure of 786 fatalities in 2010, and 94 accidents. In 2009, there were 685 fatalities and 90 accidents.  This year&apos;s high-profile disasters have put the number of fatalities for 2014 at above 700 already \u2013 indicating that this is a particularly bad year for air crashes.  Nevertheless, flying has become safer over the last two decades. Between 2001 and 2010 the accident rate was cut by 42%, and two decades ago there were around 2,000 deaths and 250 crashes per year.  The single worst aviation disaster in history before 9/11 was the 1977 Tenerife airport disaster, in which 583 people were killed in a runway collision between two Boeing 747s at Los Rodeos Airport. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 July 2014.

Flight AH5017 operated by Air Alg\u00e9rie vanished from radar screens around 50 minutes after taking off from Burkina Faso en route to Algiers. It had reportedly asked to divert from its planned course because of heavy rain and poor visibility over northern Mali. Early on Friday authorities in Mali and Burkina Faso said wreckage had been found on Malian territory scattered and burned, with no survivors. The office of the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, later made the same announcement, saying the plane lay in pieces but had been positively identified. &quot;A French military unit has been sent to secure the site and gather the first elements of information,&quot; said a statement from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. Malian state television said the plane crashed between the town of Gossi, about 30 miles (50km) from the Burkina Faso border. Reports of the discovery were repeated by government officials in both countries and by Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, the president of Mali. There had been reports of massive sandstorms in the region before the plane disappeared shortly after changing course. It was not thought to have transmitted any distress signal. Officials in Burkina Faso, Algeria and France said no hypotheses were being ruled out, including a terrorist bombing or hijack, but seriously doubted that the Islamist forces and militias in northern Mali possessed surface-to-air missiles powerful enough to shoot down the plane. Almost half the passengers on board, 51 people, were reported to be French.     Locator map of where AH5017 disappeared    The three airliner crashes in the last week have claimed nearly 450 lives. Seven days ago Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 on board \u2013 including 193 Dutch citizens, 10 Britons, four Germans, four Belgians as well as dozens of Malaysians, Australians and Indonesians. On Wednesday a TransAsia Airways flight in Taiwan crashed in bad weather, killing 48 passengers including two French exchange students. Two French Mirage-2000 planes on Thursday searched the area where the Algeria-bound aircraft was thought to have crashed: the largely inaccessible region of Gao in northern Mali. Tension between various armed groups and militia, including Islamic extremists and Tuaregs, is high in the area. Its capital, Gao city, is on the river Niger about 190 miles south-east of Timbuktu. The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, summoned key ministers to a crisis meeting on Thursday afternoon, postponing a planned visit to France&apos;s Indian Ocean territories. He said &quot;all military and civilian means&quot; in the region of the crash would be mobilised to establish its cause. France has 1,600 troops in Mali as part of Operation Serval, which started at the beginning of last year and is aimed at ousting Islamist militants in the north of the country. Hollande said: &quot;My thoughts are with the anguished families and friends waiting at airports and express our solidarity, the solidarity of the nation. It is a moment of pain for the families and friends of 116 people, 51 of whom are our compatriots. We are in a series [of crashes] but there is no series because every situation is different \u2026 we have to establish what happened.&quot; Laurent Fabius, the foreign minister, said the aircraft had &quot;probably crashed&quot;. &quot;The search is concentrated on a vast part of Malian territory around Gao. Our forces in the region, including medical units, have been mobilised.&quot; He said that if the crash were confirmed it would be &quot;a major tragedy that has hit our whole nation and others&quot;. The plane, a McDonnell Douglas 83, had taken off from the Burkina Faso capital of Ouagadougou and was supposed to take a direct route to Algiers. Air traffic controllers lost contact with the aircraft, owned by the Spanish company Swiftair, at 0117 GMT, but its disappearance was not made public until several hours after its 0410 GMT scheduled arrival time in the Algerian capital. On Thursday evening, hours after the plane&apos;s disappearance, the exact identity of the passengers was still shrouded in confusion. French media reported that Zoheir Houaoui of Air Alg\u00e9rie had confirmed the plane was carrying 50 French passengers, six Algerians, one Malian, one Belgian, two from Luxembourg, five Canadians, one from Cameroon, four Germans, one Nigerian, eight Lebanese, one Romanian, 24 from Burkina Faso and six so far unidentified passengers. The six crew members \u2013 two pilots and four stewards \u2013 were all Spanish.

Photograph: Oli Scarff/PA    Six months ago the Guardian struggled to find politicians interested in campaigning against female genital mutilation (FGM). This week, David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Theresa May attended a summit on the subject, while the Obama administration pledged to carry out a major study in an effort to establish how many women are living with the consequences of it in the United States and how many girls are at risk. In the UK, it was announced that a \u00a31.4m FGM prevention programme would be set up, parents will be prosecuted if they fail to prevent their daughter being cut, and victims of FGM would get lifelong anonymity. More than 600 people attended an event at the Walworth academy at the Girl Summit in which the education campaigner Malala Yousafzai, who was shot in the face by the Taliban while trying to get an education in Pakistan as a 15-year-old, called on those countries where FGM takes place, to change. &quot;We should not be followers of those traditions that go against human rights,&quot; she told the summit.

The Palestinian Authority in the West Bank called for a \u201cday of rage\u201d after more than 15 women, children and UN staff were killed in Gaza and around 200 injured when a UN shelter for those fleeing the Israeli bombing was hit. The Israel Defence Forces insisted it had given the occupants of the shelter time to leave before shelling the area. But the UN flatly contradicted this. More than 800 Palestinians \u2013 mostly civilians \u2013 have been killed. Over 140,000 Palestinians have sought shelter in UN premises during the conflict. Several schools run by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, have come under fire in the last week.

The Conservative government sold off state-owned enterprises throughout the 1980s and the 1990s \u2013 electricity, oil, gas, rail, airline, airports, telecommunications, water, steel, coal, you name it. In the worldwide fever for selling off state assets that gripped those decades, the rest of the world looked up to Britain as the guiding example. Privatisation was halted under Labour. However, the belief in the superiority of the private sector was such that, when it brought the rail infrastructure back under state control in 2002 following a series of rail disasters, Labour made sure it did not take the form of re-nationalisation \u2013 at least in legal terms. Network Rail, the owner and operator of the rail infrastructure, was set up as a private company, although on a not-for-profit basis and without shareholders. When the coalition came to power in 2010, it resumed the privatisation drive with gusto. It privatised Royal Mail \u2013 the \u201ccrown jewels\u201d that even Thatcher balked at selling. However, in recent months the tide has started to turn, albeit slowly. Even while planning to sell off almost every remaining state-owned enterprise, from plasma supply to helicopter search and rescue, the coalition has had to make an embarrassing climbdown over its plan to privatise student loans. More importantly, in the past few months the Royal Mail sell-off has been fiercely criticised. Moya Greene, its chief executive, has questioned the viability of its universal service obligation. Abandoning this would mean that customers who live in less accessible or sparsely populated \u2013 and thus less profitable \u2013 areas wouldn\u2019t get their letters delivered, or would have to pay more for them: the end of the postal service as we know it. In the meantime, the Labour party has made the lack of competition and the suspected collusion in the privatised energy industry a key issue in its promise to \u201cfix broken markets\u201d, and has caught voters\u2019 attention by announcing its intention to partially reverse rail privatisation. Although its fear of being branded anti-business has prevented it from proposing outright renationalisation of the railways \u2013 despite the support for such a move from most of the electorate \u2013 it has declared that if it wins the 2015 general election it will \u201creverse the presumption against the public sector\u201d, and let state operators bid for rail franchises. However, if it is really to overturn the privatisation dogma, Labour should do more than reverse the presumption against the public sector: it should tell people that the public sector is often more efficient than the private sector. Even while there are many examples of inefficient state enterprises from all over the world, including the UK, there have been many successful such businesses throughout the history of capitalism. In the early days of their industrialisation, 19th-century Germany and Japan set up state-run \u201cmodel factories\u201d in order to kickstart new industries such as steel and shipbuilding, which the private sector considered too risky to invest in. For half a century after the second world war, several European countries used state businesses to develop technologically advanced industries: France is the best-known example, with household names like Thomson (now Thales), Alcatel, Renault and Saint-Gobain. Austria, Finland and Norway also had technologically dynamic state-run enterprises. The most dramatic example, however, is Singapore. The country is usually known for its free trade policy and welcoming attitude towards foreign investments, but it has the most heavily state-owned economy, except for some oil states. State-owned enterprises produce 22% of Singapore\u2019s national output, operating in a whole range of industries \u2013 not just the \u201cusual suspects\u201d of airline, telecommunications and electricity, but also semiconductors, engineering and shipping; and its housing and development board supplies 85% of the country\u2019s homes. Taiwan, another east Asian \u201cmiracle\u201d economy, also has a very large state-run sector, accounting for 16% of national output. Posco, the state-owned steel company in my native South Korea, was initially set up against World Bank advice but is now one of the biggest steel companies in the world. (It was privatised in 2001, but for political reasons rather than poor performance.) In Brazil, Embraer \u2013 the third largest civilian aircraft manufacturer in the world \u2013 was initially developed under state control; and the country\u2019s state-owned oil company, Petrobras, is the world leader in deep-sea drilling. Arguably the most successful state enterprise in human history, however, is the United States military, which has almost single-handedly established the modern information economy. The development of the computer was initially funded by the US army; the country\u2019s navy financed the research that created the semiconductor; and the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency developed the Arpanet, the precursor of the internet. When people realise that the history of capitalism is full of highly successful state enterprises, the rush for ever more privatisation can be halted. If the Labour party puts forward this case, it will not only gain popularity in the run-up to next year\u2019s general election \u2013 it would also be doing something of lasting benefit for Britain."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/morning-mail-gaza-on-a-precipice-children-in-detention-investigators-reach-mh17-ebola-outbreak", "publicationDate": "2014-07-31T21:48:05Z", "tags": ["Australia news", "Gaza"], "sentences": ["\u2022 The Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung has been hit by a massive gas explosion."], "title": "Morning Mail: Gaza on a precipice; children in detention; investigators reach MH17; Ebola outbreak", "article": "Good morning folks, and welcome to the Morning Mail \u2013 sign up here to get it straight to your inbox before 8am every weekday.

No vaccine or drug treatment exists for the disease, and there are ethical questions over whether trials of treatments should be conducted during epidemics such as the current one. The US Peace Corps has evacuated hundreds of volunteers from three west African countries, and two are under isolation after possible contact.

The series of explosions about midnight Thursday and early Friday struck a district where several petrochemical plans operate pipelines alongside the sewer system of Kaohsiung, a south-western port with 2.8 million people. The fires were believed to have been caused by a leak of propene, a petrochemical material not intended for public use, but the source of the gas was not immediately clear, officials said. Video from the TVBS broadcaster showed residents searching for victims in shattered storefronts and rescuers pulling injured people from the rubble of a road and placing them on stretchers while passersby helped other victims on a sidewalk. Broadcaster ETTV showed rows of large fires sending smoke into the night sky. Four firefighters were among the 24 dead and 271 people were injured, the National Fire Agency said. The firefighters had been at the scene investigating reports of a gas leak when the explosions occurred, Taiwan&apos;s Central News Agency reported. At least five blasts shook the city, said Taiwan&apos;s Premier Jiang Yi-huah. Chang Jia-juch, the director of the Central Disaster Emergency Operation Center, said the leaking gas was most likely to be propene, meaning that the resulting fires could not be extinguished by water. He said emergency workers would have to wait until the gas was burnt away. The source of the leak was unknown. Chang said, however, that propene was not for public use and that it was a petrochemical material. The Kaohsiung mayor, Chen Chu, said several petrochemical companies had pipelines built along the sewage system in Chian-Chen district, which has both factories and residential buildings. &quot;Our priority is to save people now. We ask citizens living along the pipelines to evacuate,&quot; Chen told TVBS television. Power was cut off in the area, making it difficult for firefighters to search for others who might be buried in rubble. Channel NewsAsia said the local fire department received reports from residents of gas leakage at about 8.46pm and explosions started around midnight. Closed-circuit television showed an explosion rippling through the floor of a motorcycle parking area, hurling concrete and other debris through the air. Mobile phone video captured the sound of an explosion as flames leapt at least nine metres (30ft) into the air. One of the explosions left a large trench running down the center of a road, edged with piles of concrete slabs torn apart by the force of the blast. A damaged motorcycle lay in the crater and TVBS showed cars flipped over.

This is the ninth world sudoku championships, this year being held in the UK for the first time. Teams of four from 34 different countries, from China to South Korea, Greece to the USA, have travelled thousands of miles to a suburban hotel in Surrey to compete for the glory of the title of world sudoku champion. Held over two days, the competitors will take part in 11 45-minute rounds, grappling with over 60 different varieties that \u2013 with names such as killer udoku, thermo sudoku, and even sandwich sudoku \u2013 are a far cry from your garden-variety newspaper puzzle. Eight of the rounds are done individually, while in three others competitors work to solve the puzzles in their national teams. The top ten individuals then enter the heated play-offs, where the winner will be decided on Tuesday evening. With no prize money, no controversies and no recorded incidences of cheating, this may be the most civilised competition in the world. Yet it becomes clear that, in countries such as South Korea, sudoku and puzzles are an increasingly serious business. The youngest in their junior team is ten, and attended a two-day sudoku training camp before flying over to the UK.     Held over two days, the competitors will take part in 11 45-minute rounds, grappling with over 60 different varieties of sudoku. Photograph: Teri Pengilley for the Guardian    &quot;Some things are difficult and some things are easy,&quot; said 12-year-old Kim Yu-jae, giggling next to her teammate Yoo Jin-kyo, also 12. &quot;I love sudoku, I have been doing it for two years. In Korea we go to a training camp for two days where we just do lots and lots of sudoku puzzles. We went to the same academy and that was where we were both introduced to sudoku.&quot; The pair collapse into laughter as Yoo adds: &quot;It&apos;s a little bit scary and this round was very difficult.&quot; The gender ratio of this year&apos;s competition is heavily skewed towards men, with women making up only about 30% of this year&apos;s competitors and only one female world champion on record. Competitors this year range from seven to 65 and upwards. In team USA, maths teacher Joshua Zucker, 38, is competing alongside his seven-year-old daughter Celeste. &quot;The puzzles have been really good this year, some fun ones,&quot; said Zucker. &quot;Plain old sudoku gets boring after your first thousand or so but with all these different variations it stays really fun. Some of the authors make really elegant, beautiful puzzles and there&apos;s something really artistic about the logic of them. &quot;I&apos;m a freelance maths teacher. I like sudoku because it&apos;s something that completely absorbs my focus and every other thing I might be thinking just goes away and I totally live in that world of simple and beautiful logic.&quot;. His daughter, he said, had yet to beat him at sudoku, though the pair of them practiced for the competition by sitting on the sofa and doing the puzzles together. &quot;Her goal here is just to get a score better than zero,&quot; he added.

It&apos;s not just bad luck, it&apos;s a big disaster and it&apos;s gone all wrong.&quot; They were not alone. Lu Pei, a 38-year-old primary school teacher competing for Taiwan for the first time this year, was also lamenting his own puzzle failures. &quot;I enjoyed it very much but now I&apos;m a little sad because my scores were very low,&quot; he said. &quot;I looked around and I couldn&apos;t believe people solve them so quickly \u2013 people around me solved them all when I had only done one or two.&quot; Shaking his head with a sigh, he added: &quot;Maybe I need to practice my skills.&quot; Alan O&apos;Donnell, chair of the UK Puzzle Association and organiser of this year&apos;s championships, emphasised that the event was run purely by volunteers who simply loved puzzles. &quot;It&apos;s been particularly difficult to arrange this year because we are not a corporate enterprise, we are just a bunch of amateurs,&quot; said O&apos;Donnell, himself a former competitor. &quot;But we&apos;ve got record numbers coming this year; China broke the records last year but we&apos;ve smashed that. This is the most-all encompassing sport in the world \u2013 we&apos;ve got a mix of people of all ages, genders and nationalities competing at an international standard. &quot;People come here, not for cash prizes, but because they love the challenge of completing the puzzles and being part of the international puzzling community,&quot; O&apos;Donnell added. &quot;Only a quarter of the people taking part here have a realistic chance of winning, the rest come simply for the atmosphere and the challenge. It is clean and honest and fair. We are just trying to spread the joy really and share our love of puzzling.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/13/robin-williams-media-report-suicide", "publicationDate": "2014-08-13T12:11:00Z", "tags": ["Depression", "Suicide rates", "Society", "Film", "Robin Williams", "Mental health", "Health", "Newspapers", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media"], "sentences": ["To see what could happen here if the media don&apos;t start reporting Robin Williams&apos;s death more responsibly, you only have to look at what happened in Taiwan after the suicide of a high-profile celebrity, where there was a great deal of media coverage of the method used."], "title": "Robin Williams death: media has duty to report suicide responsibly", "article": "Around 6,000 people in the UK kill themselves while depressed every year \u2013 a large majority of them (77%) men. They all have different reasons for wanting to end their lives, and usually it is not a single reason \u2013 not just the loss of a job, a marital breakdown or a sense of worthlessness but a complex intermingling of negative thoughts and issues. People who are depressed do not necessarily have the drive, the certainty or the know-how to kill themselves. Wall-to-wall coverage on newspaper front pages, on the TV and on the internet of the suicide of a celebrity can change that. The Samaritans produced a set of guidelines for the media reporting suicides some years ago, in conjunction with journalists, in the understanding that there is a genuine public interest in exploring why people kill themselves. Nobody has ever suggested a news blackout. But the Samaritans and other mental health groups such as Mind say that, above all else, reporting details of the manner in which somebody killed themselves may give the depressed individual information they lacked or an idea they had not thought of and spur them to try it. But in the rush to understand and report the death of Robin Williams, even that basic rule has been flouted. &quot;It&apos;s noticeable that some newspapers are ignoring the Samaritans&apos; media reporting guidelines. Some articles are dwelling on the method,&quot; says writer and broadcaster Claudia Hammond, presenter of BBC Radio 4&apos;s All in the Mind. &quot;This could be all it takes to encourage someone who was contemplating suicide to actually do it. There&apos;s lots of research showing that some people will kill themselves if there&apos;s a method available to them, but that if that method is taken away, by having high railings on a bridge, for example, then many will not go somewhere else to do it. They won&apos;t try. &quot;If someone is already feeling desperate, then reading about details of how to do it can be enough. Many years ago an episode of Casualty showed someone taking an overdose of a particular drug. The following week there was a 17% increase in this kind of suicide attempt. To see what could happen here if the media don&apos;t start reporting Robin Williams&apos;s death more responsibly, you only have to look at what happened in Taiwan after the suicide of a high-profile celebrity, where there was a great deal of media coverage of the method used. For four weeks suicide rates rose.&quot; The guidelines also warn that the tone and extent of coverage can influence somebody thinking of ending their life. If suicide sounds in some way as if it solves a problem or is associated with a brilliant and creative individual, with suggestions that maybe without their depression they would not have been a comic genius, that casts it in a more attractive, more acceptable light. The Samaritans urges us to avoid some terms, such as the old-fashioned &quot;commit suicide&quot;, as if it were a deliberate, thought-out act, or &quot;successful suicide&quot;, as if this were a positive event, and instead use the balder &quot;death by suicide&quot; or &quot;take one&apos;s own life&quot;. In Bridgend in south Wales, news reports suggesting links between a number of suicides may have provoked more. In February 2008, the parents of a 15-year-old boy who killed himself accused the media of glamorising suicide. Sharon Pritchard, mother of Nathaniel, said: &quot;We have lost our son and the media reporting of this has made it more unbearable. We feel the media coverage could trigger other people who are already feeling low to take their own lives. We feel that Nathaniel might have thought it was a way of getting attention without fully thinking through the consequences.&quot; Assistant chief constable David Morris said the link between the deaths of four more young people since that of Natasha Randall, 17, which first attracted media attention to the area, was: &quot;You, the media.&quot; Mind twice issued briefings to newsdesks on Tuesday, urging care over the reporting of Robin Williams&apos;s death. &quot;We are disappointed to see some quite graphic language about the method of suicide. There is clear evidence that graphic reporting can lead to copycat behaviour,&quot; said Alison Kerry of the mental health charity. Suicide is always tragic. For coverage of one suicide to lead to others is doubly so. Depression is a disease which can be fatal, but does not have to be. With psychological help, and awareness and understanding from the people around them, people can get over the bad times. Mental health issues are under-reported, support organisations say, and so a real opportunity arises in the wake of a tragedy such as the death of a well-loved celebrity to explain mental illness and encourage people to help those who are struggling \u2013 and not compound it by inadvertently giving a green light to those who are contemplating ending their own lives. \u2022 In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255.

Supporting this view was the news that the number of those taking general studies, a subject derided by many as an easy option, dropped by 24%, with PE also seeing a large decline.

Photograph: /AP    Yes, women can do maths, and the Iranian mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani made history this week when she became the first female winner of the Fields Medal, often described as the Nobel prize for mathematics. The 37-year-old Stanford University professor, born and raised in Tehran, describes the language of maths as full of \u201cbeauty and elegance\u201d and says she became fascinated with the subject when her brother used to come home and talk about what he had learned at school.  By the time she was a teenager, Mirzakhani was taking part in international maths olympiads, winning gold medals in 1994 and 1995. She completed a PhD at Harvard in 2004 and works on problems related to geometric structures on surfaces and their deformations.  What is inspiring is that she didn\u2019t always want to do maths; she dreamed of becoming a writer when she was a child.

Egypt massacre last year was premeditated, rights group says      Egypt\u2019s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. Photograph: /Barcroft Media    In what became one of the bloodiest days in modern history, Egyptian security forces intentionally killed at least 817 protesters in Rabaa a year ago, according to a Human Rights Watch report. The killings were reminiscent of the 1989 Tiananmen Square killings in China: they were systematic, widespread and \u201cprobably amount to crimes against humanity\u201d.  It recommended that several senior individuals, including President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, are investigated and held to account for their role in planning the massacre, which occurred in August 2013 during the dispersal of a six-week-old encampment in Cairo\u2019s Al-Adawiya Square, set up by demonstrators protesting the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi. The report states that the camp\u2019s estimated 85,000 protesters were not given enough time to leave before troops started firing and were prevented for from leaving via safe exits.  Speaking to the Guardian, 61-year-old former oil worker Hussein Abdel Aal said he had witnessed his son Ramzy being shot dead by a sniper. He said Ramzy was standing far from the edge of the camp and \u201cdid not have any kind of weapons.

Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images    After a five-week-long war in Gaza, mediators in Cairo brokered a five-day extension to the current ceasefire shortly before a midnight deadline on Wednesday.  Efforts to extend the truce went to the wire and Hamas, the Islamist organisation in power in Gaza, said it believed there was a \u201creal opportunity\u201d to reach an agreement with Israel to end the conflict in Gaza.  Hamas negotiator Khalil al-Hayya told reporters: \u201cThere is still a real chance to clinch an agreement, but Israel must stop playing with words.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are not interested in more destruction for our people. We are not interested in more bloodshed.\u201d  Egyptian mediators appeared to be striving for a two-part agreement: 1) Easing Israeli restrictions on imports and exports, increasing the number of permits issued to Gazans to enter or travel through Israel, reducing the size of the no-go \u201cbuffer zone\u201d inside Gaza\u2019s perimeter, and expanding the permitted fishing zone. 2) To follow some weeks later, a focus on Hamas\u2019s demands for a sea and airport, and the possible release of some Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the remains of two Israeli soldiers killed in the conflict which Hamas is believed to be holding as a bargaining tool. Hamas also wants the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt to be opened, possibly policed by Palestinian Authority security forces. Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade since 2006 that has sent unemployment and poverty soaring. Russian military vehicles enter Ukraine as aid convoy stops short     The Russian aid convoy parked in a field about 30km from the Russian-Ukrainian border. Photograph: Yuri Kochetkov/EPA    While a convoy of Russian trucks carrying humanitarian aid arrived close to the border of Ukraine on Thursday, the Guardian saw a column of 23 armoured personnel carriers, supported by fuel trucks and other logistics vehicles with official Russian military plates, travelling towards the border near the Russian town of Donetsk, Ukraine. The Guardian\u2019s Shaun Walker reports:  After pausing by the side of the road until nightfall, the convoy crossed into Ukrainian territory, using a rough dirt track and clearly crossing through a gap in a barbed wire fence that demarcates the border. Armed men were visible in the gloom by the border fence as the column moved into Ukraine. Kiev has lost control of its side of the border in this area. The trucks are unlikely to represent a full-scale official Russian invasion, and it was unclear how far they planned to travel inside Ukrainian territory and how long they would stay. But it was incontrovertible evidence of what Ukraine has long claimed \u2013 that Russian troops are active inside its borders.\u201d  Walker also tweeted a photo:    Erm ok so this isn&#39;t humanitarian aid.

However in Kiev\u2019s view, the convoy is at best a cynical ploy and at worst, a kind of Trojan centipede. The armoured vehicles seen by the Guardian are further evidence of Russia\u2019s incursions, which the Kremlin has repeatedly denied. Sharks take a bite out of Google     Sharks have been attacking undersea cables, causing internet disruption. Photograph: Kevin Weng/Reuters     In a case of nature v technology, sharks have been biting the world\u2019s undersea data cables.

It is thought that sharks may be attracted to the magnetic field, something suggested by the lack of attacks on older, slower, copper cables.  Calm descends over Ferguson after four nights of violence      A child holds a sign during a vigil at Hart Plaza in downtown Detroit for Michael Brown, who was shot dead by a police officer in Ferguson. Photograph: Zuma/Rex    Thursday evening saw reduced clashes in the small suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, over the death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown and subsequent claims of police brutality toward African-Americans.  The initial operation \u2013 this included highly militarised police officers reportedly throwing tear gas and firing rubber bullets at the largely unarmed protesters, the shutting down of roads leading into the city and the implementation of a no-fly Zone \u2013 was replaced on the demand of the state governor, Jay Nixon, who had been urged by Barack Obama to restore peace. Veteran civil rights activist John Lewis had also suggested that troops under federal control should replace local police, although Obama did not go so far as to condemn the latter. The change of tactics saw a reduction in the police presence and the appointment of a new police chief on the ground, Ron Johnson. Rena Perry, 33, who had been among the crowds, said: \u201cIt\u2019s just so different. The other nights the police were over there and we was over here. It was a war. This new guy has changed the atmosphere.\u201d  People gathered at a large intersection in a carnival-like demonstration. However, Johnson refused to rule out the use of military-style equipment that had initially attracted such controversy.

Their businesses also take on pressing real-world problems \u2013 ranging from an overabundance of solid waste to an under-supply of living-wage jobs.  Every year, dozens of social venture startups enter annual competitions sponsored by universities, government agencies and other organizations. Winning these contests often means a fat cash prize and technical assistance, as well as welcome attention from potential new investors and customers.  The competitions provide a snapshot of the diverse ways creative young business people around the world are striving to do good by doing business. Often these entrepreneurs have developed a deep understanding of a specific local problem in order to come up with a solution that will succeed on the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit.  We\u2019ve looked through the latest crop of sustainable business plan competition entrants to highlight a few of the recent standouts: Environment: Sampurn(e)arth In this year\u2019s Global Social Venture Competition at the University of California at Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, Mumbai-based Sampurn(e)arth Environmental Solutions earned the $25,000 grand prize for a nuanced business approach that encompasses customer service, cleaner energy generation, recycling and social justice.  The startup sells bio-digesters and composters to corporate offices, hotels and university campuses, and then operates them for the customer. Organic waste is processed to produce methane for energy generation, while other trash is sorted and sent for recycling. Both services reduce the expense of trucking waste to landfills. To staff its sites, Sampurn(e)arth partners with an NGO that aids women waste pickers, who typically scavenge re-sellable materials out of Mumbai\u2019s massive, centralized dumps. After training, these workers manage operations including sorting organic from non-compostable waste and operating the composters and digesters. The jobs offer a regular living wage, safe working conditions and skills the women can take to future employment. All that helped give it a leg up over formidable finalists at the competition, which included Basikeli Ugunduzi\u2019s new model for providing affordable bicycle repair services in Africa; Indonesian startup Chique\u2019s cheap flooring tiles made from chicken feathers; Khusela of South Africa\u2019s inexpensive fire detection and alarm system for shack towns and other informal urban settlements; and Taiwan-based Redeem\u2019s job-training and employer-employee matching services for ex-offenders. Waste: REEcycle Another winning startup, REEcycle, has its eye on a different solid waste stream. Founded by a team of students from the University of Houston, the company acquires used electronics from e-waste recyclers. It uses a solvent-based system, which it claims is less expensive and hazardous than other currently-used methods, to recover valuable rare earth elements from the components and sell them for re-use. REEcycle was one of six regional winners of a $100,000 prize in the National Clean Energy Business Plan Competition sponsored by the US Department of Energy in May, as well as the agency\u2019s juried national competition in June. The DOE lauded REEcycle as \u201cthe first company to profitably reclaim neodymium and dysprosium, two critical rare earth elements necessary for a low carbon economy.\u201d Energy:KAir Battery Because renewable energy sources like the sun are intermittent, low-cost energy storage is considered crucial to the industry\u2019s growth. Ohio-based KAir Battery, another regional winner of the DOE\u2019s clean energy competition, is developing a potassium-air battery that it describes as using safe materials, efficient, and able to store more energy per volume than existing battery technologies.  Safety: Mobile Monitoring Station Among the health-related social ventures in recent competitions, Chile-based Mobile Monitoring Station won the 2013 Intel Global Challenge for its system of wearable sensors for the mining industry. Attached to the jackets of mine workers, the gear monitors worker health and mine safety and pushes the data to a smart phone.  Health: Disease Diagnostic Group Malaria sickens millions and kills hundreds of thousands of people every year, but most forms respond to treatment when diagnosed in time. Disease Diagnostic Group, founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate student John R Lewandowski, is developing a lightweight portable device that health workers can carry into remote communities to do quick, accurate testing for malaria. The machine magnetizes a blood sample in water and sends a laser through it to detect malaria parasites in less than a minute. The company has won numerous business plan competitions, including the 2014 MIT $100K Accelerate Contest. Economic development: First Access Mobile phones remain a popular economic development tool for social ventures. First Access, winner of the William James Foundation\u2019s Sustainable Business Plan Competition last year, is offering a cloud-based software system accessible via mobile to facilitate microlending.  Lenders can use the service to evaluate the credit risk of applicants more quickly than the traditional bank process. The process increases profit margins for lenders, according to First Access, while also helping millions of people who have no banking history gain access to business loans. First Access is partnering with telecom operators this year to test the service in Tanzania, and intends to offer the easily-scaled service in the rest of Africa as well as Asia and Latin America.

The state news agency Xinhua said at the weekend that a court in Yantai, Shandong province, will try five people for murder on Thursday, three of whom &quot;used a cult organisation to undermine enforcement of the law&quot;. In late May, the five defendants \u2013 Zhang Fan, Zhang Lidong, L\u00fc Yingchun, Zhang Hang, and Zhang Qiao \u2013 and a 12-year-old child walked through a McDonald&apos;s in Zhaoyuan, also in Shandong, soliciting phone numbers from diners. One woman, Wu Shuoyan, 37, was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son; when she refused to give her number, the group beat her to death with chairs and a metal mop handle. The act was captured by CCTV cameras and witnesses using smartphones. The footage quickly went viral online, with many web users wondering why bystanders did not intervene. State media quickly turned the conversation to religion: the attackers belonged to the quasi-Christian group Church of Almighty God, also known as Eastern Lightning, Xinhua said. One of the attackers, Zhang Lidong, later appeared in a prison interview, which was broadcast on national television. The unemployed pharmaceutical salesman said the group \u2013 which he has been a member of for seven years \u2013 attacked Wu &quot;because she is a monster. She is an evil spirit. We are not afraid of the law. We have faith in God.&quot; The Church of Almighty God was founded in 1989 by Zhao Weishan, a physics teacher who grew up in Henan province, central China, but fled to the US more than a decade ago. Adherents believe Jesus has returned to earth as a Chinese woman named Lightning Deng, and hold that belonging to the group will save them from an impending apocalypse. Members believe they&apos;re entrenched in a life-or-death struggle against the &quot;Great Red Dragon&quot; \u2013 a clear reference to the ruling Communist party. Chinese authorities have listed the Church of Almighty God as one of 14 banned &quot;evil cults&quot;, along with the persecuted spiritual group Falun Gong, and have made repeated attempts to eradicate it \u2013 Xinhua said in June that more than 1,500 group members have been detained.

Its website claims that it has millions of members. A Taiwanese phone contact on its website led to a woman who said the group has no spokesperson. She then sent a link to a statement about the McDonald&apos;s murder, which the group posted online. &quot;This case itself is full of lies and layered with dubious facts \u2013 the lies used to frame and entrap the Church of Almighty God are collapsing in on themselves,&quot; it said. &quot;What&apos;s really astonishing is that the rulers of such a magnificent country would use such vile and reprehensible methods to shift the blame [for the attack] on to the Church of Almighty God.&quot; State media honed in on the group in December 2012 after it organised small-scale demonstrations to coincide with the rumoured Mayan apocalypse. Authorities arrested more than 500 adherents across nine provinces. &quot;The government designating something as an &apos;evil cult&apos; is a problematic concept from a human rights point of view,&quot; said Maya Wang, a Hong Kong-based researcher for Human Rights Watch. &quot;The McDonald&apos;s killing was terrible, and I think the people should be held accountable. But then the government has subsequently gone after members of Eastern Lightning for organising activities that weren&apos;t against the law.&quot; Other Christian organisations have derided the Church of Almighty God&apos;s doctrine as heresy. &quot;One person from my church was converted to the Church of Almighty God \u2013 I tried to get the person back and didn&apos;t succeed,&quot; the leader of one underground Protestant church told the Guardian in 2012. Many adherents live in rural areas and lack formal education, he said. The group &quot;parses the meaning of each [biblical] verse, and makes sure their messages are highly relevant to Chinese culture.

His diary dissecting Maoism and the cultural revolution, Les Habits Neufs du Pr\u00e9sident Mao (The Chairman&apos;s New Clothes, 1971), echoed the title of the Hans Christian Andersen fable and made its thesis plain in its first few words. The cultural revolution, he said, had nothing revolutionary about it except the name and nothing cultural about it except the initial tactical pretext: &quot;It was a power struggle waged at the top between a handful of men and behind the smokescreen of a fictitious mass movement.&quot; This pioneering attack on the cultural revolution and its associated mythology did not initially create a great stir, even in France, where the cult of Mao had reached rare heights. Le Monde gave it a brief and condescending mention, saying that, while some facts were accurately reported, there were mistakes and information that could not be checked. Sources, it said, were not usually quoted and the author clearly had no experience of that of which he spoke. Others were less charitable, accusing Ryckmans of being a CIA agent, and the book became steadily more controversial, the more so when a later volume, Ombres Chinoises (1974, translated as Chinese Shadows, 1976), appeared, in which Ryckmans made plain his contempt for the gullible but ignorant self-appointed sinophiles who were treated to visits to China during which they were shown nothing of the real life of the masses with whom they felt such empathy. Born in Brussels, he studied law and art history at the Catholic University of Louvain. His contact with China began when he was 19, one of a delegation of young Belgians invited to the country on a trip that included a meeting with Zhou Enlai, the premier under Mao. As he put it: &quot;My overwhelming impression (a conclusion to which I remained faithful for the rest of my life) was that it would be inconceivable to live in this world, in our age, without a good knowledge of Chinese language and a direct access to Chinese culture.&quot; To that end, he spent 12 years in the far east, in particular Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong, where he became an acknowledged expert on Chinese painting, calligraphy and poetry. In Hong Kong he monitored the Chinese press on behalf of Belgian diplomats. He was invited to teach at the Australian National University in Canberra in 1970, and adopted his pen name for his first book so that he would be able to re-enter China. In 1972, he was given a six-month attachment to the Belgian embassy in Beijing, an experience that provided the material for Chinese Shadows. But then a fellow sinologist identified Simon Leys as Ryckmans, thereby ruling out any further return to the country whose culture and people he venerated. He later taught at the University of Sydney, and continued to write. Fluent in French, English and Chinese, he had a wide intellectual hinterland, including authors as varied as George Orwell, GK Chesterton and the 20th-century Chinese writer Lu Xun. He was fascinated by the sea and wrote a well-received account of a 17th-century nautical disaster, The Wreck of the Batavia (2005). His novella The Death of Napoleon (1991) was filmed as The Emperor&apos;s New Clothes, with Ian Holm in the title role. The play on the Andersen title this time referred to an imposter remaining imprisoned on St Helena while Napoleon returned to Paris, but Ryckmans was disappointed by the production. He was not afraid of controversy and had a well-publicised row with the late Christopher Hitchens in the New York Review of Books over comments Hitchens made about Mother Teresa. Ryckmans lived in Australia for more than four decades, but retained his Belgian nationality.

If it encountered an unmapped traffic light, and there were no cars or pedestrians around, the car could run a red light simply because it wouldn&apos;t know the light is there. Alberto Broggi, a professor studying autonomous driving at Italy&apos;s Universit\u00e0 di Parma, says he worries about how a map-dependent system like Google&apos;s will respond if a route has seen changes like the addition of a new stop sign at an intersection. [Google car team director Chris] Urmson says the company had a strategy to handle the updating issue, but he declines to describe it in any detail. Some experts are bothered by Google&apos;s refusal to provide that sort of safety-related information. Michael Wagner, a Carnegie Mellon robotics researcher studying the transition to autonomous driving, says the public &quot;has a right to be concerned&quot; about Google&apos;s reticence: &quot;This is a very early-stage technology, which makes asking these kinds of questions all the more justified.&quot; Certain aspects of the car&apos;s design do not seem to be widely appreciated. For example, Bernard Soriano, the California DMV official responsible for autonomous vehicles in the state, was unaware that the car couldn&apos;t handle unmapped intersection stop signs, despite numerous briefings from Google. When told about the limitation by MIT Technology Review, he said he would be seeking a &quot;clarification&quot; about the issue from Google.  &quot;Unmapped stop signs&quot; could also include stop/go signs or temporary traffic lights (around roadworks). Motherboard price competition expands to Europe &gt;&gt; Digitimes  The fierce price competition between Asustek Computer and Gigabyte Technology has recently expanded to Europe as demand in China is falling short of expectations and is putting strong pressure on ASRock and Micro-Star International (MSI), which have a large proportion of their shipments coming from Europe, according to sources from motherboard players. With overall motherboard demand dropping and Asustek and Gigabyte still expected to ship over 20m units in 2014, small players, which are not able to survive the price war, are expected to be eliminated from the market.  Any time IDC or Gartner says PC sales are falling, there are some who say that all that&apos;s happening is that &quot;finished PC&quot; sales are being replaced by &quot;build your own&quot; PC parts sales. This puts some context to them (total finished PC sales are expected to be about 303.5m in 2014). Of course, a proportion (unknown) of motherboards will go for replacement/repair of existing PCs. Notable too that Digitimes says that &quot;overall motherboard demand&quot; is dropping - which suggests that &quot;build your own&quot; isn&apos;t expanding.  In fact, according to a Taiwanese research company, &quot;the worldwide motherboard shipment volume in 2013 reached approximately 143.2m units, down 2.8% year on year.&quot;  The End of Gamers &gt;&gt; Dan Golding  When, over the last decade, the playing of videogames moved beyond the niche, the gamer identity remained fairly uniformly stagnant and immobile. Gamer identity was simply not fluid enough to apply to a broad spectrum of people. It could not meaningfully contain, for example, Candy Crush players, Proteus players, and Call of Duty players simultaneously. When videogames changed, the gamer identity did not stretch, and so it has been broken. And lest you think that I&apos;m exaggerating about the irrelevance of the traditionally male dominated gamer identity, recent news confirms this, with adult women outnumbering teenage boys in game-playing demographics in the USA. Similar numbers also often come out of Australian surveys. The predictable &apos;what kind of games do they really play, though\u2014are they really gamers?&apos; response says all you need to know about this ongoing demographic shift.  Golding&apos;s starting point is the ongoing misogyny around women who play, write or analyse games. See also Andrew Todd&apos;s article below. Something is going very wrong. (Via Mary Hamilton.) Sliding rocks on Racetrack Playa, Death Valley National Park: first observation of rocks in motion &gt;&gt; PLOS One  In contrast with previous hypotheses of powerful winds or thick ice floating rocks off the playa surface, the process of rock movement that we have observed occurs when the thin, 3 to 6 mm, &quot;windowpane&quot; ice sheet covering the playa pool begins to melt in late morning sun and breaks up under light winds of ~4\u20135 m/s. Floating ice panels 10 s of meters in size push multiple rocks at low speeds of 2\u20135 m/min. along trajectories determined by the direction and velocity of the wind as well as that of the water flowing under the ice.  Included simply because it&apos;s such a fascinating phenomenon. Video games, misogyny, and terrorism: a guide to assholes &gt;&gt; Badass Digest Andrew Todd on video gaming&apos;s problem with women:   I have a friend who plays a lot of Call of Duty. He&apos;s a brilliant comedian whose name you&apos;ll probably know in the future, though I won&apos;t mention it here. One of his favourite aspects of the game is verbally abusing other players - he LOVES it. It&apos;s another game within a game. But it doesn&apos;t matter if you&apos;re the funniest or cleverest abusive dick on a server - you&apos;re still being an abusive dick, and you&apos;re still perpetuating a problem that has visibly grown way past that comparatively innocent context and into actual terrorism. There&apos;s no reputable research that states violent video games create violent video gamers, but I&apos;d be curious to see whether they create abusive ones. At this point, abuse and harassment are as ingrained into gamer culture as headshots and killstreaks - but the difference between the two is that while the violence is fake, the abuse is real.  This is an intriguing suggestion that seems worth pursuing. The focus though of Todd&apos;s piece is rampant misogyny:   The ultimate, hilarious irony to these douchebags&apos; worldview is that they claim to want gaming to be taken seriously. In their blinkered eyes, women are ruining gaming, because in their blinkered eyes, change that benefits anyone other than them is inherently bad. But feminist criticism can only be a boon to the games industry.  Wearable device now, iWatch later &gt;&gt; AAPL Orchard  Apple may view the wearables category as requiring training wheels as consumers may not understand or connect with a full blown &quot;iWatch&quot; right out of the gate, so an in-between wearable device would be required to make the learning curve more manageable. \u00a0For example, an iPad introduced in 2005 probably would not have done as well since people wouldn&apos;t have been familiar with a touch interface - not to mention the lack of an app ecosystem. \u00a0It is possible Apple will initially sell a wearable device similar to a fitness band, but focused on the much broader and mainstream subject of health, only to expand the lineup in subsequent years with various editions, price points, and styles. \u00a0I have a growing suspicion that Apple&apos;s wearables category will not be comprised of just one or two models but an array of devices as wearables will usher the era of fashion into personal technology. Apple&apos;s recent retail hires support my thesis that a new way of thinking is required to sell a range (maybe up to dozens?) of wrist devices.  Contrast with Google&apos;s full-on approach - Google Glass hyped ahead of any release to the public (even beta testers) and again with Android Wear, shown through &quot;concept videos&quot; ahead of the availability of any product. iPhone 1 vs Intex Cloud FX: is the \u00a320 smartphone modelled on the original iPhone? &gt;&gt; Phone Cruncher Mat Toor:   The Intex Cloud FX aims to bring base level smartphone functionality to the millions of Indian mobile phone users stuck on feature phones. But what was interesting when looking at the detailed technical specifications of the Intex Cloud FX was how similar they were to those of the original Apple iPhone launched back in 2007. For instance, both phones boast of 128MB of onboard RAM and sport 3.5-inch capacitive touch screens. The resolution of the two displays is identical at 320 by 480px and the actual dimensions of the phone cases match almost to the millimetre.  Acute observation. The Intex Cloud FX is Mozilla&apos;s Firefox OS phone. First 64-bit Android phone has no 64-bit software &gt;&gt; Ars Technica Ron Amadeo:   While the chip is 64-bit, the HTC Desire 510 doesn&apos;t actually run any 64-bit software \u2014 it runs Android 4.4, a 32-bit OS. The hardware is ready, but the rest of the Android ecosystem still needs to catch up. The first version of Android to support 64-bit apps will be Android L, which is due out sometime this year. Hopefully HTC takes advantage of its forward-looking hardware and updates the OS. When full 64-bit support does come, it won&apos;t just be about more memory; the\u00a0ARMv8 instruction set that comes with the new architecture also offers a performance boost. In the iPhone 5S, 64-bit ARMv8 CPU benchmarks run about 30% faster than 32-bit ARMv7 benchmarks on the same hardware.  Use of sapphire in smartphones may take off in 2015, say Taiwan makers &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Following the use of sapphire to make covers for the home button and camera of the iPhone 5, China- and South Korea-based smartphone vendors are considering the adoption of sapphire, and therefore the application in smartphones is likely to take off in 2015, according to Taiwan-based sapphire makers. LG Electronics has also adopted sapphire for covers of smartphone cameras and China-based smartphone vendors ZTE, Huawei Device and Xiaomi Technology as well as Samsung Electronics are very likely to follow suit, the sources said.

I used to love my job but after a couple of years it became repetitive and there are no career development opportunities. I still produce the same quality of work but I\u2019ve lost my motivation. I wouldn\u2019t like to stay in the same job for ever, although the money is good and\u00a0I love my colleagues. I recently got a qualification in a more specialised area of psychology and I would love to get into that field as it\u2019s varied and challenging, but I have no relevant experience. I think the difficult part is to find a job with a similar salary, as most of the suitable jobs out there are graduate positions. On the other hand, I know that there are a large number of employees who are not happy with their job but, because it offers security and a decent income, they decide to stay and that this is quite a common phenomenon. So, should I take the next step and find a more fulfilling job, hopefully relevant to my recently obtained qualification, even if the salary is lower? Or should I stay and accept the fact that work doesn\u2019t need to be pleasant? Jeremy says You don\u2019t say how old you are, but from the sound of it you\u2019re still in your 20s or early 30s. Even now, the only factors that make your job tolerable are agreeable colleagues, a good salary and a sense of security. Important as they are, they really mustn\u2019t deter you from seeking out a role that you would find inherently\u00a0interesting. It\u2019s easy enough for me to stand on the sidelines and encourage you to take risks, but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what you need to do. I\u2019m not even sure that the risks are that great, as the greater risk lies with the alternative: you opt for security and another year or two slip by. You\u2019re less and less enamoured of your job \u2013 but find it harder and harder to summon up the energy and determination to do anything about it. So, as with all undemanding and repetitive tasks, your standards start to slip. The chances are that others will notice, too. And to add to your unhappiness, that psychology qualification you so admirably acquired, but never put to use, becomes ever less current and so ever less valuable. I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ve been through all this in your head many times. What I\u2019m strongly advising you to do now is confront it openly and make a decision to change direction. To harden your resolve, tell at least one person of that decision and even put a deadline on it. Then go for it. It\u2019s not too late \u2013 and, unlike many others who are stuck in a similar situation, you\u2019re lucky enough to know exactly the kind of work you\u2019d rather to be doing. It won\u2019t be easy and it won\u2019t be quick and it\u2019s true that you may well have to settle, at least initially, for a lower salary. But what you\u2019ll gain in return will be beyond price. Readers say \u2022 Leave \u2013 money is nothing compared to job satisfaction. I just changed jobs and cut one fifth of my wage, but I\u2019m much, much happier. Also, I\u2019ve found that you adapt \u2013 when I was earning more I was wasting the extra income on stuff I didn\u2019t really need.

Why, if you didn\u2019t intend, or at least hope, that you\u2019d use it? You want to move, you\u2019ve picked up the \u201ctools\u201d to do so. Go and use them, and it\u2019s highly likely that you\u2019ll soon catch up any temporary loss of income. quonky  \u2022 Chuck your job. Thinking this way always ends in a resignation letter. So, if in a few years you may feel another need to change, fine. fizzdarling  \u2022 I had a well-paid office job in 1999. It made me ill and unhappy. I went on holiday \u2013 long walks in the Austrian countryside \u2013 and came back with the resolve and strength to hand in my notice. Fifteen years later, I am working in a different field and it took me 10 years to gain any sort of confidence. But, oh!, I am so much happier. nina1414 After 17 years as a Tefl\u00a0teacher in Taiwan, what can I do now?  After 17 years in Taiwan as a Tefl teacher, I made the break. I could never face teaching again and need a complete change. As I spent so much time abroad I had little chance to try other careers and now, after a year, I can only come up with accountancy or perhaps catering. I do know that cooking professionally can be stressful, so I\u2019m not even sure about that. I did enquire about being a gas engineer but I was told that finding full-time employment at the end of the \u00a37,000 course was virtually impossible. Without a skill, and at my age, nobody will consider me.  Jeremy says Instead of thinking of your 17 years in teaching as time wasted, turn them to your advantage. Instead of trying to think of conventional UK jobs and careers you might be suitable for, go searching for companies, educational establishments and import-export advisers, who might find someone with your knowledge and experience, exactly what they were looking for. I know it sounds unlikely, and there won\u2019t be many of them, but you don\u2019t need many. Scour the internet for any UK-based organisations that have links with Taiwan. Presumably you have fluent Mandarin \u2013 and maybe other dialects. Join LinkedIn and other job-related websites. Compose an ad for yourself and resist the temptation to give it broad \u2013 and therefore unspecific \u2013 appeal. Make it almost absurdly personal. Then, given the interest shown recently in Asian education systems, and whether they place excessive pressure on students and undue emphasis on mathematics and science at the expense of creativity, write your own informed assessment of the differences between the UK\u2019s approach and that of Taiwan \u2013 or, more broadly, China. In short, use the internet to start making a small name for yourself in your own specialised area. Readers say \u2022 If you speak and read Chinese you would be much sought-after for a firm exporting to those markets in a sales or consultancy role. Elainenz \u2022 I was in a similar situation when I came back from some time abroad \u2013 Tefl paid so badly I started washing-up for a local catering company and it actually paid more. So I worked my way up, from event staff and then manager, and now work full-time, dealing with clients, sales, admin, logistics, staffing, website etc \u2013 but not doing the cooking. It is still a bit stressy at times, but rewarding, too. jewell79 \u2022 If you are interested in accounting, check out AAT and CIMA websites. Get qualified and it\u2019s a decent salary. ID725569 \u2022 Mightn\u2019t it be that you\u2019re totally burnt out in Taiwan and could manage a year or two more in another region? Tefl teachers in the Middle East make an absolute packet. WinstonThatcher \u2022 Is there some other way you could use your language skills? I\u2019ve done some (admittedly unpaid) copy editing for English as a second language speakers.

While China has promised to introduce universal suffrage for elections of the next chief executive in 2017, the rigid framework announced on Sunday requires the screening of candidates and effectively ensures pro-democracy politicians cannot stand. Pan-democrat lawmakers in Hong Kong have vowed to vote down the plans. Some were escorted from the speech by Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the standing committee of the National People&apos;s Congress, after they and other demonstrators chanted slogans and held up placards reading &quot;shameful&quot; and accusing China of breaking its promise to introduce democratic freedoms. Police used pepper spray to stop a separate group of activists from storming the venue. The Occupy Central with Peace and Love movement has said it will take over the financial heart of Hong Kong at an unspecified date, in the culmination of a non-violent civil disobedience campaign. Several vehicles, some decorated with flags, launched a &quot;slow drive&quot; through the city on Monday. They were accompanied by police vehicles, but traffic was not noticeably disrupted. Activists also say students from 11 schools have committed to boycotting classes from mid-September. Li Fei warned his audience: &quot;Occupy Central is an illegal activity. If we give in, it will trigger more illegal activities.&quot; The South China Morning Post reported that he said voters would be &quot;confused&quot; by more than two or three candidates, adding: &quot;People may not know what they advocate and what they have achieved before.&quot; Limiting the numbers would &quot;guarantee genuine choice for voters&quot; while preventing the election from becoming &quot;too complicated and costly&quot;, Li said. If the plans fall in Hong Kong&apos;s legislative council, the current system will continue, with a committee of mostly pro-Beijing loyalists selecting the next leader. Britain showed little interest in democratic reforms until the dying days of colonial rule. But Hong Kong was handed back to China under a &quot;one country, two systems&quot; agreement that gave it freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, such as free speech and the right to protest. On the mainland, the state-run Global Times newspaper wrote that &quot;the radical opposition camp is doomed to be a paper tiger&quot;, quoting a phrase most associated with Mao Zedong. China Daily, an English language state newspaper, added that the people of Hong Kong had to choose whether &quot;to embrace a hitherto unprecedented level of democracy, or the disruptive, reckless political gamble to be staged by the radicals&quot;. While no one anticipated that Beijing would allow open nominations, the decision passed by the standing committee of the National People&apos;s Congress is particularly tough. It states that only two to three candidates are permitted and that each must win the backing of at least half of the nominating committee, which will be composed overwhelmingly of Beijing loyalists. &quot;I think that part of making this very uncompromising proposal is letting it be vetoed by the democrats and then blaming them for holding back reforms,&quot; said Ho-fung Hung of Johns Hopkins University, who has written on relations between the special administrative region and the mainland. But he suggested that China might issue reform proposals in future. &quot;I think the best thing for Beijing is really to set up a fake democratic system endorsed by the legislature of Hong Kong so that they can say, &apos;We have fulfilled the basic promises under the Sino-British declaration and Basic Law. The deal is done and you foreign countries don&apos;t have anything to do with Hong Kong any more.&apos; \u2026 It will close that space for criticism from the opposition in Hong Kong and the international community,&quot; he said. Hung added that the pan-democrat proportion of the overall vote was gradually slipping, suggesting that migration from the mainland and sustained efforts to integrate those migrants into the pro-establishment camp were having an impact. At the same time, pro-democracy voters were being radicalised and were more likely to see themselves as having a Hong Kong rather than Chinese identity. The Mainland Affairs Council in Taiwan, which has de facto independence, expressed &quot;regret&quot; at the NPC&apos;s decision. The opposition Democratic Progressive party said that deciding to limit the type and number of candidates for Hong Kong&apos;s election was a huge setback for the progress of Hong Kong&apos;s democracy."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/02/guardian-view-china-elections-hong-kong", "publicationDate": "2014-09-02T19:19:32Z", "tags": ["Hong Kong", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["It has sent exactly the wrong signal to Taiwan, where \u201cone country, two systems\u201d, the model Deng Xiaoping devised to ease Hong Kong back into the fold, remains the starting point for discussion of eventual reunification."], "title": "The Guardian view on China\u2019s rejection of open elections for the leader of Hong Kong | Editorial", "article": "Within hours of the Chinese government making it clear that the people of Hong Kong will not have a free choice when they vote to elect the territory\u2019s next chief executive, Hong Kong police had made their first arrests of demonstrators protesting against that decision. It is safe to predict that these will be the first of many, and that they presage a long period in which Hong Kong\u2019s institutions will increasingly lack legitimacy in the eyes of a substantial proportion of citizens. Demonstrating an unhappy combination of timidity and stupidity, Beijing has fashioned a rod to beat its own back. It has set itself on a path that will lead to confrontations between the Hong Kong security forces and large numbers of dismayed and angry people, particularly the middle class and the young. Even if these are suppressed, a resentful acquiescence is the best that can be expected to follow. It has also almost certainly undermined the territory\u2019s economic future, since traders and investors abhor instability and uncertainty. It has sent exactly the wrong signal to Taiwan, where \u201cone country, two systems\u201d, the model Deng Xiaoping devised to ease Hong Kong back into the fold, remains the starting point for discussion of eventual reunification. That model now looks like a very unreliable guide to the future. Beijing has also thumbed its nose at Britain, because what it has done contradicts the spirit, if not the letter, of the undertakings given in 1997 at the time of the handover of Hong Kong. In addition, the Chinese authorities have made the brazen demand that the British parliament abandon an inquiry into political developments in Hong Kong by the Commons foreign affairs committee. This inquiry, Beijing says, is a \u201chighly inappropriate act which constitutes interference in China\u2019s internal affairs\u201d. We could reasonably reply that China has broken the promises it made. But reasonableness is not a concept Beijing easily grasps. The people of Hong Kong are orderly and sensible folk. It is far-fetched to imagine they would vote for a candidate who proposed to defy Beijing. One who would stick up for Hong Kong\u2019s interests and traditions, yes. But one who would jeopardise them by flying in the face of the reality of where the city is and how it makes its living, no. It seems China cannot tolerate even the slightest risk. Beijing may be worried that other Chinese cities would see democratic freedoms in Hong Kong as a precedent, but that is a bridge it is going to have to cross sooner or later, anyway. There is perhaps a way in which the situation can be half rescued. Let the stacked selection committee re-stack itself to allow through a genuinely independent candidate for 2017. We strongly urge that on Beijing and hope this time it will not be seen as \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/05/apple-iwatch-iphone-6-launch", "publicationDate": "2014-09-05T17:30:56Z", "tags": ["Apple", "iPhone 6", "Computing", "Technology", "iPhone", "Mobile phones", "Telecoms", "Smartphones"], "sentences": ["According to the electronics industry newsletter Digitimes, which taps multiple manufacturing sources in China and Taiwan, the device remains in engineering verification testing, a preliminary stage before it goes into full manufacturing."], "title": "Apple's iWatch set to be unveiled at iPhone 6 launch", "article": "The iWatch, Apple&apos;s wearable computer, with a flexible screen and one-piece strap that snaps around the wrist and connects to an iPhone, is expected to be unveiled on Tuesday \u2013 but may not go on sale until 2015.

A patent filed by Apple in 2011 and published in February 2013 suggests the wristband would have wireless links, storage and flexible display, be able to link to an iPhone, and display maps and other information. Wearable computers that mimic the function of a watch, but also connect to smartphones to offer extra functionality, are a growing category, though still of niche interest. The research firm Kantar says only eight in every 1,000 consumers across the largest western economies, including the US and UK, own a smartwatch. But that proportion could soar, says Ben Wood, chief analyst at the research firm CCS Insight. &quot;This year there will be 1.3bn smartphones sold \u2013 if you can persuade even a tiny percentage to get a wearable too, the numbers get big pretty quickly.&quot; He thinks any launch of a wearable device from Apple will overshadow existing models from companies such as Samsung, LG and Motorola. &quot;Those have all been ugly black plastic, designed by engineers,&quot; he said. &quot;I think Apple will look to blend technology and fashion to make it more attractive.&quot; While photographs of the expected new iPhones have been leaked to websites in China and Australia, because their production lines have been making them by the million since mid-summer in China, nothing has appeared of the iWatch. According to the electronics industry newsletter Digitimes, which taps multiple manufacturing sources in China and Taiwan, the device remains in engineering verification testing, a preliminary stage before it goes into full manufacturing. Apple has shown off devices before selling them before: the iPhone was unveiled in January 2007 but went on sale in June that year; the iPad was first shown off in January 2010 but went on sale in the April. Wood says Apple&apos;s decision to unveil the device before it goes on sale would have triple benefits for the company \u2013 maximising the surprise of its unveiling, building demand before the launch, and torpedoing sales of rival devices from companies such as Samsung, LG and Motorola, all of which announced new smartwatches this week at the IFA trade fair in Berlin. &quot;It&apos;s about controlling the message,&quot; Wood said of the expected gap between announcement and release. &quot;Apple has planned hard on this, and rather than going to mass manufacturing, where there seem always to be people who will leak components for their 15 minutes of fame, they are looking for a &apos;wow&apos; factor.&quot; Multiple details have been leaked about the new iPhones \u2013 including that they will have larger, sapphire-treated screens and more rounded edges than current models. Apple is also expected to introduce a mobile payment function into the new phones and the wearable device.

The explanations are also similar: a long innings (seven years in Cheshire&apos;s case, 10 in King&apos;s), a business facing new challenges, the need to commit for the long term, etcetera. It is a vague but plausible tale: these days a long reign for a FTSE 100 chief executive tends to be defined as five years. Cheshire inherited less of a mess than King, but Kingfisher in 2008 was not in a pretty state. The UK&apos;s DIY boom of the 1980s and 1990s, which made B&amp;Q one of the great roll-out stories of that era, was a faded memory; recession was arriving; and too much corporate energy had been wasted on failed foreign experiments in South Korea and Taiwan. Cheshire&apos;s first act was to chop the dividend in half, slash capital expenditure and seek cost savings via making the components, including Castorama in France, buy goods and IT systems centrally. Textbook stuff, in other words, but its execution had evaded previous management. Within six months, Kingfisher&apos;s share price had slipped below 100p. It is now 319p, which is one measure of how far self-help can take a retailer with market-leading positions in the UK and France. Another yardstick is cash: Cheshire inherited net debts of \u00a31.55bn but Kingfisher now has net cash of almost \u00a3500m and can dabble in share buy-backs and special dividends. That is an impressive turnaround, even taking account of the flattering effect of selling Castorama Italy in 2009 for \u00a3550m-ish. The only blemish on Cheshire&apos;s record is China, where B&amp;Q never worked. Damage limitation reduced annual losses from \u00a350m to breakeven, but losses were back at \u00a311m in yesterday&apos;s half-year numbers. A local joint partner is being sought, which is what UK retailers usually do when China exhausts them. The only consolation is that Kingfisher has made roughly as much money from rising Chinese property prices as it has lost from actually trading the stores. The new chief executive is V\u00e9ronique Laury, head of Castorama in France. She has a low profile among shareholders as she is not currently on Kingfisher&apos;s main board, but she is the senior front-line retailer within the group and thus the obvious pick. Euan Sutherland, former head of B&amp;Q who departed last year to run (and then quit) the Co-op Group, may be kicking himself; he would have been a contender.

Verit\u00e9\u2019s investigations found that workers were forced to live in cramped and dangerous accommodation, that female workers experienced sexual abuse by their supervisors, and migrants were forced to work excessive overtime under the threat of losing their jobs, which would leave them saddled with large debts they couldn\u2019t pay off. A large number of multinational companies from the US, Europe, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea use Malaysia as their manufacturing base. In 2013, more than $2.6bn (\u00a31.6bn) of investment originated from overseas. \u201cWhat was most shocking to us was that this was happening in modern facilities, some of which were owned and operated by major international brands,\u201d said Dan Viederman, chief executive of Verit\u00e9. \u201cThis work has led us to conclude that forced labour in this industry is systemic and that every company operating in this sector in Malaysia faces a high risk of forced labour in their operations.\u201d Thousands of people from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Vietnam and other countries travel to Malaysia every year for work. According to a 2010 Amnesty International report, many enter the workplace at least $1,000 in debt, after being charged high fees by recruitment agents. The vast majority of workers interviewed by Verit\u00e9 were found to have been charged excessive fees by recruitment agencies, both in their home countries and in Malaysia. Verit\u00e9\u2019s investigation revealed that 77% of migrant workers had to borrow money for recruitment fees. Some 95% of those interviewed said they didn\u2019t feel they could leave their jobs until they had paid off their debts. Their situation was made worse after a 2013 change in Malaysian law made it possible for employers to pass on the cost of a per-capita levy the government charges on the use of foreign labour to the workers themselves, increasing their debt by almost $400. The interviews revealed that although it is illegal under Malaysian law, more than 90% of workers had their passports taken by managers at their place of work or by recruitment agents, with most saying they were unable to get them back. This year the US state department downgraded Malaysia to the lowest tier of its Trafficking in Persons report, which ranks countries on efforts to end modern-day slavery. In the report, the state department criticised Malaysia for widespread abuse of its 4 million migrant workforce. Most of the electronics workers interviewed by Verit\u00e9 said they had been detained, harassed, blackmailed or threatened by immigration officials, police or the much-feared Rela, Malaysia\u2019s voluntary citizen security corps, which is charged with rooting out illegal migrants. Verit\u00e9 refuses to name brands it found to be using forced labour to produce goods, because it fears that would be counterproductive to its mission to create greater accountability in supply chains. \u201cWe didn\u2019t go into this research looking to name and shame,\u201d Viederman said. \u201cWhat we are concerned about is that the use of forced labour is absolutely systemic and that any company that produces or sources electronics from Malaysia must work to ensure that they are proactively taking actions to eliminate that risk.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/17/human-rights-china-corporate-responsbility-taiwan-hong-kong", "publicationDate": "2014-09-17T15:15:47Z", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "China", "Human rights", "Ethical business", "Coal", "Taiwan", "Hong Kong", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Recently the headlines in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong have been full of the scandal of the Taiwanese firm Chang Guann, which supplied cooking oil blended with \u201cgutter oil\u201d (recycled waste from sources like restaurant drains and discarded animal parts)."], "title": "Signs human rights are moving slowly up the agenda in corporate China", "article": "Recently the headlines in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong have been full of the scandal of the Taiwanese firm Chang Guann, which supplied cooking oil blended with \u201cgutter oil\u201d (recycled waste from sources like restaurant drains and discarded animal parts). The oil products containing high levels of carcinogens were being used by over 900 restaurants in the region. The company was fined TW$50 million (\u00a31m). The head of Chang Guann, Yeh Wen-hsiang, apologised and drank a cup of the oil. Such food safety scandals are just one example of the negligence of human rights (in this case the right to health) by companies in the region. The poor working conditions for millions of migrant workers at Chinese suppliers to big electronic brands such as Apple and Samsung, and repeating episodes of protests against major power plants over displacement and pollution are signs of growing public discontent about corporate behaviour. These problems \u2013 and what to do about them \u2013 are likely to come up in conversations this week as executives gather for the 2014 CSR Asia Summit in Hong Kong. There are, however, some promising signs among Chinese companies of their openness to dealing with human rights issues. Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre\u2019s new briefing on business and human rights in the Greater China region found a 50% response rate from Chinese firms to specific human rights concerns raised by civil society.  While lower than the 77% response rate from multinationals headquartered elsewhere that operate in Greater China, the Chinese firms were more likely to respond in detail: 52% of their responses address each part of an allegation, rather than a generic response. Only 38% of responses from non-Chinese companies operating in the region were provided in such point-by-point fashion. Chinese firms will act when they see a clear motivation to do so. This motivation can come from the desire to avoid further NGO campaigns or protests, from a stronger regulatory environment within China, and also, when it comes to investments overseas, the need to remain competitive with companies from other regions. Shenhua Group, China\u2019s biggest coal firm, faced campaigns by Greenpeace and pressure from local government officials over its extraction of groundwater and claims it was discharging wastewater in Inner Mongolia. Following the campaign, it engaged in a series of dialogues with Greenpeace, and said it would reduce its groundwater extraction and invest in major wastewater treatment facilities. This was the first time Greenpeace challenged a state-owned-enterprise in China. For a huge corporation backed up by enormous financial support, this is a good example that Chinese companies are capable of changing their environmental or social practices when they have the motivation. There is a Chinese saying, \u201cyou don\u2019t realise the pain until the needle pierces your flesh\u201d. Various laws within China have been strengthened to put the \u201cneedle\u201d into the companies\u2019 \u201cflesh\u201d, to reinforce the need to avoid human rights abuses. This includes the toughening of environmental laws and food safety laws this year, to increase penalties for offenders and compensation for victims. That said, civil society groups often question whether these laws will be effectively or evenly enforced, and whether they are sufficient to protect the full spectrum of human rights. For instance, some are calling for an anti-discrimination law \u2013 which is technically still absent in China. Victims of corporate-related human rights harms often face major challenges to securing compensation, the litigation processes are sometimes long and fraught with hurdles. Outside China, Chinese firms are also facing increasing activism over their social and environmental impacts. China National Petroleum Corporation\u2019s pipeline projects in Burma have faced allegations of land grabs, while China International Water &amp; Electricity Corporation\u2019s Lom Pangar dam in Cameroon has been accused of providing cramped living conditions and limited drinking water suppliers for construction workers on China. In both these cases, we obtained a detailed public response from the companies. While both mostly denied the allegations put to them, their detailed responses show a new willingness to engage. Communication flows and monitoring of social and environmental risks between Chinese firms\u2019 overseas operations and their mainland headquarters are often limited \u2013 so increased efforts to escalate overseas concerns to the attention of headquarters and push for responses are important. In the light of increasing scrutiny on Chinese companies\u2019 misconducts overseas, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) has also issued guidelines on CSR for state-owned enterprises and set up a corresponding social responsibility steering committee. There is also a need for greater training and awareness-building of business and human rights management and the existing tools that are already available, so that disparate existing initiatives can be replicated and scaled up. Among these are a project by China National Textile &amp; Apparel Council to highlight gaps between the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and actual practices at six factories \u2013 with guidance on how to develop effective grievance mechanisms. Social Resources Institute (SRI), a Chinese NGO, has also issued a report based on the Guiding Principles about non-judicial grievance procedures in factories. And in 2013, the Global Business Initiative along with local and international partners hosted a business executive\u2019s meeting and practitioner\u2019s roundtable on human rights. All these are movements in the right direction. In the face of major challenges, a combination of continued scrutiny from civil society and progressive action by companies will help advance respect for human rights by business in the Greater China region.

In the minds of the people, however, Americans are all freedom fighters, stripped to the waist and armed to the teeth, genetically eager to liberate something.  Stop an American on the street and ask them what they think of Scottish independence, and you will likely be greeted with a smiling confession of ignorance, before dislodging a general statement of support, along the lines of \u201cFreedom! Good!\u201d If it\u2019s ditching Britain we\u2019re talking about, all the better.  The sentiment may be superficial, but underlying it is a real historical sympathy, rooted in America\u2019s own revolutionary tradition. Here are 10 ways that the Scottish referendum is like the American revolution \u2013 and a few ways the analogy breaks down. 1. The Scots are involved Many Scots had settled in the American colonies before the revolution, and some even fought on the Patriots\u2019 side. The first federal census, in 1790, recorded an estimated 160,000 people of Scottish descent in America (although the number is sketchy). Among them was navy captain John Paul Jones, born in lovely Kirkcudbright, who once yelled, as all American schoolchildren learn, \u201cI have not yet begun to fight!\u201d There\u2019s a caveat here: most Scots attached to the colonies, notably including the national heroine Flora MacDonald, appear to have been loyalists to the British crown. 2. Borrowed philosophies The revolutionary Americans were not the first people to cry out freedom. In fact, 450 years before there was the Declaration of Independence (1776), there was the Declaration of Arbroath (1320), which affirmed Scotland\u2019s independence from England and which some scholars credit with influencing the American announcement. The Scottish document has an evergreen quality, especially in light of Thursday\u2019s vote. \u201cFor, as long as but a hundred of us remain alive, never will we on any conditions be brought under English rule,\u201d it reads. There\u2019s a caveat here: it was written in Latin. 3. Britain is in debt Britain exited the Seven Years War in 1763 with a victory over France, and a large pile of debt \u2013 about \u00a3130m \u2013 to go with it. The solution, to raise taxes on the New World colonies, ended up creating an even bigger problem for the crown. The United Kingdom today is in comparably miserable fiscal shape, with a national debt of around 91% of GDP (\u00a31.5tn). Crucial to relieving that debt is the \u00a34.7bn- \u00a36bn annually (the figure swings) that the Treasury in London collects in tax revenue on oil and gas extraction, mostly from Scottish territorial waters. Guess who thinks too little of that cash flow ends up in Scotland. 4. Taxation The American colonies were incensed not only by the fact of British taxation but by its nature. The taxes seemed unjust and punitive. \u201cThis we apprehend annihilates our charter right to govern &amp; tax ourselves,\u201d the Boston revolutionary Samuel Adams wrote of the Sugar Act of 1764. A parallel outrage fueled the rise of the Scottish national party, after the imposition in April 1989 by the Thatcher government of the so-called \u2018poll tax\u2019, which demanded a sum per individual instead of a share of income. Alex Salmond has called it \u201cone of the most blatant examples of the democratic deficit that fuelled that home rule campaign through the 1990s.\u201d The year after it was passed, Salmond was elevated as leader of the SNP.

Without representation It was the colonies\u2019 argument that they should not have to remit money to the crown on purchases of paper, sugar, molasses, tea and other goods if they did not have a vote in parliament to spend the revenue. Scottish nationalists argue that they are not much better represented in Westminster today. Progressive Scottish politicians were shut out of the Thatcher and Major governments. The conservative party, the party of the current prime minister, holds just one of 59 Scottish seats in the House of Commons. In an attempt to head off a yes vote, England has promised Scotland an expanded home rule through greater tax-and-spending powers. 6. Hosting a foreign military A prime driver of colonial angst was the Quartering Acts, which required Americans to billet British soldiers. The colonists hated the practice so much they would end up devoting an entire constitutional amendment to banning it. Scotland today has complaints of its own against an imperial military presence in its territory, in this case the the four nuclear submarines and missiles and warheads based at Faslane naval base under the Trident program. \u201c Trident is an affront to basic decency with its indiscriminate and inhumane destructive power,\u201d a white paper statement on Scotland\u2019s Future put it. Scotland may need to keep the missiles in place, however, as a condition for joining Nato. 7. English arrogance English officers in the revolutionary era appraised the American soldiery as \u201ccowardly dogs,\u201d while the colonists were described as a \u201cpoor species of fighting men\u201d suffering \u201ca want of bravery,\u201d noted the historian John Ferling. Then the Brits went to war and lost. Whatever the outcome of Thursday\u2019s vote, prime minister David Cameron will be remembered for a supremely misplaced confidence in the weakness of his adversaries. He could have engineered a compromise vote granting Scotland a measure of independence without destroying the United Kingdom. \u201cHowever, hubris and an arrogant \u2018How could they possibly want to do things differently?\u2019 mentality prevailed instead,\u201d MP Jonathan Edwards recently observed. 8. English surprise Not unrelated to the foregoing. In 1764, the British generals were confident they could put down the ragtag band of colonial military forces, should it come to that; for one thing, they had a navy. The surprise that followed could have a contemporary echo. Just two years ago, in October 2012, Cameron casually signed the Edinburgh agreement, which set up Thursday\u2019s vote. \u2018I always wanted to show respect to the people of Scotland,\u201d he said at the time. Then a shock poll two weeks ago showed Yes in the lead, and the three Westminster party leaders \u2013 Cameron, Clegg and Miliband \u2013 scrambled to Scotland for a belated campaign against independence. Cameron nearly wept. 9. An improvised revolution If the Scottish national party loses, it may be because the leadership failed to instil confidence in the populace that they had a clear plan for 19 September. \u201cThe SNP have hopelessly underestimated the scale and complexity of this,\u201d said Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader. \u201cThey would have to negotiate over 14,000 international treaties, a currency, the division of assets, membership of Nato and the host of international organisations.\u201d Not to worry, the American example would seem to say. The Continental army \u2013 \u201cRaw, and undisciplined recruits\u201d, their leader, George Washington, called them \u2013 was outnumbered and fighting under a flag that commanded questionable loyalty. They won anyway. 10. Mel Gibson nailed it It is perhaps the strongest argument against voting yes for an independent Scotland that the position seems heartily commended in the oeuvre of Mel Gibson. People have heard enough in the last week about Braveheart. Not everyone is familiar, however, with Gibson\u2019s remarkably similar turn in the 2000 movie The Patriot, an impressively sappy film set during the American Revolution:            On the other hand\u2026 It would be reckless not to allude to the basic ways in which the analogy between revolutionary America and contemporary Scotland breaks down. They are voting on it instead of having a war A significant distinction. Scotland is keeping the queen Early in the independence campaign, the SNP promised that an independent Scotland would keep the queen and the pound, the national health service and some version of the BBC. It remains to be seen how many of those promises would be fulfilled if independence happens. Representation without taxation An inversion of the most famous of colonial complaints against the crown. If the vote is Yes, it appears that Scotland will pass through a period in which it is not remitting taxes to the United Kingdom \u2013 but is maintaining a presence in parliament. Establishing independence would be expected to take until 2016 at least. But there is a British general election, likely delivering a Labor government, next year. Fifty-nine Scottish MPs may end up serving in a foreign government."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/20/philippines-evacuates-thousands-tropical-storm-fung-wong", "publicationDate": "2014-09-20T09:50:56Z", "tags": ["Philippines", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Flooding", "Environment"], "sentences": ["Fung-Wong is expected to leave Philippine territory by Sunday and track toward Taiwan and southern Japan."], "title": "Philippines evacuates thousands as tropical storm Fung-Wong hits", "article": "More than 205,000 people have been evacuated in the Philippines as a tropical storm brought flooding to Manila and nearby provinces. The storm, which battered the country&apos;s northernmost provinces on Friday, has claimed at least five lives so far and gained strength on Saturday with torrential monsoon rains and strong winds. The national disaster risk reduction and management council reported that tropical storm Fung-Wong had affected more than 700,000 people in metropolitan Manila and northern and central provinces, forcing more than 205,000 to evacuate. Imee Marcos, the governor of Ilocos Norte province in the north-west of the main island of Luzon, said 12 hours of fierce winds and heavy rains had blown off roofs, toppled trees and flooded highways. &quot;I am basically holed up in my bedroom with a generator and several computers and telephones because I can&apos;t even cross the street,&quot; she told the Associated Press on Saturday. &quot;I told everyone to hunker down. There is very little we can do,&quot; she said. Marcos said there were no immediate reports of casualties, that rescue workers were en route to those trapped by the flooding, and relief supplies were being distributed. &quot;Every time there is a little rain we have trouble, and now this is more than a little rain so it&apos;s really been difficult,&quot; Marcos said, adding that the last time the province had experienced something similar was 10 years ago. At least 86,000 people were displaced in Manila on Friday, as Fung-Wong flooded the ground floors of many homes, forcing residents to seek refuge on upper floors and rooftops. The rain and an unrelated radar malfunction combined to divert, delay or cancel dozens of domestic and international flights at the capital&apos;s airport. Government offices in the capital and 15 provinces were closed on Friday and the Philippine stock exchange suspended trading. Government forecasters said nearly a month&apos;s worth of rain fell overnight. Aldczar Aurelio, a meteorologist, said the storm, which made landfall in northern Cagayan province with winds of more than 60 miles (100km) an hour, strengthened the seasonal south-west monsoon winds and cloud formation from the Indian Ocean and Australia. He said 26.8cm (10.5 inches) of rain fell on the capital in a 24-hour period ending early on Friday, more than half the amount that caused the worst flooding in metropolitan Manila for 40 years in 2009. Fung-Wong is expected to leave Philippine territory by Sunday and track toward Taiwan and southern Japan.

Total European farm exports to Russia are worth some \u20ac11bn a year, with 29% of all fresh fruit and veg grown in the union and 33% of all cheese finding its way to the Russian market. Copa-Cogeca, the umbrella group representing European farmers, says prices in both sectors have fallen by as much as 80% in some countries. It is calling for urgent help from Brussels: funds to compensate growers facing difficulties, but also action to help cut the red tape and trade regulations that can prevent European growers from selling into alternative world markets in south America, north Africa and the far east. In the meantime, though, fruit is withering on trees and vegetables are rotting in the ground.  Poland Polish apples are among the worst affected. Last year, Polish growers sold around \u20ac840m of fresh produce to Russia, including 700,000 tonnes of apples \u2013 a quarter of its entire crop. According to the Polish Fruit Union, prices have fallen so far that farmers, assuming they can sell, are only just covering their costs. And the knock-on effect of thousands of tonnes of cheap Polish apples flooding on to western European markets is starting to hurt growers in France, too. While touting their wares in countries as far afield as Algeria, Taiwan, India and Singapore, Poland\u2019s farmers have high hopes of persuading American consumers to buy Polish \u201cFreedom Apples\u201d. Greece Greece exported 160,000 tonnes of fruit to Russia last year, worth around \u20ac180m to the country\u2019s struggling economy. But when 250 truckloads of peaches and nectarines on their way to Russia were turned back from the border in August, the produce either rotted or was sold at knockdown prices to buyers in countries on the way back. Incofruit-Hellas, the Greek fruit export association, says it is now seriously worried that oversupply will end up hitting the entire fresh produce market at a time when Greece desperately needs the money. Netherlands Dutch fruit and vegetable sales to Russia were worth some \u20ac600m in 2013, says the Frugi Venta trade association \u2013 which represents 420 Dutch companies. But prices for some products have now fallen by 75-80%, and hundreds of trucks have been turned back. Growers in Holland fear prices for aubergines, peppers, tomatoes and cucumbers will collapse within months, while some 900 hectares of Dutch fruit orchards \u2013 particularly pears \u2013 may be left unpicked this autumn because sale prices will not cover the cost of harvesting. Spain The Spanish lemon growers\u2019 organisation Ailimpo is confident Moscow\u2019s ban should not affect the early part of its season, since lemon exports to Russia generally get underway in March and sales there only represent about 3% of Spain\u2019s total output.

The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) blamed new anti-extravagance drives in China, the stronger pound and an economic slowdown in some markets for the decline in Asia and the Americas, two of the industry\u2019s fastest-growing regions. The association said exports of blended and malt whisky fell from \u00a32bn in the first six months of 2013 to \u00a31.77bn for the same period this year \u2013 the largest half-yearly decline in 15 years. The figures present a significant headache for the SWA\u2019s recently appointed chief executive, David Frost, who said the drop proved the UK government had to continue bringing down trade barriers and restrictions. The association is expected to ramp up pressure for a 2% cut in excise duty. Frost also said it would start consulting its members, dominated by global drinks giants such as Diageo, Pernod Ricard and Suntory, over the tax and regulatory reforms that could follow greater devolution for Scotland. \u201cThe latest figures also act as a reminder that the success of scotch whisky can\u2019t be taken for granted. We need support from government to beat down trade barriers and help us access new markets overseas,\u201d Frost said. \u201cThat is why we are determined to play a full part in the forthcoming debate about further devolution, so that it enables a supportive business environment to ensure the future success of scotch whisky.\u201d The association said it would study the UK and Scottish government proposals for greater devolution after last week\u2019s independence referendum, in which voters chose to remain in the UK by 55% to 45%. A spokeswoman refused to speculate on the powers that could be handed over to the Scottish parliament. The ruling Scottish National party in the devolved government in Edinburgh has previously raised the prospect of devolving excise duty and has recently pushed hard to devolve corporation tax. The latest figures end a long period of booming sales and export records as whisky sales expanded rapidly in South America, particularly Brazil, and south-east Asia. The association said sales in China, where scotch is regarded among the newly rich as a symbol of significant affluence and status, had fallen 35%, down from \u00a325m to \u00a315m. While that puts China only 28th in the global rankings for whisky sales, the Chinese market is also supplied heavily via Singapore, which saw its whisky imports collapse by 46% from \u00a3174m to \u00a394m. Sales also fell 16% in the US to \u00a3328m, 46% in Singapore to \u00a394m, 19% in Brazil to \u00a340m, 27% in Mexico to \u00a339m and by 22% in Germany to \u00a365m, marking a significant reversal in fortunes in those markets. The SWA said the first half of any year tended to be quieter than the second half, primarily because of market cycles and festivals such as Christmas that fall late in the year. The association\u2019s spokeswoman confirmed, however, that this was the most significant half-year drop since 1999, when sales fell by 14%. There have been other half-yearly declines, with modest falls in 2012 and 2009, but they were made up for by sales in the second half of those years. The SWA added that sales increased in some important new and traditional markets: in Taiwan up by 39% to \u00a391m, in Japan by 18% to \u00a332.5m, in the UAE by 26% to \u00a354m - because it acts as a distribution hub to other markets - in India by 31% to \u00a336m and in France by 6% to \u00a3211m. France is the industry\u2019s biggest market by volume. The association highlighted sales growth in the \u201cdifficult market\u201d of India, where the UK government and the SWA have been in open conflict over counterfeiting and import barriers. India also has a popular indigenous whisky industry in competition with Scotch. Frost said: \u201cWe are confident that Scotch whisky will continue to grow in the long-term as markets stabilise and new ones, such as emerging economies across Africa, open up. However, it is clear that in the short-run that there are economic headwinds affecting exports.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/23/elephant-killings-industrialised-scale-illegal-ivory-trade", "publicationDate": "2014-09-23T14:52:25Z", "tags": ["Illegal wildlife trade", "Conservation", "Wildlife", "WWF", "Environment", "Mozambique", "Africa", "Animals", "World news"], "sentences": ["Ivory from Mozambique has been traced to markets in Hong Kong and Taiwan, but trinkets and carvings are also sold at craft markets in Maputo, the meeting heard."], "title": "Elephant killings in Mozambique happening on \u2018industrialised\u2019 scale", "article": "Elephant poaching is happening on an unprecedented and \u201cindustrialised\u201d scale in Mozambique, environmentalists have warned, after 22 of the animals were killed for their tusks in the first two weeks of September. The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) said organised crime syndicates are slaughtering between 1,500 and 1,800 elephants a year in the southern African country, feeding demand for ivory in the far east. There are fears that Mozambique\u2019s elephant herds could be extinct within a decade. The crisis, described by the WCS as a \u201cnational disaster\u201d, was discussed during a two-day meeting of Mozambican officials, law enforcement agents and diplomats in the capital, Maputo. Carlos Pareira, an adviser to the New York-based WCS, told the seminar of the worsening situation in Niassa, the country\u2019s biggest game reserve, where \u201cin the first two weeks of September alone we counted 22 elephants that had been killed.\u201d The Niassa reserve, co-managed by the WCS with the Mozambican authorities, is double the size of South Africa\u2019s popular Kruger national park. Pareira added: \u201cThe killing of elephants in the north of Mozambique \u2026 is reaching proportions never seen before. The killing of elephants is being industrialised.\u201d Poachers use automatic weapons and high-calibre hunting rifles to kill the animals, the meeting heard. In the northern Tete province, they poison drinking water sources, killing not only elephants, while spikes concealed in the bush have also been used to wound animals in the coastal Querimbas reserve, causing them slow and agonising deaths from gangrene. Between 480 and 900 elephants died in the Querimbas between 2011 and 2013, according to a recent aerial study commissioned by the WWF. Ivory from Mozambique has been traced to markets in Hong Kong and Taiwan, but trinkets and carvings are also sold at craft markets in Maputo, the meeting heard. Mozambique has previously been criticised by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species as one of the world\u2019s worst failures in combating poaching and threatened with sanctions. Poaching was not considered a crime until recently, and anyone arrested often got off with a fine for illegal weapons possession. A new law passed in June toughens penalties for poaching, including hefty fines and jail terms of up to 12 years for killing protected species. Although the new conservation law was approved in June, it will only go into effect at the end of the year, officials said. Douglas Griffiths, the US ambassador to Mozambique, described the law as a \u201ccrucial step\u201d, but said the government would need to \u201censure it is respected by all and fully implemented\u201d. An estimated 25,000 elephants are killed every year in Africa for their tusks, double the number killed in 2007. A global march demanding action to stop elephant and rhino poaching will be held across 125 cities on 4 October."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/25/aviation-insurance-claims-rise-lloyds-of-london", "publicationDate": "2014-09-25T14:53:55Z", "tags": ["Insurance industry", "Lloyd's", "Airline industry", "Business", "Plane crashes", "Air transport", "World news"], "sentences": ["Aviation disasters in the second half of the year included the shooting down of another Malaysia Airlines plane, flight MH17, above eastern Ukraine in July, attacks on Tripoli international airport, the loss of an Air Alg\u00e9rie flight to Mali and the crash of a TransAsia Airways plane in Taiwan."], "title": "Aviation insurance claims have risen after string of disasters, says Lloyd\u2019s", "article": "The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and other losses this year have increased aviation insurance claims to 10 times the cost of annual premiums, Lloyd\u2019s of London said. Global insurance premiums to protect aircraft and other aviation assets are about $65m (\u00a340m) a year but claims could already be more than $600m, the world\u2019s biggest insurance market said. \u201cThe most notable claims have arisen from the unusually high incidence of aviation losses, which have been sudden and tragic,\u201d Lloyd\u2019s chairman, John Nelson, and chief executive, Inga Beale, said in a statement. A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200 disappeared in March with 239 people on board and has still not been found. Lloyd\u2019s insurers have already paid out for the loss of the plane but there have been further disasters in the past six months. Lloyd\u2019s said the wider market for catastrophes was benign in the first half of this year, helping profits for the six months to June increase to \u00a31.67bn from \u00a31.38bn a year earlier. But it said market conditions were getting more difficult. Aviation disasters in the second half of the year included the shooting down of another Malaysia Airlines plane, flight MH17, above eastern Ukraine in July, attacks on Tripoli international airport, the loss of an Air Alg\u00e9rie flight to Mali and the crash of a TransAsia Airways plane in Taiwan. \u201cIn a period when premium rates have generally fallen, most notably in the reinsurance space, this is a reminder of why pricing must reflect the underlying risks which are being written,\u201d Nelson and Beale said. They said insurance prices were under pressure because, with interest rates low, investors were putting extra capital into the industry. Lloyd\u2019s insurers have generally resisted the temptation to write insurance contracts too cheaply, they added. \u201cWhile the Lloyd\u2019s market has again benefited from a lower level of major claims activity, this intensifies the competitive pressures and the outlook of a continued weakening pricing environment remains,\u201d Lloyd\u2019s said. Conflicts in Russia, eastern Ukraine, Libya and the Middle East have not triggered big losses so far at Lloyd\u2019s but business from those regions has decreased. Companies are increasingly insuring themselves against cyber-attacks and are asking for wider coverage and bigger limits.

We inherit the same defensiveness seen in every high-level political exchange, where some great western power shakes their finger like a nagging teacher and Chinese leaders \u2013 feeling much aggrieved \u2013 stamp their feet in a huff. \u201cThis play is all about China \u2013 right up your alley!\u201d a friend said, just before Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s Kryptonite began. Internally, I was in brace mode. Over the next 15 minutes I slowly, cautiously, began to relax into the hands of writer Sue Smith, who has clearly been flexing her research chops. We are introduced to a pair of university classmates, Dylan (Tim Walter) and Lian (Ursula Mills), who will meet at various points over the next 25 years, each meeting sending them in new trajectories, like pinballs colliding. The Australian Dylan and Chinese Lian embody for each another (with mutual exoticisation) the good, bad and ugly of their respective nations. Dylan with his \u201ccurling, gold\u201d leg hair has a looseness that\u2019s seductive to Lian. But when his political demonstrations reveal more larrikinism than conviction, he comes off as flippantly narcissistic. \u201cI just wanted to get naked and put a rocket under this complacent joint,\u201d he tells Lian. She is serious, but not without humour; a glowing optimist with a purity that is a product of inexperience, not naivety. She finds shame in her lowly situation, but it is simply the flipside of her ambition and work ethic. \u201cI have pride, Dylan. You know this word? Pride,\u201d she tells him heatedly. He is captivated \u2013 and later horrified \u2013 by her steeliness versus the soft nostalgia with which she recalls an idyllic Chinese childhood.     A young Lian and Dylan share a beer. Photograph: Lisa Tomasetti/Sydney Theatre Company    While this kind of cross-cultural exchange is nothing exceptional, from my own experience, the gap between local and foreigner does seem to be wider in China. Foreigners are perceived, at least initially, as draped with the colours of their national flag, and with varying degrees of frustration and humour the words \u201cyou don\u2019t understand\u201d inevitably show up regularly in conversation. It is a sentence uttered throughout the play. Of course, understanding that big, energetic, messy thing called China is a mammoth task. In her latest book, Linda Jaivin \u2013 one of many writers and academics that Smith consulted in writing her play \u2013 quotes a famous Taiwan writer called Li Ao: \u201cChina\u2019s a massive thing, still hidden in the mists. The Chinese don\u2019t understand China; all they know are \u2018Chinese cliches\u2019. Foreigners don\u2019t understand China; all they know is \u2018Chinese chop suey\u2019.\u201d Smith does much better than \u201cchop suey\u201d, despite having only been to China once, for a few weeks, more than 30 years ago. In her cosy Petersham home, the playwright credits her Chinese sister-in-law. Many of their long conversations fed into this work and it shows: the play is stuffed with contemporary Chinese references, from Weibo, to land dispossessions, \u201cleftover women\u201d and internet censorship.     Sue Smith, writer of Kryptonite. Photograph: Grant Sparkes-Carroll/Sydney Theatre Company    There is a spinning, joyful nausea about the play too, which required big risks on Smith\u2019s part. In explaining the challenges of capturing an alien culture, she says: \u201cI\u2019m actually trying to walk this fine line of how do we feel about each other? Can we ever really trust one another? Can we ever real understand each other? Of course there\u2019s going to be dangers in that territory. So, just bite the bullet and hope for the best really.\u201d The play is uneven in spots, as it attempts to juggle political intrigue, with a love story and rich historical details. But it is also a bold work that tackles a critical issue in contemporary Australia: our relationship with a foreign nation, and how we react to large cultural differences. In looking at Australia\u2019s foreign policy, Smith identifies the country\u2019s heavy-handed suspicion of non-democractic, non-western countries. \u201cClive Palmer\u2019s recent spray is a reminder of just how profound the distrust is under the surface in this country. The politicians, when they\u2019re sensible, say all the right things: \u2018we respect China and China\u2019s our best friend, blah blah blah\u2019. In reality the whole geopolitical sphere is nervous about the rise of China.  \u201cIs it [because] China is not a democracy or is it the old yellow peril fear? What is it?

You will have experienced a version of it yourself: you are at a football match or a gig and you need to find a friend. But the crowd means that the network is overloaded, and you can\u2019t get a signal on your phone. The thing that means you need to call someone is the very thing that means you can\u2019t. For Wong, the problem was more serious: he wasn\u2019t at a football match, but playing a leading role in the organisation of the pro-democracy protests that have shaken his city over the past week. And he wasn\u2019t just worried the network would be overloaded \u2013 he was worried the authorities would block it on purpose. Every major display of social unrest these days seems to come with a game-changing technological accompaniment. The London riots were narrated on BlackBerry Messenger. Twitter played an essential role in the Arab spring. Turkish protesters who found the internet blocked turned to censor-proof Virtual Private Networks. But none of those innovations was much use without a connection. For Wong and his allies in Hong Kong, the answer was an\u00a0app that allows people to send messages from phone to phone without mobile reception, or the internet: FireChat. When you download it, FireChat looks like an unexceptional venue for inane online chat about sport and TV. But it\u2019s more than that. If the network is down, FireChat can use Bluetooth \u2013 really just a sexed-up radio signal \u2013 to talk to nearby users. The protesters may find something satisfying in the way the system works, gaining strength like a movement, or a radical idea, not through a top-down imposition, but from thousands of little connections. Every new participant increases the network\u2019s range and strength. \u201cUsually, the more people there are in the same location, the less connectivity you get,\u201d says Micha Benoliel, one of the app\u2019s creators. \u201cBut with our system, it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d FireChat has already been used in protests in Taiwan, Iran and Iraq, but never on the scale being seen in Hong Kong. After Wong urged his movement to use it, FireChat got more than 100,000 new sign-ups in Hong Kong in under 24 hours; it has registered 800,000 chat sessions since. If the Communist party isn\u2019t quite reeling, its opponents\u2019 lives have at\u00a0least got a little easier. Of course, users would do well to take care: there is nothing to stop the authorities hopping on to the network as well. Benoliel recommends people avoid real names; this is, he says, for information-sharing, not for secrets. Still, in a sense, that is exactly the point. \u201cOur mission has always been freedom of speech, to help information to spread.

Hong Kong, one of the world\u2019s most important financial hubs, has exploded into protest. Since Sunday night, the so-called \u201cumbrella revolution\u201d has turned the city\u2019s gleaming central business district into a virtual conflict zone, replete with shouting mobs, police in riot gear, and clouds of tear gas. Tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents \u2013 young and old, rich and poor \u2013 have peacefully occupied major thoroughfares across the city, shuttering businesses and bringing traffic to a halt. They claim that Beijing reneged on an agreement to grant them open elections by 2017, and demand \u201ctrue universal suffrage\u201d. Organisers said on Monday that the protest would not end until Beijing changes its electoral guidelines and Leung Chun-Ying, the city\u2019s pro-Beijing chief executive, steps down. Neither side seems prepared to back off, and nobody knows how the standoff will end.       How this happened Hong Kong, a former British colony of 7 million people, has been governed under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework since it was handed back to Chinese control in 1997. The principle is simple in theory \u2014 Beijing is responsible for the city\u2019s defence and foreign affairs; Hong Kong enjoys limited self-governance and civil liberties, including an independent judiciary and unrestricted press. Its top political post \u2013 that of chief executive \u2013 is chosen by a \u201cnominating committee\u201d of 1,200 people, most of them from pro-Beijing elites. Yet when Beijing regained control over the city, it promised that the region would be able to elect its top leader by universal suffrage by 2017. The group guiding the current protests \u2013 set up 18 months ago by two professors and a baptist minister under the banner Occupy Central with Love and Peace \u2014 threatened to paralyse the city\u2019s central business district if Beijing broke its word.     A student protester rests next to a defaced cut-out of Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive Leung Chun-Ying. Photograph: Wong Maye-E/AP    Nobody knew when, or if, the protest would occur, but in August Beijing passed a reform framework to stipulate universal suffrage on its own terms \u2013 only two or three committee-vetted candidates who \u201clove the country\u201d would be allowed to run. Activists considered this the last straw. Students began a class boycott last Monday and, galvanised by a city-wide surge in support, staged a large-scale protest outside of the city government headquarters on Friday night. Occupy Central mobilised on Sunday. The rest is unfolding as you read. The issues Will Hong Kong get democracy? Probably not. Top Communist party officials have put their full weight behind the proposal for committee-vetted candidates, and have shown no sign that they\u2019ll be willing to heed protesters\u2019 demands. Above all, Beijing fears that the city, if left to its own devices, would choose a pro-democratic candidate, potentially planting the seeds for a movement to break away from mainland control. And for a leadership already grappling with separatist movements in the western regions Tibet and Xinjiang, any sort of successful independence movement would set an unthinkable precedent. Relations with Beijing The civil disobedience campaign is about more than open elections \u2013 it\u2019s about the future of the city\u2019s relationship with Beijing. Hong Kong residents say that over the past few years, the central government has been slowly and systematically tightening its grip over the city, leading them to feel politically marginalised and economically squeezed. Real estate markets have flooded with mainland money, making home ownership prohibitively expensive. Local media outlets have begun to rigorously self-censor, for fear of losing advertisers. Outspoken voices have been threatened, even attacked.     A woman picks up a yellow ribbon - a symbol of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement. Photograph: ALEX OGLE/AFP/Getty Images    Echoes of Tiananmen The main question burning in the minds of most Hong Kongers is how this will all end \u2013 and almost everyone involved can surmise a worst-case scenario. Hong Kong\u2019s former security chief Regina Ip said on Monday that the city government fears a \u201cmini-Tiananmen\u201d \u2013 presumably that the protests would be violently dispersed, perhaps by the Chinese military. Nobody wants to see a repeat of 4 June 1989, when Beijing dispatched the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) to open fire on peaceful pro-democracy protesters. The PLA maintains a garrison in Hong Kong, but Leung said in a televised address on Monday morning that the Hong Kong government would not call in the troops. Chinese state media has also emphasised the central government\u2019s confidence in Hong Kong authorities to deal with the protests themselves. That said, the protests continue to escalate, and Beijing seems ready to stand its ground, no matter what the cost. The view from the mainland While the blanket censorship makes it difficult to assess public sentiment towards the protest (state media has taken a hardline on the protests and censors blocked or scrubbed clean social media, mainland citizens have responded to past Hong Kong demonstrations with a mixture of puzzlement, envy and disdain. Similar protests on the mainland would be unthinkable \u2013 even organisers of seemingly benign demonstrations are subject to extreme intimidation, even prosecution. Mainstream Chinese society holds economic growth and social stability as sacrosanct, and many mainlanders wonder why a city which benefits tremendously from its mainland ties would turn on its most important benefactor.     A composite image shows eight Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters with covered faces. Photograph: ALEX HOFFORD/EPA    The future of \u2018One Country, Two Systems\u2019 At the end of last week, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, urged Taiwan to \u201creunite\u201d with mainland China under a Hong Kong-style \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework. His words left many analysts scratching their heads. Why invoke the system\u2019s virtues when its supposed beneficiaries are in the middle of an unprecedented revolt? Taiwan\u2019s democratic leadership rejected Xi\u2019s comments, saying that \u201cour government has no way of accepting them\u201d. This week\u2019s protests may be the most chaotic scenes Hong Kong has experienced since a violent, anti-British riot racked the city in 1967 \u2013 and many residents are taking it as evidence that the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework is fundamentally flawed, a recipe for political gridlock and social unrest. Regardless of the protest\u2019s outcome, Beijing has almost certainly already lost one of its most valuable assets in the southern city: the trust of its residents. How can I find out more?

As economists fret about a property bubble, mountains of shadow debt and slowing industrial output, China faces one certain crisis that will not go away. Beijing\u2019s failure to undertake political reform is leading to mounting disaffection on its peripheries \u2013 Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan, and now Hong Kong. At best this can be described as a failure of imagination. At worst, it is cynical and malign. But the reality is that China does not know how to go about meaningful political reform. Embracing greater inclusiveness would threaten one-party rule \u2013 or what is really a vast patronage system that Hong Kong\u2019s rich also benefit from. This is a charade that may well limp along unchallenged in China\u2019s increasingly prosperous heartland for some time. But it will be increasingly challenged by those who in no way benefit from the system. Beijing can buy political power in Hong Kong via the former British colony\u2019s moneyed elites \u2013 and to a certain extent it can try to do the same in Taiwan \u2013 but it has nothing to offer the ordinary citizens of Hong Kong other than a rigged popular vote. That is a bad deal. The people of Hong Kong know it, and now they have taken to the streets to dispute it. Sadly, they are dealing with a system that does not understand the words \u201cflexibility\u201d and \u201ccompromise\u201d. These are words that do not exist in Beijing\u2019s vocabulary of governance, because Beijing is convinced that even the smallest of compromises could lead to the kind of landslide public opposition to the party-patronage system that broke out in 1989. There are obvious parallels between the Tiananmen protests and the current demonstrations in Hong Kong. But the differences are also significant. Apart from the fact that angry Hong Kong citizens have far more access to information than the Beijing students who rose up in 1989, the people of Hong Kong have a far more specific goal. The Tiananmen protests were amorphous in nature. They were as much about opening China up to business with the outside world and allowing private entrepreneurship as they were about democracy, which under the circumstances can probably be best described as a far-fetched dream. In Hong Kong \u2013 anti-mainland sentiment aside \u2013 the protests are specifically in support of what young Hong Kong people see as their right to freely elect their leaders. This is the crux of the impasse. Beijing cannot budge on its position without sending a message of weakness to its own people \u2013 and setting what it would consider an unthinkable precedent. As for the Hong Kong government, it finds itself in the unenviable position of presiding over violent clashes between police and students as well as the Occupy movement, which has joined the swelling protests. If the clashes continue and become more violent, the government will find its tenuous legitimacy further undermined. Unfortunately, force is all the Hong Kong government has at its disposal, and if it comes to the point that People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) troops barracked in Hong Kong have to be used to disperse protesters, it would be a PR disaster for both Hong Kong and Beijing. It would undermine any remaining pretence that Beijing is sophisticated enough to rule over a region that prides itself on freedom of speech and rule of law. It could also be an intimation of things to come elsewhere in China. Countless voices \u2013 many of them now jailed or in exile \u2013 have spoken up on the need for political reform. Those voices have been crushed, their advice ignored, but the likelihood is that this is a mistake that Beijing will ultimately pay dearly for. In fact, it already is. Taiwan is watching events in Hong Kong closely, and the result will be greater popular distrust of Beijing, which will play into the hands of the island\u2019s independence movement. After two decades of economic reforms, Beijing has done nothing to prepare for the inevitable demands for political reform. Those demands are now here, on the streets of Hong Kong. Today, despite having 17 years since the 1997 handover to win over hearts and minds, to show the world that Beijing has what it takes to run a vibrant, open and prosperous society, China is losing Hong Kong."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/02/china-future-democracy-hong-kong", "publicationDate": "2014-10-02T18:57:10Z", "tags": ["Hong Kong", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["It was not of China\u2019s own initiative.Christopher CheungHong Kong \u2022 As a Taiwanese-American, I wanted to say thank you for your piece (Taiwan shows growing support for Hong Kong protests, theguardian.com, 30 September).", "My family members and I have attended recent protests in Taiwan and the US in support of democracy on both sides of the Taiwan strait.", "Thank you especially for discussing Taiwan\u2019s complicated history with\u00a0more\u00a0nuance and accuracy than the mainstream media usually offers."], "title": "China and the future of democracy in Hong Kong | @guardianletters", "article": "Hong Kong\u2019s current upheaval is even more \u201ccomplicated\u201d than Martin Jacques acknowledges (China is Hong Kong\u2019s future \u2013 not its enemy, 1 October). Jacques highlights colonial Britain\u2019s longstanding failure to introduce democracy. Fair enough. But democratisation was not, as he implies, the outcome of Beijing\u2019s farsighted benevolence. Commitments (albeit vague) to democratise were inserted into Sino-British agreements during the 1980s, largely in response to local civil society pressure, and that pressure has grown steadily ever since. Jacques argues that calls now for greater democracy are fuelled by resentment at an influx of wealthy mainlanders. There is some truth to this \u2013 but not enough to justify boiling down local grievances to envy spawned by a reversal in Hong Kong-mainland economic fortunes. Most Hongkongers are the children or grandchildren of refugees from Mao\u2019s China. Mistrust of Communists has for many always been central to their local consciousness \u2013 along with an attachment to distinctive local institutions. Among those prized institutions are an independent judiciary and a free press. Jacques tells us these are as safe as ever. However, Hong Kong\u2019s slide down the World Press Freedom Index (now level-pegging with Senegal at No 61) suggests otherwise. As for judicial independence, a Chinese government declaration this June that senior judges must be \u201cpatriotic\u201d was not reassuring. And the central government exerts far more influence over local politics than Jacques recognises in referring to Beijing\u2019s \u201chands-off approach\u201d. Hong Kong\u2019s post-1997 trajectory has\u00a0been more benign than many feared. But it does not follow that we should expect young Hongkongers today to fawn in gratitude and shut up about democracy. Jacques\u2019s Olympian disregard for their aspirations, and for the distinctive local identity and culture, is profoundly condescending and unwise.Edward VickersHong Kong permanent resident and former local schoolteacher \u2022 Martin Jacques attempts to defend China by arguing that, contrary to the west\u2019s impression that it is an authoritarian regime, China is in fact the champion of democracy and freedom in Hong Kong. Nothing can be further from the truth. For one thing, the present proposal for electoral reform approved by Beijing puts strict controls on who gets to stand in the election. It would let Beijing claim a false veneer of legitimacy for the future leader of Hong Kong. Resisting such a proposal is the core of the whole protest \u2013 a point obscured by Jacques. He thinks that because Hong Kong is governed under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle and the process of democratisation starts after the handover, China represents a force of democracy. What he overlooks is the historical involvement of Britain in pushing for such an arrangement in the first place, in the negotiations leading up to the Sino-British joint declaration in the 80s. Future democratisation was the condition laid down by the British for the handover of sovereignty to China. It was not of China\u2019s own initiative.Christopher CheungHong Kong \u2022 As a Taiwanese-American, I wanted to say thank you for your piece (Taiwan shows growing support for Hong Kong protests, theguardian.com, 30 September).

IDC\u2019s classification of 2-in-1s as \u201ctablets\u201d means that Asus doesn\u2019t figure in its top five manufacturers by shipment, putting Apple in fifth place for the first time in more than 20 years, with an estimated 4.98m computers shipped. But Gartner says Asus shipped 5.77m devices in the quarter \u2013 which suggests that if it shipped fewer desktops and laptops than Apple\u2019s 4.98m, it must have shipped at least 780,000 2-in-1 devices. \u201cAsus has been concentrating on that segment,\u201d said a Gartner spokesman. Dave Lindhout has charted the difference between Gartner\u2019s and IDC\u2019s measure of Asus\u2019s \u201cPC\u201d shipments, showing the growing gap between their measures \u2013 and so the rising number of 2-in-1 shipments from Asus.

While sales rose year-on-year in developed markets, which were the earliest to adopt PCs, they fell in emerging markets, where PC penetration is lower.  Corporate buyers are still replacing PCs following the end of Windows XP\u2019s support in April, providing an ongoing uplift for sales there: \u201cThe continued growth in the EMEA PC market reflects the end of official support for Windows XP and the need to replace older PCs,\u201d said Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner. Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, said: \u201cConsumers\u2019 attention is slowly going back to PC purchases as tablet adoption peaked with mainstream consumers. The transition from PCs to tablets has faded as tablet penetration has reached the 40-50% range.\u201d But the ongoing slow sales in emerging markets showed that consumers there who could afford PCs were in effect satisfied \u2013 and that those without PCs would choose cheap tablets instead. \u201cThis is a one of the major reasons for the slow growth in PC shipments in the emerging market,\u201d said Kitagawa. For smaller PC players, the major concern is that the shrinking number of PC sales means that larger players are grabbing more share \u2013 especially as businesses now purchase the majority of PCs and seek trusted sources. The sum of the top five vendors\u2019 shipments was two-third of the market \u2013 and more than 70% including Apple \u2013 and all grew more than the industry average. That will mean further withdrawals from the market, analysts say. This year Sony sold off its PC business to a private equity company, Toshiba announced it will withdraw from selling to consumers, and Samsung pulled out of selling both Windows PCs and Chromebooks in Europe.  Vizio, best known in the TV market, said in July that it was \u201crethinking\u201d its attempt to break into the PC market; its \u201ccomputing\u201d page on its website is now dead. Loren Loverde, of IDC\u2019s worldwide PC tracker group, said that more would follow: \u201cIn addition to pressures like slower growth, lower prices and margins, and competition from other devices, the shift to portable PCs and the expansion in emerging markets (not just total PC volume, but more channels, growth in smaller cities and lower income segments) also leaves less room for smaller players. Loverde added: \u201cThere are some other Asian/emerging market players such as Tongfang, Positivo, Haier, LG Electronics, MSI, and Panasonic. Within desktops, vendors outside the top 10 still account for almost 40% of the market \u2013 sold through lots of smaller local vendors, value-added resellers, and assemblers. For portables that number is now less than 10%.\u201d However desktops make up only about 40% of worldwide shipments, meaning that many small players are competing for business \u2013 which also drives down margins and sustainability. Apple\u2019s surprise appearance Apple\u2019s appearance in IDC\u2019s list of the top five PC makers is not that surprising, said Loren Loverde, of IDC\u2019s worldwide PC trackers division. While IDC and Gartner both name only the top five companies, \u201cthe difference between fifth and sixth is not always large\u2013 as in this case,\u201d Loverde said.  \u201cPC shipments for the two vendors were also fairly close a year ago \u2013 but Apple has been growing faster, so the rank change is not so surprising from a growth perspective.\u201d Apple also cut prices and benefited from generally higher sales growth in the US, Loverde said. \u201cAsus was harder hit [in PC shipments] by its shift to alternate devices like tablets, including 2-in-1s and smartphones, and has essentially stabilised its PC business over the past year. Our results for the just-past quarter show Asus growing again, but still falling behind Apple.\u201d Both IDC and Gartner say that Apple was the third-largest PC vendor in the US during the quarter, shipping almost half its worldwide total there and so benefiting from a slight uplift in sales. Motherboards: no salvation Sales of motherboards \u2013 used either to build PCs or repair existing ones \u2013 have not escaped the squeeze on the PC market.  The market is dominated by Asus and Gigabyte of Taiwan, which mainly produce them for companies assembling them commercially, but also sell some to hobbyists and professionals.  According to Sandler Research, the market is roughly steady at about 38m units each quarter, but Asus and Gigabyte are taking a growing share of that as prices are forced down. About 40% of Gigabytes exports go to Asia, particularly China, and 40% to Europe, with the remainder going to the US. \u2022 Breaking HP up isn\u2019t hard to do \u2013 but PC and printing arms will be left behind"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/oct/13/new-species-snail-same-sex-marriage-gay-aegista-diversifamilia", "publicationDate": "2014-10-13T13:07:10Z", "tags": ["Zoology", "Biology", "Science", "Taxonomy", "World news", "Wildlife", "Animals", "Environment"], "sentences": ["Researchers in Taiwan have taken the unusual step of naming a newly identified species of snail in recognition of same-sex marriage rights.", "Dr Lee explained that the team\u2019s research coincided with major struggles for same-sex marriage rights in Taiwan and worldwide, which the scientists decided to recognise through the naming of their snail.", "Since it was first proposed last October, the Taiwanese legislature has shelved a landmark bill to legalise same-sex marriage, leading to protests outside the parliament gates last week.", "The snail, a land species endemic to Taiwan, was previously thought to be a member of the common species Aegista subchinensis.", "The only other requirement to have your name accepted is to submit examples of the species to a museum or similar institution so that they can be made available to other researchers, and six such specimens have already made the long journey from Taiwan to the Natural History Museum in London."], "title": "New species of snail named in celebration of same-sex marriage", "article": "Researchers in Taiwan have taken the unusual step of naming a newly identified species of snail in recognition of same-sex marriage rights.

This seems an extraordinary admission from two editors of the Economist, the flag-bearer of English liberalism, which has long insisted that the non-west could only achieve prosperity and stability through western prescriptions. It almost obscures the fact that the 20th century was blighted by the same pathologies that today make the western model seem unworkable, and render its fervent advocates a bit lost. The most violent century in human history, it was hardly the best advertisement for the \u201cbland fanatics of western civilisation\u201d, as the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr called them at the height of the cold war, \u201cwho regard the highly contingent achievements of our culture as the final form and norm of human existence\u201d.  Niebuhr was critiquing a fundamentalist creed that has coloured our view of the world for more than a century: that western institutions of the nation-state and liberal democracy will be gradually generalised around the world, and that the aspiring middle classes created by industrial capitalism will bring about accountable, representative and stable governments \u2013 that every society, in short, is destined to evolve just as the west did. Critics of this teleological view, which defines \u201cprogress\u201d exclusively as development along western lines, have long perceived its absolutist nature. Secular liberalism, the Russian thinker Alexander Herzen cautioned as early as 1862, \u201cis the final religion, though its church is not of the other world but of this\u201d. But it has had many presumptive popes and encyclicals: from the 19th-century dream of a westernised world long championed by the Economist, in which capital, goods, jobs and people freely circulate, to Henry Luce\u2019s proclamation of an \u201cAmerican century\u201d of free trade, and \u201cmodernisation theory\u201d \u2013 the attempt by American cold warriors to seduce the postcolonial world away from communist-style revolution and into the gradualist alternative of consumer capitalism and democracy. The collapse of communist regimes in 1989 further emboldened Niebuhr\u2019s bland fanatics. The old Marxist teleology was retrofitted rather than discarded in Francis Fukuyama\u2019s influential end-of-history thesis, and cruder theories about the inevitable march to worldwide prosperity and stability were vended by such Panglosses of globalisation as Thomas Friedman. Arguing that people privileged enough to consume McDonald\u2019s burgers don\u2019t go to war with each other, the New York Times columnist was not alone in mixing old-fangled Eurocentrism with American can-doism, a doctrine that grew from America\u2019s uninterrupted good fortune and unchallenged power in the century before September 2001. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 briefly disrupted celebrations of a world globalised by capital and consumption. But the shock to naive minds only further entrenched in them the intellectual habits of the cold war \u2013 thinking through binary oppositions of \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cunfree\u201d worlds \u2013 and redoubled an old delusion: liberal democracy, conceived by modernisation theorists as the inevitable preference of the beneficiaries of capitalism, could now be implanted by force in recalcitrant societies. Invocations of a new \u201clong struggle\u201d against \u201cIslamofascism\u201d aroused many superannuated cold warriors who missed the ideological certainties of battling communism. Intellectual narcissism survived, and was often deepened by, the realisation that economic power had begun to shift from the west. The Chinese, who had \u201cgot capitalism\u201d, were, after all, now \u201cdownloading western apps\u201d, according to Niall Ferguson. As late as 2008, Fareed Zakaria declared in his much-cited book, The Post-American World, that \u201cthe rise of the rest is a consequence of American ideas and actions\u201d and that \u201cthe world is going America\u2019s way\u201d, with countries \u201cbecoming more open, market-friendly and democratic\u201d. A world in flames One event after another in recent months has cruelly exposed such facile narratives. China, though market-friendly, looks further from democracy than before. The experiment with free-market capitalism in Russia has entrenched a kleptocratic regime with a messianic belief in Russian supremacism. Authoritarian leaders, anti-democratic backlashes and rightwing extremism define the politics of even such ostensibly democratic countries as India, Israel, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Turkey. The atrocities of this summer in particular have plunged political and media elites in the west into stunned bewilderment and some truly desperate cliches. The extraordinary hegemonic power of their ideas had helped them escape radical examination when the world could still be presented as going America\u2019s way. But their preferred image of the west \u2013 the idealised one in which they sought to remake the rest of the world \u2013 has been consistently challenged by many critics, left or right, in the west as well as the east. Herzen was already warning in the 19th century that \u201cour classic ignorance of the western European will be productive of a great deal of harm; racial hatred and bloody collisions will develop from it.\u201d Herzen was sceptical of those liberal \u201cwesternisers\u201d who believed that Russia could progress only by diligently emulating western institutions and ideologies. Intimate experience and knowledge of Europe during his long exile there had convinced him that European dominance, arrived at after much fratricidal violence and underpinned by much intellectual deception and self-deception, did not amount to \u201cprogress\u201d. Herzen, a believer in cultural pluralism, asked a question that rarely occurs to today\u2019s westernisers: \u201cWhy should a nation that has developed in its own way, under completely different conditions from those of the west European states, with different elements in its life, live through the European past, and that, too, when it knows perfectly well what that past leads to?\u201d     An empty billboard site in S\u00e3o Paolo, Brazil. Billboard advertising has been banned there since 2007.  Photograph: Tony de Marco    The brutality that Herzen saw as underpinning Europe\u2019s progress turned out, in the next century, to be a mere prelude to the biggest bloodbath in history: two world wars, and ferocious ethnic cleansing that claimed tens of millions of victims. The imperative to emulate Europe\u2019s progress was nevertheless embraced by the ruling elites of dozens of new nation-states that emerged from the ruins of European empires in the mid-20th century, and embarked on a fantastic quest for western-style wealth and power. Today, racial hatred and bloody collisions ravage the world where liberal democracy and capitalism were expected to jointly reign. This moment demands a fresh interrogation of what Neibuhr euphemistically called \u201cthe highly contingent achievements of the west\u201d, and closer attention to the varied histories of the non-west. Instead, the most common response to the present crisis has been despair over western \u201cweakness\u201d \u2013 and much acrimony over what Barack Obama, president of the \u201csole superpower\u201d and the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d should have done to fix it. \u201cWill the West Win?\u201d Prospect asks on the cover of its latest issue, underlining the forlornness of the question with a picture of Henry Kissinger, whose complicity in various murderous fiascos from Vietnam to Iraq has not prevented his re-incarnation among the perplexed as a sage of hardheaded realism. Robert Kagan, writing in the Wall Street Journal at the start of September, articulated a defiant neoconservative faith that America is condemned to use \u201chard power\u201d against the enemies of liberal modernity who understand no other language, such as Japan and Germany in the early 20th century, and Putin\u2019s Russia today. Kagan doesn\u2019t say which manifestation of hard power \u2013 firebombing Germany, nuking Japan, napalming Vietnam \u2013 the United States should aim against Russia, or if the shock-and-awe campaign that he cheerled in Iraq is a better template. Roger Cohen of the New York Times provides a milder variation on the clash of civilisations discourse when he laments that \u201cEuropean nations with populations from former colonies often seem unable to celebrate their values of freedom, democracy and the rule of law\u201d.  Such diehard believers in the west\u2019s capacity to shape global events and congratulate itself eternally were afflicted with an obsolete assumption even in 1989: that the 20th century was defined by the battles between liberal democracy and totalitarian ideologies, such as fascism and communism. Their obsession with a largely intra-western dispute obscured the fact that the most significant event of the 20th century was decolonisation, and the emergence of new nation-states across Asia and Africa. They barely registered the fact that liberal democracies were experienced as ruthlessly imperialist by their colonial subjects. For people luxuriating at a high level of abstraction, and accustomed to dealing during the cold war with nation-states organised simply into blocs and superblocs, it was always too inconvenient to examine whether the freshly imagined communities of Asia and Africa were innately strong and cohesive enough to withhold the strains and divisions of state-building and economic growth. If they had indeed risked engaging with complexity and contradiction, they would have found that the urge to be a wealthy and powerful nation-state along western lines initially ordered and then disordered first Russia, Germany and Japan, and then, in our own time, plunged a vast swath of the postcolonial world into bloody conflict. History\u2019s long-term losers The temptation to imitate the evidently triumphant western model, as Herzen feared, was always greater than the urge to reject it. For many in the old and sophisticated societies of Asia and Africa, chafing under the domination of western Europe\u2019s very small countries, it seemed clear that human beings could muster up an unprecedented collective power through new European forms of organisation like the nation-state and the industrialised economy. Much of Europe had first learned this harsh lesson in political and military innovation from Napoleon\u2019s all-conquering army. In the century after the Napoleonic wars, European societies gradually learned how to deploy effectively a modern military, technology, railways, roads, judicial and educational systems and create a feeling of belonging and solidarity, most often by identifying dangerous enemies within and without. As Eugen Weber showed in his classic book Peasants into Frenchmen (1976), this was a uniformly brutal process in France itself. Much of Europe then went on to suffer widespread dispossession, the destruction of regional languages and cultures, and the institutionalisation of hoary prejudices like antisemitism. The 19th century\u2019s most sensitive minds, from Kierkegaard to Ruskin, recoiled from such modernisation, though they did not always know the darker side of it: rapacious European colonialism in Asia and Africa. By the 1940s, competitive nationalisms in Europe stood implicated in the most vicious wars and crimes against religious and ethnic minorities witnessed in human history. After the second world war, European countries \u2013 under American auspices and the pressures of the cold war \u2013 were forced to imagine less antagonistic political and economic relations, which eventually resulted in the European Union.     A lorry with no logo in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Photograph: Tony de Marco    But the new nation-states in Asia and Africa had already started on their own fraught journey to modernity, riding roughshod over ethnic and religious diversity and older ways of life. Asians and Africans educated in western-style institutions despaired of their traditionalist elites as much as they resented European dominance over their societies. They sought true power and sovereignty in a world of powerful nation-states \u2013 what alone seemed to guarantee them and their peoples a fair chance at strength, equality and dignity in the white man\u2019s world. In this quest China\u2019s Mao Zedong and Turkey\u2019s Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk as much as Iran\u2019s democratically-elected prime minister Mohammed Mossadegh followed the western model of mass-mobilisation and state-building. By then European and American dominance over \u201cthe world\u2019s economies and peoples\u201d had, as the Cambridge historian Christopher Bayly writes in The Birth of the Modern World, turned a large part of humanity \u201cinto long-term losers in the scramble for resources and dignity\u201d. Nevertheless, the explicitly defined aim of Asia and Africa\u2019s first nationalist icons, who tended to be socialist and secular (Atat\u00fcrk, Nehru, Nasser, Nkrumah, Mao, and Sukarno), was \u201ccatch-up\u201d with the west. Recent ruling classes of the non-west have looked to McKinsey rather than Marx to help define their socioeconomic future; but they have not dared to alter the founding basis of their legitimacy as \u201cmodernisers\u201d leading their countries to convergence with the west and attainment of European and American living standards. As it turns out, the latecomers to modernity, dumping protectionist socialism for global capitalism, have got their timing wrong again. In the 21st century that old spell of universal progress through western ideologies \u2013 socialism and capitalism \u2013 has been decisively broken. If we are appalled and dumbfounded by a world in flames it is because we have been living \u2013 in the east and south as well as west and north \u2013 with vanities and illusions: that Asian and African societies would become, like Europe, more secular and instrumentally rational as economic growth accelerated; that with socialism dead and buried, free markets would guarantee rapid economic growth and worldwide prosperity. What these fantasies of inverted Hegelianism always disguised was a sobering fact: that the dynamics and specific features of western \u201cprogress\u201d were not and could not be replicated or correctly sequenced in the non-west. The enabling conditions of Europe\u2019s 19th-century success \u2013 small, relatively homogenous populations, or the ability to send surplus populations abroad as soldiers, merchants and missionaries \u2013 were missing in the large and populous countries of Asia and Africa. Furthermore, imperialism had deprived them, as Basil Davidson argued in The Black Man\u2019s Burden: Africa and the Curse of the Nation-State, of the resources to pursue western-style economic development; it had also imposed ruinous ideologies and institutions upon societies that had developed, over centuries, their own viable political units and social structures. Recklessly exported worldwide even today, the west\u2019s successful formulas have continued to cause much invisible suffering. What may have been the right fit for 19th-century colonialists in countries with endless resources cannot secure a stable future for India, China, and other late arrivals to the modern world, which can only colonise their own territories and uproot their own indigenous peoples in the search for valuable commodities and resources.     S\u00e3o Paulo. Photograph: Tony de Marco    The result is endless insurgencies and counter-insurgencies, wars and massacres, the rise of such bizarre anachronisms and novelties as Maoist guerrillas in India and self-immolating monks in Tibet, the increased attraction of unemployed and unemployable youth to extremist organisations, and the endless misery that provokes thousands of desperate Asians and Africans to make the risky journey to what they see as the centre of successful modernity. It should be no surprise that religion in the non-western world has failed to disappear under the juggernaut of industrial capitalism, or that liberal democracy finds its most dedicated saboteurs among the new middle classes. The political and economic institutions and ideologies of western Europe and the United States had been forged by specific events \u2013 revolts against clerical authority, industrial innovations, capitalist consolidation through colonial conquest \u2013 that did not occur elsewhere. So formal religion \u2013 not only Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, and the Russian Orthodox Church, but also such quietist religions as Buddhism \u2013 is actually now increasingly allied with rather than detached from state power. The middle classes, whether in India, Thailand, Turkey or Egypt, betray a greater liking for authoritarian leaders and even uniformed despots than for the rule of law and social justice.    The atrocities of this summer have plunged political and media elites in the west into stunned bewilderment       But then western ideologues during the cold war absurdly prettified the rise of the \u201cdemocratic\u201d west. The long struggle against communism, which claimed superior moral virtue, required many expedient feints. And so the centuries of civil war, imperial conquest, brutal exploitation, and genocide were suppressed in accounts that showed how westerners made the modern world, and became with their liberal democracies the superior people everyone else ought to catch up with. \u201cAll of the western nations,\u201d James Baldwin warned during the cold war in 1963, are \u201ccaught in a lie, the lie of their pretended humanism; this means that their history has no moral justification, and the west has no moral authority.\u201d The deception that an African-American easily divined has continued, nevertheless, to enjoy political support and intellectual respectability long after the end of the cold war. Thus the editors of the Economist elide in The Fourth Revolution the history of mass slaughter in the west itself that led to the modern nation-state: the religious wars of the 17th century, the terror of French revolutions, the Napoleonic wars, the Franco-Prussian war and the wars of Italian unification, among others. Mainstream Anglo-American writers who vend popular explanations of how the west made the modern world veer between intellectual equivocation and insouciance about the west\u2019s comparative advantage of colonialism, slavery and indentured labour. \u201cWe cannot pretend,\u201d Ferguson avers, that the \u201cmobilisation of cheap and probably underemployed Asian labour to grow rubber and dig gold had no economic value.\u201d A recent review in the Economist of a history explaining the compact between capitalism and slavery protests that \u201calmost all the blacks\u201d in the book are \u201cvictims\u201d, and \u201calmost all the whites villains\u201d. Understandably, history has to be \u201cbalanced\u201d for Davos Men, who cannot bear too much reality in their effervescent prognoses of \u201cconvergence\u201d between the west and the rest. But obscuring the monstrous costs of the west\u2019s own \u201cprogress\u201d destroys any possibility of explaining the proliferation of large-scale violence in the world today, let along finding a way to contain it. Evasions, suppressions and downright falsehoods have resulted, over time, in a massive store of defective knowledge \u2013 an ignorance that Herzen correctly feared to be pernicious \u2013 about the west and the non-west alike. Simple-minded and misleading ideas and assumptions, drawn from this blinkered history, today shape the speeches of western statesmen, thinktank reports and newspaper editorials, while supplying fuel to countless log-rolling columnists, TV pundits and terrorism experts. The price of progress A faith in the west\u2019s superiority has not always been an obstacle to understanding the tormented process of modernisation in the rest of the world, as the French anti-communist Raymond Aron demonstrated in books like Progress and Disillusion (1968) and The Opium of the Intellectuals (1955). Aron believed the west made the modern world with its political and economic innovations and material goals, but did not flinch from examining what this fact really augured about the modern world. As he saw it, the conflicts and contradictions thrown up by the pursuit of modernity had been hard enough to manage for western societies for much of the last century. Industrial societies alone had seemed able to improve material conditions, and bring about a measure of social and economic equality; but the promise of equality, which staved off social unrest, was increasingly difficult to fulfill because specialisation kept producing fresh hierarchies. Some parts of the west had achieved some reduction in material inequalities, due to a market economy which produced both desirable goods and the means to acquire them; organised labour, which made it possible for workers to demand higher wages; and political liberty, which made the rulers accountable to the ruled. And some western countries had also, however brutally, got the sequencing broadly right: they had managed to build resilient states before trying to turn peasants into citizens. (\u201cWe have made Italy; now we must make the Italians,\u201d the Italian nationalist Massimo d\u2019Azeglio famously proclaimed in 1860.) The most successful European states had also accomplished a measure of economic growth before gradually extending democratic rights to a majority of the population. \u201cNo European country,\u201d Aron pointed out, \u201cever went through the phase of economic development which India and China are now experiencing, under a regime that was representative and democratic.\u201d Nowhere in Europe, he wrote in The Opium of Intellectuals, \u201cduring the long years when industrial populations were growing rapidly, factory chimneys looming up over the suburbs and railways and bridges being constructed, were personal liberties, universal suffrage and the parliamentary system combined\u201d.     S\u00e3o Paulo Photograph: Tony de Marco    Countries outside the west, however, faced simultaneously the arduous tasks of establishing strong nation-states and viable economies, and satisfying the demands for dignity and equality of freshly politicised peoples. This made the importation of western measures and techniques of success in places that \u201chave not yet emerged from feudal poverty\u201d an unprecedented and perilous experiment. Travelling through Asia and Africa in the 1950s, Aron discerned the potential for authoritarianism as well as dark chaos. There were not many political choices before societies that had lost their old traditional sources of authority while embarking on the adventure of building new nation-states and industrial economies in a secular and materialist ethos. These rationalised societies, constituted by \u201cindividuals and their desires\u201d, had to either build a social and political consensus themselves or have it imposed on them by a strongman. Failure would plunge them into violent anarchy. Aron was no vulgar can-doist. American individualism, the product of a short history of unrepeatable national success, in his view, \u201cspreads unlimited optimism, denigrates the past, and encourages the adoption of institutions which are in themselves destructive of the collective unity\u201d. Nor was he a partisan of the blood-splattered French revolutionary tradition, which requires \u201cpeople to submit to the strictest discipline in the name of the ultimate freedom\u201d \u2013 whose latest incarnation is Isis and its attempt to construct an utopian \u201cIslamic State\u201d through a reign of terror. The state under siege Applied to the many nation-states that emerged in the mid-20th century, Aron\u2019s sombre analysis can only embarrass those who have been daydreaming since 1989 about a worldwide upsurge of liberal democracy in tandem with capitalism. Indeed, long before the rise of European totalitarianisms, urgent state-building and the search for rapid and high economic growth had doomed individual liberties to a precarious existence in Japan. Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia and South Korea went on to show, after 1945, that a flourishing capitalist economy always was compatible with the denial of democratic rights. China has more recently achieved a form of capitalist modernity without embracing liberal democracy. Turkey now enjoys economic growth as well as regular elections; but these have not made the country break with long decades of authoritarian rule. The arrival of Anatolian masses in politics has actually enabled a demagogue like Erdo\u011fan to imagine himself as a second Atat\u00fcrk. Turkey, however, may have been relatively fortunate in being able to build a modern state out of the ruins of the Ottoman empire. Disorder was the fate of many new nations that had been insufficiently or too fervidly imagined, such as Myanmar and Pakistan; their weak state structures and fragmented civil society have condemned them to oscillate perennially between civilian and military despots while warding off challenges from disaffected minorities and religious fanatics. Until the Arab spring, ruthless despots kept a lid on sectarian animosities in the nation-states carved out of the Ottoman empire. Today, as the shattering of Iraq, Libya and Syria reveals, despotism, far from being a bulwark against militant disaffection, is an effective furnace for it. Countries that managed to rebuild commanding state structures after popular nationalist revolutions \u2013 such as China, Vietnam, and Iran \u2013 look stable and cohesive when compared with a traditional monarchy such as Thailand or wholly artificial nation-states like Iraq and Syria. The bloody regimes inaugurated by Khomeini and Mao survived some terrible internal and external conflicts \u2013 the Korean and Iran-Iraq wars, the Cultural Revolution and much fratricidal bloodletting \u2013 partly because their core nationalist ideologies secured consent from many of their subjects. Since 1989, however, this strenuously achieved national consensus in many countries has been under siege from a fresh quarter: an ideology of endless economic expansion and private wealth-creation that had been tamed in the mid-20th century. After its most severe global crisis in the 1930s, capitalism had suffered a decline in legitimacy, and in much of the non-western world, planned and protected economic growth had become the chosen means to such ends as social justice and gender equality. In our own age, feral forms of capitalism, which after the Depression were defanged by social-welfarism in the west and protectionist economies elsewhere, have turned into an elemental force. Thus, nation-states already struggling against secessionist movements by ethnic and religious minorities have seen their internal unity further undermined by capitalism\u2019s dominant ethic of primitive accumulation and individual gratification.    All of the western nations are caught in the lie of their pretended humanism; this means the west has no moral authority       China, once the world\u2019s most egalitarian society, is now even more unequal than the United States \u2013 1% of its population owns one-third of the national wealth \u2013 and prone to defuse its increasing social contradictions through a hardline nationalism directed at its neighbours, particularly Japan. Many formally democratic nation-states, such as India, Indonesia, and South Africa, have struggled to maintain their national consensus in the face of the imperative to privatise basic services such as water, health and education (and also, for many countries, to de-industrialise, and surrender their sovereignty to markets). Mobile and transnational capital, which de-territorialises wealth and poverty, has made state-building and its original goals of broad social and economic uplift nearly impossible to achieve within national boundaries. The elites primarily benefitting from global capitalism have had to devise new ideologies to make their dominance seem natural. Thus, India and Israel, which started out as nation-states committed to social justice, have seen their foundational ideals radically reconfigured by a nexus of neoliberal politicians and majoritarian nationalists, who now try to bludgeon their disaffected subjects into loyalty to a \u201cJewish state\u201d and a \u201cHindu nation\u201d. Demagogues in Thailand, Myanmar, and Pakistan have emerged at the head of populations angry and fearful about being deprived of the endlessly postponed fruits of modernity. Identified with elite or sectarian interests, the unrepresentative central state in many countries struggles to compete with offers of stability and order from non-state actors. Not surprisingly, even the vicious Isis claims to offer better governance to Sunnis angry with the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad. So do Maoist insurgents who control large territories in Central India, and even drug-traffickers in Myanmar and Mexico. A shattered mirror Fukuyama, asserting that the \u201cpower of the democratic ideal\u201d remains immense, claimed earlier this year that \u201cwe should have no doubt as to what kind of society lies at the end of History\u201d. But the time for grand Hegelian theories about the rational spirit of history incarnated in the nation-state, socialism, capitalism, or liberal democracy is now over. Looking at our own complex disorder we can no longer accept that it manifests an a priori moral and rational order, visible only to an elite thus far, that will ultimately be revealed to all. How then do we interpret it? Reflecting on the world\u2019s \u201cpervasive raggedness\u201d in the last essay he wrote before his death in 2006, the American anthropologist Clifford Geertz spoke of how \u201cthe shattering of larger coherences \u2026 has made relating local realities with overarching ones \u2026 extremely difficult.\u201d \u201cIf the general is to be grasped at all,\u201d Geertz wrote, \u201cand new unities uncovered, it must, it seems, be grasped not directly, all at once, but via instances, differences, variations, particulars \u2013 piecemeal, case by case. In a splintered world, we must address the splinters.\u201d     S\u00e3o Paulo Photograph: Tony de Marco    Such an approach would necessarily demand greater attention to historical specificity and detail, the presence of contingency, and the ever-deepening contradictions of nation-states amid the crises of capitalism. It would require asking why nation-building in Afghanistan and Iraq failed catastrophically while decentralisation helped stabilise Indonesia, the world\u2019s largest Muslim country, after a long spell of despotic rule supported by the middle class. It would require an admission that Iraq can achieve a modicum of stability not by reviving the doomed project of nation-state but through a return to Ottoman-style confederal institutions that devolve power and guarantee minority rights. Addressing the splinters leaves no scope for vacuous moralising against \u201cIslamic extremism\u201d: in their puritanical and utopian zeal, the Islamic revolutionaries brutally advancing across Syria and Iraq resemble the fanatically secular Khmer Rouge more than anything in the long history of Islam. A fresh grasp of the general also necessitates understanding the precise ways in which western ideologues, and their non-western epigones, continue to \u201cmake\u201d the modern world. \u201cShock-therapy\u201d administered to a hapless Russian population in the 1990s and the horrific suffering afterwards set the stage for Putin\u2019s messianic Eurasianism. But, following Geertz\u2019s insistence on differences and variations, the ressentiment of the west articulated by nationalists in Russia, China, and India cannot be conflated with the resistance to a predatory form of modernisation \u2013 ruthless dispossession by a profit-driven nexus of the state and business \u2013 mounted by indigenous peoples in Tibet, India, Peru and Bolivia. In any case, the doubters of western-style progress today include more than just marginal communities and some angry environmental activists. Last month the Economist said that, on the basis of IMF data, emerging economies \u2013 or the \u201clarge part of humanity\u201d that Bayly called the \u201clong-term losers\u201d of history \u2013 might have to wait for three centuries in order to catch up with the west. In the Economist\u2019s assessment, which pitilessly annuls the upbeat projections beloved of consultants and investors, the last decade of rapid growth was an \u201caberration\u201d and \u201cbillions of people will be poorer for a lot longer than they might have expected just a few years ago\u201d. The implications are sobering: the non-west not only finds itself replicating the west\u2019s violence and trauma on an infinitely larger scale. While helping inflict the profoundest damage yet on the environment \u2013 manifest today in rising sea levels, erratic rainfall, drought, declining harvests, and devastating floods \u2013 the non-west also has no real prospect of catching up with the west. How do we chart our way out of this impasse? His own discovery of the tragically insuperable contradictions of westernisation led Aron into the odd company of the many thinkers in the east and the west who questioned the exalting of economic growth as an end in itself. Of course, other ways of conceiving of the good life have existed long before a crudely utilitarian calculus \u2013 which institutionalises greed, credits slavery with economic value and confuses individual freedom with consumer choice \u2013 replaced thinking in our most prominent minds. Such re-examinations of liberal capitalist ideas of \u201cdevelopment\u201d, and exploration of suppressed intellectual traditions, are not nearly as rousing or self-flattering as the rhetorical binaries that make laptop bombers pound the keyboard with the caps lock glowing green. Barack Obama, who struggled to adhere to a wise policy of not doing stupid stuff, has launched another open-ended war after he was assailed for being weak by assorted can-doists. Plainly, Anglo-American elites who are handsomely compensated to live forever in the early 20th century, when the liberal-democratic west crushed its most vicious enemies, will never cease to find more brutes to exterminate. The rest of us, however, have to live in the 21st century, and prevent it from turning into yet another rotten one for the western model. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 October 2014. An earlier version stated that \u201cNo less than the World Bank admitted last month that emerging economies \u2026 might have to wait for three centuries in order to catch up with the west\u201d.

According to a new report from the International Publishers Association (IPA), UK publishers released 184,000 new and revised titles in 2013. This equates to 2,875 titles per million inhabitants, and places the UK an astonishing 1,000-plus titles ahead of second-placed Taiwan and Slovenia (1,831). Australia is considerably lower, at 1,176, while the US published just 959 titles per million inhabitants. The data was compiled from a mix of figures provided by national publishers\u2019 associations, national libraries and national ISBN agencies, and excludes self-published titles, said the IPA. The organisation considered 40 countries for its report \u2013 those for which it could obtain \u201ca reasonably reliable value for either the total book market or for publishers\u2019 net revenues\u201d. The UK figure is drawn from sales monitor Nielsen Book, which recorded the total number of new and revised titles published in the UK as about 184,000 in 2013, of which 60,000 were digital. Leading literary agent Jonny Geller at Curtis Brown described the figure as \u201ceither a sign of cultural vitality or publishing suicide\u201d. \u201cOf course, it is utter madness to publish so many books when the average person reads between one and five books a year, but would you prefer 184,000 new brands of shoes or pointless luxury items? In fact, don\u2019t answer that,\u201d said Geller. At independent publisher Canongate, Jamie Byng was also concerned by the statistic. \u201cI think we publish too many books, Canongate included, and I think this impacts negatively on how well we publish books as an industry. It is very easy to acquire a book. Much harder to publish it successfully. Less is so often much much more,\u201d said Byng. But Roland Philipps, the managing director of John Murray, was positive about the figures. \u201cFor the vibrancy of culture, books are essential, and if publishers are taking on more they must believe that voices are deserving to be heard, even if not all those voices make an impact with the consumer,\u201d said Philipps. Jenn Ashworth, who won a Betty Trask award for her debut novel A Kind of Intimacy, agreed. \u201cMore books and more people talking about books is always excellent,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe us British people should listen a little more than we talk and read more fiction in translation, and it is a shame we have fewer and fewer librarians to help readers navigate their way through all this glorious literary chaos and find hidden gems. But you\u2019re never going to get me to say that people reading and writing and publishing is a bad thing.\u201d In absolute terms, the UK is the third leading publisher in the world and the highest in Europe, according to the IPA, with its 184,000 titles coming in behind China\u2019s 444,000 \u2013 which equates to 325 per million inhabitants \u2013 and the US\u2019s 304,912. (In tiny Iceland, which was not included, around 1,000 new titles are published each year in a language spoken by only 320,000 people.) The UK\u2019s Publishers Association pointed out that the report reveals the UK \u201calso enjoys the world\u2019s best global export performance, with export revenues in 2013 exceeding \u20ac1.5bn, compared with \u20ac1bn for the US and \u20ac331m for Spain\u201d. Richard Mollet, chief executive of the Publishers Association, described it as a \u201cworld-leading performance\u201d, adding that \u201cas well as the advantage of the English language, British creativity, innovation and historic strength in publishing all play their part\u201d.  \u201cBritish publishing is a central part of the success story of our creative industries and this performance shows that the UK\u2019s legal and commercial environment \u2013 notably our copyright laws \u2013 continue to be the underpinning to strong economic performance,\u201d said Mollet. Geller agreed: \u201cWith \u20ac1.5bn in export revenue, I\u2019d like to think it is time to take the publishing industry more seriously as an industry and support its fight against copyright erosion and VAT threats.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/23/china-cyber-attacks-taiwan-windows-microsoft", "publicationDate": "2014-10-23T08:14:49Z", "tags": ["Hacking", "Malware", "Viruses", "Microsoft", "Data and computer security", "Cybercrime", "Computing", "Internet", "China", "Taiwan", "Technology"], "sentences": ["The vulnerability is seemingly now being used in attacks on Taiwanese targets, exploited by hackers creating malicious PowerPoint documents that launched exploit code on target PCs when opened, although they could have used any Office file.", "But Jaime Blasco, director of AlienVault Labs, told the Guardian his organisation\u2019s sensors had picked up on activity indicating the zero-day vulnerability was being used to attack people in Taiwan.", "\u201cWe have seen several samples, one of them probably targeting Taiwan and delivering the Taidoor malware that has been attributed to Chinese cyber espionage on the past.\u201d Three Google and two McAfee researchers have been credited with disclosing the latest vulnerability to Microsoft."], "title": "China linked to cyber attacks on Taiwan exploiting Windows vulnerability", "article": "Microsoft has warned about a new, unpatched software vulnerability affecting almost all Windows machines, which is remarkably similar to a flaw used in recent cyberattacks on the Ukrainian government. The vulnerability is seemingly now being used in attacks on Taiwanese targets, exploited by hackers creating malicious PowerPoint documents that launched exploit code on target PCs when opened, although they could have used any Office file. Cyber intelligence firm iSight Partners warned last week that a separate but similar bug was being used in so-called \u2018Sandworm\u2019 attacks against the Ukrainian government, the European Union, Nato, French telecom firms and Polish energy suppliers. Russian hackers were suspected of carrying out the attacks. Michael Sutton, vice president of research at security firm Zscaler, said the two vulnerabilities were linked and have been exploited in the same way. \u201cWhile investigating the patch for that initial vulnerability, researchers determined that the fix was not adequate and that the vulnerability could still be exploited,\u201d he said.  There is no clear evidence the latest flaw is being used by the same Sandworm hacker crew. But Jaime Blasco, director of AlienVault Labs, told the Guardian his organisation\u2019s sensors had picked up on activity indicating the zero-day vulnerability was being used to attack people in Taiwan. \u201cApparently the patch that Microsoft released for the Sandworm vulnerability didn\u2019t properly patch it and this new vulnerability exploits that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen several samples, one of them probably targeting Taiwan and delivering the Taidoor malware that has been attributed to Chinese cyber espionage on the past.\u201d Three Google and two McAfee researchers have been credited with disclosing the latest vulnerability to Microsoft. The flaw is resident in all supported versions of Windows except Windows Server 2003. The problem lies in a technology called an Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) object, which is used to share data between various applications. In Office it\u2019s used when parts of a file appear within another file, such as when an Excel chart is included in a PowerPoint presentation. If a target launched a malicious document, likely sent to them via email, they risked handing over control of their computer to the hackers. Using this sole vulnerability wouldn\u2019t directly allow an attacker administrator-level access, which would let them do anything to the PC, but would grant them the same permissions as the victim. In this case, savvier users will also notice the \u2018User Access Control\u2019 popup that will arrive and require consent when a malicious document is clicked on. Microsoft has not stated when it will issue a patch for the bug, but it has included a fix-it solution in its advisory. \u201cWe continue to work on a security update to address this cyberattack. We\u2019re monitoring the threat landscape very closely and will continue to take appropriate action to help protect our global customers,\u201d said Tracey Pretorius, director for response communications at Microsoft. Users have been advised to be careful about opening Office documents sent via email, social media or instant messagers if they have come from unknown parties. They should also be wary of links from untrusted sources, as these may be used to launch a malicious Office file from a criminal hacker\u2019s website. Microsoft said using its Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET), which adds additional layers of protection on certain applications, would help defend against this attack. But the Guardian has learned of a bypass of EMET. This could be used in conjunction with the OLE-based attack to ensure a successful hack. Ren\u00e9 Freingruber, a researcher from Austria-based security firm SEC Consult, managed to bypass the protection features of EMET in a real-world bypass on all Windows versions tested from XP to 8.1, including server variants. In a video showed to the Guardian, Freinburger showed how EMET initially deflected an attack using a known Firefox exploit from 2011 (he used an old, patched flaw so attackers couldn\u2019t abuse code snippets shown at conferences over the last few weeks). But using his tweaked attack code, EMET was made redundant. \u201cIt depends on the actual exploit the attacker wants to execute. In our case, for the sample exploit of Firefox, it would be enough to trick the user into visiting a malicious webpage or adding the exploit code to ad servers for targeted attacks,\u201d Johannes Greil, a fellow researcher at SEC Consult, told the Guardian. Microsoft had not responded to a request for comment on those bypasses. Freinburger showed off his exploit at the Ruxcon Security Conference in Australia earlier this month, but the firm plans to offer more details on the potentially dangerous flaws in the coming weeks. \u2022 Persian paranoia: America\u2019s fear of Iranian cyber power"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/oct/24/technology-links-newsbucket", "publicationDate": "2014-10-24T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "sentences": ["&quot;You can be driving to work and everything is normal, but on your way home, discover a new traffic light.&quot; (Of this possibility, a Google spokesperson said, &quot;We will have to be ready for that.&quot;)  Samsung, TSMC Solid State Lighting reportedly to quit LED lighting business, say Taiwan makers &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Samsung Electronics will reportedly withdraw from the global LED lighting market due to low-price pressure from China-based makers, while Taiwan-based TSMC Solid State Lighting will reportedly cease operations, according to industry sources."], "title": "Boot up: Glass dating, Microsoft and LinkedIn?, mapping London, and a wave", "article": "A burst of 9 links - and a note - for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Girls won&apos;t make a pass at a man in Google Glass, HP exec warns &gt;&gt; Techworld.com  A Hewlett-Packard (HP) executive today warned people not to wear Google Glass on a first date - at least, not if they want to ensure they get a second.\u00a0 Silicon Valley-based Ray Edwards used Wearable World&apos;s Glazed conference in East London to make his feelings on the \u00a31,000 augmented reality headset&apos;s appearance known, before going on to outline which bit of the wearables market HP wants to focus on.\u00a0 The managing director for HP&apos;s New Ventures division, which offers venture capital financing for the most promising technology companies worldwide, took aim at wearable devices like Google Glass and Apple Watch after flying across the Atlantic to make his presentation.\u00a0  Bonus point for the headline.

Analyst: Why Apple Pay won&apos;t work &gt;&gt; America&apos;s Markets  Apple Pay contains a variety of major shortcomings that will likely limit its ability to be the dominant form of payment in the future, according to a UBS note released to clients this week by analyst Steven Milunovich, quoting payments expert Richard Crone at Crone Consulting. The problems with Apple Pay stem from technical shortcomings of the system relative to other alternatives and the large fees Apple plans to charge, which banks will be eager to escape, the report says. \u2026many banks jumped initially on the Apple Pay bandwagon at launch. But banks are likely to build their own apps using more modern technology with clearer benefits for merchants and security for consumers over the next year to three years, the report says.  Published 7 October. That&apos;s, what, two weeks ago. Let&apos;s see how those apps go over the next few years. Google self-driving car: It may never actually happen &gt;&gt; Slate Lee Gomes (who has written repeatedly about the self-driving cars:   Another problem with maps is that once you make them, you have to keep them up to date, a challenge Google says it hasn&apos;t yet started working on. Considering all the traffic signals, stop signs, lane markings, and crosswalks that get added or removed every day throughout the country, keeping a gigantic database of maps current is vastly difficult. Safety is at stake here; Chris Urmson, director of the Google car team, told me that if the car came across a traffic signal not on its map, it could potentially run a red light, simply because it wouldn&apos;t know to look for the signal. Urmson added, however, that an unmapped traffic signal would be &quot;very unlikely,&quot; because during the &quot;time and construction&quot; needed to build a traffic signal, there would be adequate opportunity to add it to the map. But not always. Scott Heydt, director of marketing at Horizon Signal Technologies, says his company routinely sets up its portable traffic signals at road construction sites. Frequently, they are simply towed to a site and turned on. &quot;We just set one up like that in New Jersey,&quot; said Heydt. &quot;You can be driving to work and everything is normal, but on your way home, discover a new traffic light.&quot; (Of this possibility, a Google spokesperson said, &quot;We will have to be ready for that.&quot;)  Samsung, TSMC Solid State Lighting reportedly to quit LED lighting business, say Taiwan makers &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Samsung Electronics will reportedly withdraw from the global LED lighting market due to low-price pressure from China-based makers, while Taiwan-based TSMC Solid State Lighting will reportedly cease operations, according to industry sources.

At a guess, Ara isn&apos;t going to end up as a phone project at all, but something more like Arduino or Rasberry Pi - a playground for hacking things together. The talk is here. Android in pieces &gt;&gt; Jana Mobile Looking at Android use in developing countries, particularly Asia (excluding China):   Worldwide, over 70% of traffic to the mCent app comes from just 20 manufacturers.\u00a0Of the approximately 1,300 device models that make up the user base of the mCent app, 41% are Samsung devices, 7% Motorola, and 7% Sony. Far from being enormously fractured, the Android ecosystem \u2013 even in emerging markets where homegrown, low-cost devices are popular- is fairly uniform. Over half the devices used to access the mCent app for Android are accounted for by the 50 most popular smartphones. Although this may look like a fragmentation problem, these 50 devices come from just 12 manufacturers: 52% are Samsung, 12% are Sony, and 12% Micromax (demonstrating mCent&apos;s popularity in India).  The screen resolutions are quite a surprise.

Driverless cars in Singapore&apos;s Chinese and Japanese Gardens &gt;&gt; Tech In Asia  Stroll down the Chinese and Japanese Gardens, and you&apos;d be able to see driverless buggies cruising down the paths at a leisurely 10km/h. These vehicles, which ferry passengers around free-of-charge, is part of a trial by researchers and engineers from the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) and the National University of Singapore (NUS). The experiment will last from October 23 to November 1 from 8am to 2pm. It will resume again after an evaluation. Visitors to the gardens can book a ride through this website. This is the first time two driverless vehicles have been unleashed for public use. Having two robot buggies in the vicinity also makes things interesting: vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Indeed, the two buggies can talk to one another and figure out ways to move passengers more efficiently.  You can follow Guardian Technology&apos;s linkbucket on Pinboard This is the last Boot Up I&apos;ll be doing, so I thought I&apos;d look back on where it came from. The very first &quot;Newsbucket&quot; (here&apos;s the series link) appeared on 25 September 2007, by Jemima Kiss, entitled &quot;PDA&apos;s Newsbucket&quot;. It was a collection of eight links, with very brief commentary. The links came via Del.icio.us. It was part of the Guardian&apos;s &quot;Media&quot; section, rather than Technology. The idea of the &quot;Newsbucket&quot; was to collect links from all over the web that might be interesting, but didn&apos;t merit a separate story in their own right, or where they offered background information. It&apos;s a place for all the things that you might want to store. Around March 2010, we decided to introduce the &quot;Technology newsbucket&quot; - aiming to be the same thing as the PDA version, but housed in &quot;Technology&quot;. The first appeared on 29 March 2010, and had 11 links - including one about &quot;Why the iPad will change everything&quot;, by arch Apple-sceptic Dan Lyons. \u2022 To collect the links, we first used Delicious, and then (after Delicious morphed from a bookmark service into something indescribable, with a flaky API) Pinboard\u2022 a PHP script I wrote queried Delicious/Pinboard and formatted the links, and output them on a web page;\u2022 the output of the script was put into our content management system. This worked well, and is still how it&apos;s done. I also now use an app called Fake to fill out fields in the CMS, speeding the process further. There was only one problem with calling it &quot;Technology newsbucket&quot;: it didn&apos;t leave much room for the rest of the headline. People like to know what they&apos;re going to read about, even if only approximately.  It took us a year to realise this, but once we did, action was swift. After nearly five minutes of discussion, the decision was made to shorten its name to &quot;Boot up&quot;, because it was meant to start the day, when you&apos;d boot up your.. anyhow.  The first post with that prefix appeared on 18 March 2011, when it attracted a grand total of three comments. The Boot Up blogpost has run more or less continuously every weekday since then, garnering a consistent number of page views most days. It&apos;s rarely the most-read, but it&apos;s been a resource you could rely on. It&apos;s been a fun ride, and I&apos;d like to thank readers, and especially the many commenters for the insightful and helpful additions to the day - the links, shared experiences, discussions, and calming voices brought to exchanges before they got out of hand.

A charismatic, forceful but controversial figure, he led the third political party to attain office. The first had been Kenneth Kaunda\u2019s United National Independence party (UNIP) which ruled until 1991, when multiparty elections were forced on Kaunda by civic action. He was replaced by Frederick Chiluba\u2019s Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), and it was as members of the MMD that Levy Mwanawasa (2002-08) and then Rupiah Banda succeeded to the presidency. Sata led his Patriotic Front (PF) to victory in the 2011 elections \u2013 the fourth time he had contested them. These moves may suggest that Zambia had witnessed changes in the ruling elite and the exercise of power, but this impression would be somewhat misleading. Sata in fact represented continuity, having served in the 1980s as the extremely successful governor of the capital city of Lusaka under Kaunda. He went on to become minister of local government, labour, and health under Chiluba. It was at this time that he became known as King Cobra, for his ruthlessness towards opponents. Sata did not serve in the Mwanawasa and Rupiah governments, because he had sought the succession from Chiluba and was disappointed when it went to Mwanawasa \u2013 another president who died in office and whose final illness, like Sata\u2019s, was carefully but not completely hidden from the Zambian public. After he left the MMD, Sata formed the PF and contested three elections without success. The first, in 2001, was a disaster for him, with his party attaining only one parliamentary seat. However, his doggedness showed through: he regrouped, and the 2006 elections were noted for two spectacular actions on his part. The first was to liken incumbent president, Mwanawasa, to a cabbage. Sata ripped a cabbage to shreds at a rally \u2013 both a symbol of his intent to tear the presidency from Mwanawasa and to remind voters of the rumours that Mwanawasa had been injured in a car accident in 1992. It was a cruel and offensive gesture, but renewed his reputation for ruthlessness and decisive action. At those elections he also attacked Zambia\u2019s Chinese investors, creating a diplomatic storm over disastrous Chinese management of certain copper mines. He threatened to recognise Taiwan, the non-communist Republic of China, and prompted Beijing into a rare moment of panic, threatening to cut diplomatic relations in the event of Sata\u2019s election. When Sata did finally win in 2011, it was with the moderating force of Guy Scott, who became both vice-president and the man in charge of relations with Chinese investors. Scott, who now assumes the interim presidency pending elections within 90 days, has handled these responsibilities with care and finesse. Chinese construction firms are visible in many large Zambian cities as the country enjoys economic success and a building boom. Sata\u2019s period as president saw marked economic growth, but this depended greatly on increases in prices for minerals such as copper: there are clear signs that the boom has peaked and may now be declining. His scathing attitude towards opponents continued to surface and he never lost his King Cobra tag. Nonetheless, he made a positive contribution in promoting the intercommunal spirit favoured by Kaunda. The choice of Scott as president is a case in point. Nowhere else in majority-ruled Africa has a white man succeeded, even if temporarily, to the presidency. Sata had difficulties with the seccession movement in the Lozi kingdom in western Zambia, and his political opponents accused him of human rights abuses, even bringing a complaint to the attention of the Commonwealth secretary general, Kamalesh Sharma, based on alleged breaches of the Harare Commonwealth Declaration on Human Rights. Sata responded to his opponents and detractors with the robustness that might be expected from someone who had laboured as a manual worker, policeman, London station porter, and even as a taxidermist. Born in Mpika, in the north of the country, at a time when it was under British rule as Northern Rhodesia, he had little early education, but later studied privately and gained a degree from the unaccredited Atlantic International University. Unlike Kaunda, he never postured as an intellectual. He saw himself brusquely and bluntly as a man of the people, and used his rough voice, gravel-like from chain-smoking, to great oratorical effect in his no-nonsense speeches. His death, from an undisclosed illness following a period in a London hospital, offers the possibility that Zambia may finally have a new generation in power, even if in the curious continuity of Zambian politics, it has acquired all the characteristics of the old. He is survived by his wife, Christine (nee Kaseba), and eight children. \u2022 Michael Chilufya Sata, politician, born 6 July 1937; died 28 October 2014"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/nov/04/-sp-guo-jian-on-his-art-about-tiananmen-square-im-so-proud-of-what-i-did", "publicationDate": "2014-11-04T04:43:18Z", "tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "China", "Asia Pacific", "Culture", "Australia news", "Censorship", "Protest", "Tiananmen Square protests 1989"], "sentences": ["I kept saying, \u2018well, at least I\u2019m alive.\u2019 My dad was upset too, but they\u2019re really happy I\u2019m out.\u201d His sister reassured him that the family would reunite each Chinese New Year: perhaps Hong Kong one year, Taiwan another."], "title": "Guo Jian on his Tiananmen Square stand: 'I'm so proud of what I did'", "article": "Three days before the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, Guo Jian gathered his friends for dinner. He was calling it his \u201clast supper\u201d, a joke his friends didn\u2019t find too funny. Earlier that day, the 52-year-old had a haircut and cut his nails, motivated by a sense of foreboding that it might be a while before he\u2019d have the opportunity to do so again. The fear was well-founded. The Financial Times had published a lengthy interview with the Chinese-born Australian artist and art teacher that morning, in which he recounted taking part in China\u2019s 1989 pro-democracy hunger strikes and the nightmarish, tragic massacre that followed. Also mentioned was an artwork Guo had been working on: a diorama of Tiananmen Square, mired by war, and then covered in pink, uncooked meat. The works had never left the privacy of his studio, but photos snapped by neighbours had begun circulating online.     The artist\u2019s diorama of an embattled Tiananmen Square. Photograph: Guo Jian    After dinner, Guo returned to his studio, situated on the furthest outskirts of Beijing in an artist village called Songzhuang. \u201cI knew they were coming,\u201d he tells me over the phone. \u201cI looked around and thought: \u2018what am I going to do with my studio?\u2019 My mind was really empty. Waiting and waiting.\u201d It was a little before 1am when the bang on the door finally came. Guo \u2013 expecting just a few policeman \u2013 was greeted by 15 or 20 officers. They began questioning the artist about his artwork, which featured the Beijing landmark in a state of destruction. The artist tried to explain his inspiration for the work: a devouring urbanisation movement that required demolition of large swathes of the country \u2013 including sites of historical significance. Would Tiananmen Square be next? Guo\u2019s piece draws on the visual similarities between a war zone and a demolished building. But all the officers saw was a work that seemed to condone terrorism, no small matter following a 2013 incident in which a car deliberately crashed into the entrance of the Forbidden City, near Tiananmen Square. They arrested the artist, who was still in his sleepwear, and took him to the local police station. In the room they used for questioning there sat a single chair, the metal kind, with hand and leg cuffs. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to sit there!\u2019\u201d Guo tells the story with a wry sense of how absurd his situation was. After officers told him it was the only chair available, Guo still refused. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m going to stand, I\u2019m not a criminal\u2019. So they found another chair. They were trying to scare me.\u201d Guo\u2019s interrogation continued through the night, and he noticed that among the changing rota of officers were more than simply local police. There were officers from the Tongzhou security department, the Beijing city security bureau, and most serious of all, the Ministry of State Security \u2013 the country\u2019s top intelligence and security agency. The officers would often film their questioning, and Guo began to suspect they were planning to frame him on the evening news. True to his Chinese upbringing, Guo\u2019s biggest fear suddenly became what his parents might think \u2013 or more specifically, the public humiliation they would face. Televised criminal confessions are extremely popular in China. \u201cSo I looked at the camera, with that look: \u2018fuck off\u2019. I don\u2019t want them to know I\u2019m scared or give them a chance to make me look like I\u2019m confessing.\u201d After five hours of interrogating, a police officer finally announced they were going to pin Guo with seven and a half years of visa fraud. He was required to sign a document of admission (his visa was, in fact, valid and had been renewed less than one month before), but was reassured that he would be able to leave and return to the country on a new visa. Guo assumed this would mean a few months away at most, and relieved there would be no damage to his friends and family, nor his reputation, signed the paper.     The artist stands in front of an untitled 2012 work. Photograph: Guo Jian    Before serving 15 days of detention, the mild-mannered artist was accompanied by two burly officers \u2013 in deliberately public fashion, he adds \u2013 to collect his belongings from his studio. As neighbours milled about outside, officers confiscated a BB (air) gun that Guo uses as a model for his artwork. \u201cI said, \u2018c\u2019mon I know what you\u2019re trying to do. This is a toy gun. Just put it in box, don\u2019t make people think I\u2019m a terrorist\u2019.\u201d One of the policeman smiled. Sharing one toilet between 13 men is far from comfortable, and Guo says his blanket probably hadn\u2019t been washed in years. But otherwise he appraises the two weeks he spent at the Beijing detention centre as \u201cnot that bad\u201d. He was fascinated by the other people inside, who included two other foreigners, both detained for passport and visa issues. There was also a psychologist who warned Guo against becoming \u201ccannon fodder\u201d for the west, emphasised the strong ties that the artist still has to his country of birth. That same man surprised the artist by going on to admit: \u201cI\u2019m cannon fodder as well, because I work for the Chinese government. You\u2019re cannon fodder, we\u2019re all cannon fodder.\u201d Guo was amused by this display of irony, calling him \u201can OK guy\u201d. By this point international media, including Guardian Australia, had been reporting Guo\u2019s detention, a fact the artist only learned when a representative from the Australian embassy came to visit and offer consular assistance. Guo replied: \u201cI don\u2019t want help, but make sure [you] come back here after 15 days!\u201d in a deliberately loud voice so that it was audible to the detention officers. Guo was driven directly from the detention centre to the airport without any opportunity to say goodbye to family and friends. In the car, the officer told him it would be five years before he would be allowed back into the country. Once again, they were filming him, so Guo spoke directly to the camera: \u201cI want you to pass on this message: I\u2019m not happy. The paper that I signed, I\u2019m not going to keep my promise because you didn\u2019t keep yours.\u201d An overwhelming feeling of relief swept over Guo as he boarded the plane to Australia. It was only after landing in Sydney that he deemed it safe enough to contact his parents, who had discovered his fate online. \u201cMy mum went totally crazy, started yelling how the government is so bad. I kept saying, \u2018well, at least I\u2019m alive.\u2019 My dad was upset too, but they\u2019re really happy I\u2019m out.\u201d His sister reassured him that the family would reunite each Chinese New Year: perhaps Hong Kong one year, Taiwan another.     The artist\u2019s diorama, but this time covered in a thick layer of meat. Photograph: Guo Jian    Despite the five years stipulated for his banishment, Guo has significant doubts as to whether he will ever return to China to live and work. Although provocative art is usually tolerated by the Chinese government, there remains an unspoken (and largely undefined) line that artists are always at risk of crossing. Guo\u2019s public deportation has meant he has booked a permanent place on the authorities\u2019 watchlist, compromising his ability to work freely in China as an artist. As an Australian passport-holder, however, Guo has been able to continue his work elsewhere. The same cannot be said for many other Chinese artists, writers and activists \u2013 including prominent human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang. Pu was also detained this year following a separate commemoration of the Tiananmen Square anniversary, held in private. Guo is in New York, raising funds through Kickstarter for an exhibition called #SURRENDER, a collaboration with the Emerging Collective. The work is described as \u201ca grassroots cry for non-violence\u201d. When nothing but a single piece of undisplayed art, followed by a frank interview published at a time of heightened sensitivity, has forced Guo to leave behind his job, his home and his family in China, it raises the obvious question: was it worth it? Does he have any regrets?  \u201cNo, I\u2019m so proud of what I did,\u201d he says confidently. Try as he might, however, he cannot forget those fateful days at Tiananmen: \u201cI walk on the street, go somewhere with my friends, and those memories are triggered.\u201d And the way in which the Chinese government \u2013 with an almost pathological obsession \u2013 attempts to purge public discourse of any discussion of the massacre, he adds, is proof that they, too, cannot forget."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/10/hotel-wi-fi-infected-business-travellers-asia-kaspersky", "publicationDate": "2014-11-10T17:48:46Z", "tags": ["Data and computer security", "Technology", "Asia Pacific", "Hacking", "Computing", "Wi-Fi", "Hotels"], "sentences": ["Most victims were based in Japan, Taiwan, China, Russia, Korea and Hong Kong."], "title": "Hackers used luxury hotel Wi-Fi to steal business executive's data, researchers say", "article": "Business executives visiting luxury hotels in Asia have been infected with malware delivered over public Wi-Fi networks, Russian security firm Kaspersky Lab has discovered. The so-called \u2018Darkhotel\u2019 hackers managed to tweak their code to ensure that only machines belonging to specific targets were infected, not all visitors\u2019 PCs, and may have included state-sponsored hacking. They also seemed to have advance knowledge of their victims\u2019 whereabouts and which hotels they would be visiting, Kaspersky said.  CEOs, senior vice presidents, sales and marketing directors and top research and development staff were amongst those on the attackers\u2019 hit list, though no specific names have been revealed. As soon as they logged onto the hotel Wi-Fi, targets would be greeted with a pop-up asking them to download updates to popular software, such as GoogleToolbar, Adobe Flash and Windows Messenger. But giving permission to the download would only lead to infection and subsequent theft of data from their devices. State-sponsored hackers could have exploited the tools The attackers were targeting usernames and passwords for Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Twitter accounts of American and Asian executives, ostensibly hoping to carry out sustained snooping following initial infection, Kaspersky Lab\u2019s Costin Raiu told the Guardian.  He believes the perpetrators could have had multiple motivations and may have seen nation state-sponsored hackers and cyber criminals using the same attack tools. \u201cSo far all victims we have been able to trace are very important people and they make sense in the context,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe what we have here is the same framework being used by two different groups - one with a focus on other nation states, the other focusing on business interests\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be abnormal. \u201cI know that at least one of the victims was particularly staying in a hotel because she attended a conference event in that particular city.\u201d Having acquired access to server logs on machines once used by the Darkhotel actors, and having sent researchers to the various hotels, Kaspersky determined the attacks date back to at least 2009. Most victims were based in Japan, Taiwan, China, Russia, Korea and Hong Kong. They weren\u2019t just using hotels to spread their malware, including an advanced keylogger. They also infected peer-to-peer networks like BitTorrent - in one case spreading via a file containing \u201can anime sex/military comic scene, exposing the likely interests of potential targets\u201d - and sent out emails with malicious attachments. Using the latter technique, the attackers targeted defence firms, governments, and NGOs, using lures on topics including nuclear energy and weaponry capabilities. \u2018A sophisticated and highly skilled attack\u2019 Their attacks used zero-day vulnerabilities - those that haven\u2019t been seen before nor fixed by vendors - in popular software, such as Internet Explorer and Adobe Flash. They also signed their code with seemingly legitimate certificates, designed to prove the authenticity of applications, though they were likely duplicated by the attackers to bypass system defences here. In one case it appeared a certificate had been stolen from a Certificate Authority (CA). Both the zero-days and the certificates indicated a high level of skill amongs the Darkhotel hackers, according to Kasperksy. Onlookers have been surprised by the targeted nature of the Wi-Fi attacks. \u201cThis type of targeted attack is uncommon. The steps taken to infect the machines and factors that have to be in place for it to work make it a very specialist type of infection,\u201d said Mark James, security specialist at anti-virus firm ESET. Richard Cassidy, senior solutions architect at Alert Logic, added: \u201cWe are seeing a very sophisticated attack on the target networks by this cell, who have put a great deal of thought into what information they want, who they are targeting and how to write malware that provides the best chance of getting what they\u2019re after.\u201d Anyone concerned about such attacks has been advised to use a Virtual Private Networking (VPN) tool, which will encrypt data so attackers\u2019 can\u2019t read the plain text of web communications.  \u2018State sponsored\u2019 Russian hacker group linked to cyber attacks on neighbours "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/11/alibaba-singles-day-sales-china-break-records", "publicationDate": "2014-11-11T16:58:31Z", "tags": ["Alibaba", "China", "Business", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "E-commerce", "Internet", "Technology"], "sentences": ["The company said most overseas buyers on its websites hailed from Hong Kong, the US and Taiwan."], "title": "Alibaba\u2019s Singles Day sale in China breaks online records", "article": "Chinese online retailer Alibaba has already taken more than $9.3bn (\u00a35.85bn) in sales on Tuesday as Singles Day, the country\u2019s biggest online retail event, dwarfs other sales bonanzas around the world such as Black Friday in the US or Christmas in the UK. The live sales figure on Alibaba\u2019s giant screen at its sprawling Hangzhou campus surged past the 57.1bn yuan ($8.16bn) mark with two hours left to go, as Chinese and overseas shoppers snapped up heavily discounted items online. The company, which floated in New York at $25bn just eight weeks ago, easily smashed its sales record of $5.8bn last year. Alibaba said it had taken just 20 minutes to reach $1bn in sales \u2013 compared to an hour last year. The company started marketing the 11 November Singles\u2019 Day event \u2013 the Chinese reaction to Valentine\u2019s Day \u2013 in 2009, turning it into an online shopping bonanza over the years as rival online stores offer discounts lasting a week or more. Joe Tsai, Alibaba Group\u2019s executive vice-chairman, said: \u201cYou\u2019re seeing the unleashing of the consumption power of the Chinese consumer. We really are witnessing history here because we are seeing the shift of the economy \u2013 from focused on the state sector to consumption.\u201d Last year, Alibaba\u2019s websites and other Chinese online retailers together sold about $9.3bn worth of goods on Singles Day \u2013 about 10 times more than on a typical shopping day in the country and nearly five times the amount sold in the US on Cyber Monday \u2013 the Monday following Thanksgiving and the world\u2019s second largest online sales event. By comparison, US retailers took $1.2bn on Black Friday (the Friday following Thanksgiving), and $1.7bn on Cyber Monday last year via the internet, according to Comscore. The nearest equivalent in the UK is Christmas, with \u00a311bn spent online over the whole of December. Last year, Black Friday made its breakthrough in the UK and sales are expected to expand again this year and become one of the UK\u2019s most important shopping days, alongside Easter and Boxing Day.

The company said most overseas buyers on its websites hailed from Hong Kong, the US and Taiwan. However, the date, which coincides with armistice day when Europe remembers its war dead, means the day is unlikely to take off here. Singles Day in China was invented by students in the 1990s as Bachelors\u2019 Day \u2013 a day to meet prospective partners and hang out with single friends eating deep-fried dough sticks representing the four ones in 11.11 or steamed buns which represent the dot. It was chosen because of the many 1s in the date resemble \u201cbare branches\u201d, the Chinese expression for bachelors and spinsters. Alibaba copyrighted the \u201cDouble 11\u201d term in 2012. Jeff Walters, partner at The Boston Consulting Group in Hong Kong, said clothing was the main item sold last year while food, including nuts, have been one of this year\u2019s hot sellers. Walters said research suggested individual shoppers planned to spend around 15% less on Singles Day this year than last, but as the total number of shoppers had increased by 20% to about 360 million, Singles\u2019 Day would still be the biggest online sales event ever. But he added a note of caution, saying: \u201cPromotions are becoming more common throughout the year, making Singles Day less \u2018special\u2019\u201d."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/12/tracking-isis-stalking-cia-big-brother-online-nsa", "publicationDate": "2014-11-12T12:05:09Z", "tags": ["Internet", "Technology", "Data and computer security", "Cybercrime", "Open source", "Data protection", "Computing", "Software"], "sentences": ["\u2022 China linked to cyber attacks on Taiwan exploiting Windows vulnerability"], "title": "Tracking Isis, stalking the CIA: how anyone can be big brother online", "article": "\u201cOur choice isn\u2019t between a world where either the good guys spy or the bad guys spy. It\u2019s a choice of everybody gets to spy or nobody gets to spy.\u201d So said the security luminary Bruce Schneier at BBC Future\u2019s World-Changing Ideas Summit in October. He was considering a world in which the metadata zipping around us and the static information sitting on web servers across the globe is accessible to those with the means and the will to collect it all. With so many cheap or free tools out there, it is easy for anyone to set up their own NSA-esque operations and collect all this data. Though breaching systems and taking data without authorisation is against the law, it is possible to do a decent amount of surveillance entirely legally using open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools. If people or organisations release data publicly, whether or not they mean to do so, users can collect it and store it in any way they see fit.  That is why, despite having a controversial conviction to his name under the Computer Misuse Act, Daniel Cuthbert, chief operating officer of security consultancy Sensepost, has been happily using OSINT tool Maltego (its open-source version is charmingly called Poortego) to track a number of people online.  Over a few days this summer, he was \u201cstalking\u201d a Twitter user who appeared to be working at the Central Intelligence Agency. Maltego allowed him to collect all social media messages sent out into the internet ether in the area around the CIA\u2019s base in Langley, Virginia. He then picked up on the location of further tweets from the same user, which appeared to show her travelling between her own home and a friend or partner\u2019s house. Not long after Cuthbert started mapping her influence, her account disappeared. ISIS intelligence But Cuthbert has been retrieving far more illuminating data by running social network accounts related to Islamic State through Maltego. By simply adding names to the OSINT software and asking it to find links between accounts using commands known as \u201ctransforms\u201d, Maltego draws up real-time maps showing how users are related to each other and then uncovers links between their followers. It is possible to gauge their level of influence and which accounts are bots rather than real people. Where GPS data is available, location can be ascertained too, though it is rare to find accounts leaking this - only about 2% of tweets have the feature enabled, says Cuthbert. He has been trying, with mixed results thanks to Twitter\u2019s deletion of accounts spreading Isis propaganda, to determine how tech savvy its members are and how they operate online. Over the past month, Cuthbert has looked at links between a number of pro-Isis users, including one with the handle @AbuHussain104, who has only tweeted 28 times, yet has more than 1,300 followers already. The prominent pro-sharia law Islamic activist Anjem Choudary has been a keen retweeter of Hussain\u2019s words.

Though he is dubious about the veracity of some of the beheading footage, Cuthbert, who also produces documentaries, says the films are well edited. Having gathered intelligence a handful of influential accounts, Cuthbert is now on the lookout for slipups that reveal the true identity or location of the tweeter. \u201cThis is a concern for high-ranking Isis leaders, so much so, they issued a guide on using social media,\u201d he notes, referring to reports of an as-yet unconfirmed document. Whether they are Isis members or not, web denizens are prone to giving away a lot on social networks, but businesses are often guilty of failing to clean up after themselves too. Recorded Future, another provider of OSINT tools that also came up against Twitter\u2019s censors, claims to have coverage of more than 600,000 open web sources across seven languages from which to find patterns or useful data.  In October it found that 44% of Fortune 500 companies have had employee usernames and passwords leaked online this year. The credentials, stolen during small-scale cyber attacks using freely traded exploit tools against unpatched sites and servers, were posted on variety of forums and paste sites, according to Recorded Future.  Metagoofil, which runs on Linux or Mac machines, is an ideal software for uncovering data businesses have mistakenly leaked onto the internet. Running this free tool in a Linux distribution, hackers can command it to hunt for files related to a particular domain, specifying how many Google searches to look through and how many documents to download. It will then extract whatever metadata the user is looking for and store it all in a file for perusal later on. Getting creepy with Shodan For those who want instant visual results, the Shodan search tool is a remarkable piece of work. Simple searches can reveal miraculous details. For instance, type \u201cIP camera\u201d into the search bar and more than 1.3m internet-connected IP cameras show up from across the world. Add \u201ccountry:gb\u201d and you\u2019ll be shown more than 54,000 based in Great Britain. You could specify a manufacturer too, such as Samsung. That provides just 13 results. From there, it\u2019s a matter of clicking on the IP addresses to see which ones allow you to view live footage either with or without a password (if you guess the password, even if it\u2019s a default one such as \u201cadmin\u201d, it will mean you are likely to have broken the Computer Misuse Act).  Either way, it is very easy to find poorly secured cameras - many have a username of \u201cadmin\u201d and no password whatsoever, according to previous research. It is that straightforward: no coding skills required.  I ran a search for webcamXP, which bills itself as \u201cthe most popular webcam and network camera software for Windows\u201d, and uncovered a large number of UK-based feeds without any authentication (see images below). One was inside a classroom at Lancaster University, which ironically has one of the top cyber security research teams across UK academia. I managed to view an entire seminar free of charge (though there was no sound and there was nothing useful to be gained other than looking at the morose faces of students awake before midday).  The university took down the feed soon after the Guardian disclosed its discovery. Many showed footage from inside people\u2019s living rooms. They are likely to be oblivious to the fact that anyone on the web can see into their lives, unless they simply do not care. As a pro-privacy writer, I am choosing not to publish images from inside people\u2019s homes. But my searches made it apparent anyone can create their very own voyeuristic version of Gogglebox, all because people have neglected to put usernames and passwords on their CCTV cameras. Even a search as simple as \u201cdefault password\u201d on Shodan will bring up reams of results, showing you exactly what login credentials are needed to access things like routers and web servers. It is startling how much insecure kit there is on the internet. It is possible to take information found on Shodan and use it for even more malicious means such as data theft. For hackers, the search service provides a marvellous way to see how many vulnerable systems are open and ripe for compromise. Searching for systems running the now unsupported Windows XP (meaning it is vulnerable to many exploits - though you will need proper security skills to exploit them) brings up fruitful results - 54,000 machines in fact.  A search for all UK government organisations running Windows XP brings up 36 servers, a number of which are based in Whitehall, including one at the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office. Using targets selected with Shodan, anyone with basic knowledge of hacker tools that throw exploits at vulnerabilities in XP would most likely be able to compromise scores of machines running the OS. Using OSINT for good If Shodan and other OSINT tools can be used by malicious hackers, they can and are used by ethical ones too. Their initial aims are the same: to find and take advantage of vulnerabilities. It is only that penetration testers are paid by companies to break into networks to show where weaknesses lie and how to keep others out.  \u201cThe tools are mostly for reconnaissance,\u201d says Christian Martorella, creator of Metagoofil and theHarvester, another OSINT software that pentesters - or \u201cethical hackers\u201d - use to map their clients\u2019 internet footprint. \u201cThis helps the pentester to have as much information as possible about the targets and plan the attacks. This phase is very important but ... pentesters usually overlook this phase or dedicate little time, while attackers seem to spend more time in this phase.\u201d Privacy-conscious folk can also benefit from OSINT. While looking into how his internet service provider [ISP] was interfering with his internet connection, in a method similar to that used by Verizon for its controversial \u201cpermacookie\u201d tracking software, researcher Lee Brotherston last month used Shodan to find servers that intercepted his traffic. The wide range of Perftech servers he found were based across the world, and though his ISP was simply using a \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d technique to add a warning banner to a website he visited, Brotherston was concerned such interference has been used in the past by repressive regimes to spy on people\u2019s web activity. What if the ISP was coerced by a government and dropped malware onto people\u2019s machines as they tried to access websites? The much-maligned surveillance tool FinSpy is used for just for that purpose: it is placed into the data centres of ISPs and intercepts traffic to force surreptitious downloads of surveillance software. Instead of dropping banners, as Brotherston\u2019s ISP did, it injects malicious JavaScript. \u201cWhen you hear about repressive governments that start installing malware on activists\u2019 machines and then arresting them\u2026 it\u2019s the same technique. They\u2019re injecting data into a webpage,\u201d says Brotherston, a Canada-based Brit. \u201cIf you\u2019re injecting this, you may have a valid business case for doing, it but someone could break in and start dropping malware on people\u2019s machines.\u201d A number of developers, inspired by the success of Shodan creator John Matherly, have drawn up search sites for hackable systems. Perhaps the most useful for security professionals, whether of the blackhat or whitehat variety, is the Kickstarter-funded PunkSPIDER, a web app vulnerability search engine, which issues an alert as soon as the visitor arrives: \u201cPlease do not use this site for malicious purposes \u2026 use it wisely or we\u2019ll have to take it away\u201d. It\u2019s remarkably simple. Type or paste in a URL and it will reveal what vulnerabilities have been documented for the related site. I spy \u2026 a surveillance state Such is the openness of the web, and such is the carelessness of so many web denizens, any determined citizen can gather up reams of sensitive information on others and collect enough data to create a decent picture of who they are, where they are and what they are doing. The tools are now accessible for the typical web user.  As the work of Cuthbert and Brotherston attests, such operations can have ostensibly \u201cgood\u201d intentions. Although I felt uneasy looking at people through their CCTV cameras without them knowing, I was at least able to alert Lancaster University to the problem so it could take action. But as security expert Schneier said in an email discussion with the Guardian, it is not the \u201caverage web user\u201d that should concern us. Rather, it is those who use OSINT as a starting point for more malicious means. \u201cIt\u2019s other countries, it\u2019s criminals, it\u2019s hackers. And you can\u2019t design a surveillance system that only the people you want are able to exploit it.\u201d  As the US and UK governments demand that the likes of Apple and Google do not close off users\u2019 data to intelligence agencies and law enforcement with high-grade encryption, they are also asking technology companies to open up more avenues for criminals to do their own snooping.  \u2022 China linked to cyber attacks on Taiwan exploiting Windows vulnerability"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/15/first-book-award-the-shortlist", "publicationDate": "2014-11-15T08:00:00Z", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Guardian first book award", "Awards and prizes"], "sentences": ["Lin Zhengyi was a model soldier, one of the most celebrated young officers in the army of Taiwan, the island province ruled by opponents of the Chinese Communist Party.", "For three decades Taiwan had defied Communist control, and Captain Lin was a symbol of that resistance: in college, he had been a star student who\u2019d given up a placid civilian life to join the military, a decision so rare that Taiwan\u2019s future president made a point to shake his hand, and the picture was splashed all over the newspapers, turning Lin into a poster boy for the \u201cHoly Counterattack,\u201d the dream of retaking mainland China.", "After 30 years of turmoil, China was appealing to the people of Taiwan to reunify the \u201cgreat Motherland\u201d."], "title": "Guardian first book award: the shortlist", "article": "Colin Barrett: Young Skins Jonathan Cape. Short stories Young Skins is a collection of seven stories, six being set in the same fictional, rural west-of-Ireland town called Glanbeigh. The main characters are mostly young. They are petrol station forecourt attendants, senior nightclub bouncers, or just dangerously at a loose end. They are spooked, dazed, resilient, resigned, prone to dark laughter and rage. Routine is the spine that runs through the days of their lives, and while some characters cling to that routine, others seek to shatter it. The usual things that transpire within the confines of any small town transpire here: misjudgments and violence, affairs and kindnesses, silences and eruptions.     Colin Barrett. Photo By Lucy Perrem.    I grew up in a town like this, knew people infused with the same peculiar sensibility as this cast of characters, but do not let me mislead you by implying I have any authoritative judgment to deliver on this world. What fascinated me as I worked on these stories and incrementally built the world of Glanbeigh was how little I truly understood the people and places of this town. But intimacy and mystery are not mutually exclusive, and are in fact often inextricably entangled. Thankfully, art thrives within this ambivalence. And so I resolved to draw the characters as meticulously and vividly as I could, but to simultaneously preserve the integrity of their essential unknowability. The short story, as a form, attracts me because of its capacity to access and maintain intensities \u2013 tonally, atmospherically, linguistically \u2013 that more capacious narrative forms too often cannot tolerate. In this way, the short story is closer to poetry than to the novel, and despite their brevity, the best short stories require the same attentiveness from the reader \u2013 they cannot be browsed or skim-read. But the reward of that attention is a discharge of aesthetic intensity unique to the form. Anne Enright has described John McGahern\u2019s stories as the \u201cliterary equivalent of a hand grenade rolled across the kitchen floor\u201d. \u201cExplosion bears repeating,\u201d Barry Hannah, another adherent of the form, once wrote. In some of my stories the explosion is coming; in others the characters inhabit the ringing aftermath. It is up to readers to judge, but that is what I wanted these stories to be infused with: the pure combustibility of being alive. Extract from \u2018Diamonds\u2019:  I left the city with my connections scorched and my prospects blown, looking only for somewhere to batten down for the winter to come. I left on a bright morning in August, dozing fitfully as the train drifted through the purgatorial horizontals of the midlands, heading west. The midland skies were huge, drenched in pearlescent light and stacked with enormous chrome confections of cloud, their wrinkled undersides greyly streaked and mottled, brimming with whatever rain is before it becomes rain. Each time I came to and checked the carriage window the same cow seemed to be eyeing me from the same sodden, tobacco-brown field. Or each cow bore the same expression; the huge jaws mechanically working a wad of cud back and forth, the dark eyes registering me with the same steady, sullen incuriosity.            I was not well. I was drinking, too much and too often, and had resolved to stop. In the city I had drank away my job, money, a raft of friendships, one woman, and then another. My cat, a princely tortoiseshell tom named Ruckles, succumbed to a heart attack after eating a phial of damp cocaine he\u2019d unearthed at the bottom of my closet while I was out on another all-night jag. Ruckles\u2019 passing got me to thinking, in a vague and wistful way, of dying by my own hand. I began to consider my hands in the starlight of bar-rooms\u2014 the brittle wrists and yellowed skin, the nicks and weals and livid pink burn marks of unknown origin\u2014and realised I was already way along on that project. It was go home or die, and home was an oblivion that was at least reversible.   I was thirty-three and had no extant family in the town. My parents were in the cemetery, my only sibling, an elder sister, moved to the States years back, and those locals who were once my friends were now grown strangers. It was my old secondary school principal that saved me. The principal was of a type, the Sentimental Authoritarian, who have always proven susceptible to my charms. Recalling my teenage athletic prowess \u2014 I had been the star of the football team, driving Saint Carmichael\u2019s boys to three successive provincial finals and winning two \u2014 he found me a sinecure as groundskeeper and part-time gym teacher. He had seen a talent burgeon under his institution\u2019s aegis, and did not want to think it truly snuffed out. I admitted I had come into this low ebb entirely of my own accord, but he assured me in time I could make things right.  Henry Marsh: Do No Harm  Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. Memoir I have kept a daily diary since the age of 13, and writing it became an important form of catharsis for the stresses and strains of my work as a neurosurgeon. I also tried to record and bear witness to the sometimes wonderful and sometimes terrible things I see every day at work \u2013 for a brain surgeon\u2019s life is never boring. I would occasionally read parts of it to my wife (Kate Fox, an anthropologist and writer), who suggested I make it into a book. I wrote it over a number of years, though I soon understood that the secret of writing a good book is to listen to criticism \u2013 from my agent and editor, friends, and in my case (though often rather grumpily) my wife.     Henry Marsh    Doctors are often seen as either heroes or villains. Patients, in their natural anxiety, put us on pedestals in the hope that we can perform miracles, and they are then bitterly disappointed if we fail. As doctors we often respond to this by behaving as though we really are on pedestals, although this is also, in part, because we cannot afford to become too close to our patients. All doctors have to live with a profound contradiction: the ethical imperative for our work is that we should only treat our patients as we, or our family, would wish to be treated, and yet we quickly learn that it is almost impossible to treat \u2013 or, as a surgeon, to operate on \u2013 somebody you know well. You are simply too anxious; you are insufficiently detached. I try, in Do No Harm, to show what it is really like to be a brain surgeon: based on my daily work, the stories are about the fierce joy of operating and the difficulty of balancing compassion and professional detachment; they show how we doctors are as human as our patients. Alas, we are just as liable to make mistakes, but it is extraordinarily painful and difficult to admit to our own fallibility and to deal with its sometimes awful consequences. Extract from the chapter \u2018Aneurysm\u2019  I never saw any neurosurgery as a medical student. We were not allowed into the neurosurgical theatre in the hospital where I trained \u2013 it was considered too specialized and arcane for mere students. Once, when walking down the main theatre corridor, I had had a brief view through the small porthole window of the neurosurgical theatre\u2019s door of a naked woman, anaesthetized, her head completely shaven, sitting bolt upright on a special operating table. An elderly and immensely tall neurosurgeon, his face hidden by a surgical facemask and a complicated headlight fixed to his head, was standing behind her. With enormous hands he was painting her bare scalp with dark brown iodine antiseptic. It looked like a scene from a horror film.            Three years later I found myself in that same neurosurgical operating theatre, watching the younger of the two consultant neurosurgeons who worked in the hospital, operating on a woman with a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. The staff in the theatre were silent. There was none of the usual chatter and talk. Neurosurgeons sometimes describe aneurysm surgery as akin to bomb disposal work, though the bravery required is of a different kind as it is the patient\u2019s life that is at risk and not the surgeon\u2019s. The operation I was watching was more like a blood sport than a calm and dispassionate technical exercise, with the quarry a dangerous aneurysm. There was the chase \u2013 the surgeon cautiously stalking his way beneath the patient\u2019s brain towards the aneurysm, trying not to disturb it, to where it lay deep within the brain. And then there was the climax, as he caught the aneurysm, trapped it, and obliterated it with a glittering, spring-loaded titanium clip, saving the patient\u2019s life. More than that, the operation involved the brain, the mysterious substrate of all thought and feeling, of all that was important in human life \u2013 a mystery, it seemed to me, as great as the stars at night and the universe around us. The operation was elegant, delicate, dangerous and full of profound meaning. What could be finer, I thought, than to be a neurosurgeon? I had the strange feeling that this was what I had wanted to do all my life, even though it was only now that I had realized it. It was love at first sight. I went home that night and announced to my wife that I was going to be a brain surgeon. She looked a little surprised, given that I had been so undecided about what sort of doctor I should be, but she seemed to think the idea made sense. Neither of us could have known then that my obsession with neurosurgery, and the long working hours and the self-importance it produced in me, would lead to the end of our marriage twenty-five years later.  Fiona McFarlane: The Night Guest  Sceptre. Novel A friend of mine was researching Victorian nursery rhymes and cautionary tales and happened to mention how many of them are populated by wild animals: lions; elephants; crocodiles and tigers. This fascinated me; I loved the idea of the secure British nursery being invaded by hordes of colonial animals, figures of terror, wonder, domination and the uncanny. It made me think, too, of all the strange tigers in children\u2019s literature, from Rudyard Kipling\u2019s Shere Khan to Judith Kerr\u2019s The Tiger Who Came to Tea, and in particular of a wonderful Australian children\u2019s book called Jandy Malone and the Nine o\u2019Clock Tiger (the tiger, in this instance, is Tasmanian). I knew right away that I wanted to write about a modern woman with some kind of colonial background whose house is haunted by this kind of nursery tiger. At around the same time, I heard the story of an elderly man whose cleaner convinced him they were married, and moved into his house and in on his bank accounts.     Fiona McFarlane    These ideas came together when I started writing The Night Guest. I created Ruth, aged 75, widowed, and living in a house on the New South Wales coast \u2013 a house she begins to suspect contains a nocturnal tiger. Ruth, the daughter of missionaries, grew up in Fiji and she thinks of this childhood as extraordinary, particularly compared with the ordinariness of the rest of her life. The arrival of the tiger returns her to the urgency of her youth: he is consequential, and she is consequential with him. Ruth is joined, too, by Frida, a carer of magnificent moods, whose presence in Ruth\u2019s daytime house is as strong and strange as that of the tiger at night. And Ruth is beginning to suffer from dementia; her world is blurring, and she is both frightened of and fascinated by it. I\u2019ve seen dementia do its painful work on people I love, and I wanted to imagine it from the inside. I wanted, too, to write a character who resists our cultural expectations of older women. Ruth is kind and sensible but not floral and insipid. She swears and has sex but isn\u2019t eccentrically feisty. I wanted, most of all, to make her visible: her loneliness and her pleasures, her memories and opinions and desires, and the precise limits of her independence. The work of inhabiting Ruth was by far the greatest challenge \u2013 and pleasure \u2013 of writing The Night Guest. Extract:  Ruth woke at four in the morning and her blurry brain said, \u2018Tiger.\u2019 That was natural; she was dreaming. But there were noises in the house, and as she woke she heard them. They came across the hallway from the lounge room. Something large was rubbing against Ruth\u2019s couch and television and, she suspected, the wheat-coloured recliner disguised as a wingback chair. Other sounds followed: the panting of a large animal; a vibrancy of breath that suggested enormity and intent; definite mammalian noises, definitely feline, as if her cats had grown in size and were sniffing for food with huge noses. But the sleeping cats were weighing down the sheets at the end of Ruth\u2019s bed, and this was something else.        Photograph: press     She lay and listened. Sometimes the house was quiet, and then she heard only the silly clamour of her beating blood. At other times she heard a distant low whine followed by exploratory breaths. The cats woke and stretched and stared and finally, when whatever was in the lounge room gave out a sharp huff, flew from the bed and ran, ecstatic with fear, into the hallway, through the kitchen, and out the partially open back door. This sudden activity prompted an odd strangled yowl from the lounge room, and it was this noise, followed by louder sniffing, that confirmed the intruder as a tiger. Ruth had seen one eating at a German zoo, and it sounded just like this: loud and wet, with a low, guttural breathing hum punctuated by little cautionary yelps, as if it might roar at any moment except that it was occupied by food. Yes, it sounded just like that, like a tiger eating some large bloody thing, and yet the noise of it was empty and meatless. A tiger! Ruth, thrilled by this possibility, forgot to be frightened and had to counsel herself back into fear. The tiger sniffed again, a rough sniff, thick with saliva. It turned on its great feet, as if preparing to settle down. Ruth sent one courageous hand out into the dark to find the phone on her bedside table. She pressed the button that was programmed to summon her son Jeffrey, who would, in his sensible way, be sleeping right now in his house in New Zealand. The telephone rang; Ruth, hearing the creak of Jeffrey\u2019s throat as he answered the phone, was unrepentant.  Evan Osnos: Age of Ambition  Bodley Head. Reportage Age of Ambition began with a riddle, a question I couldn\u2019t answer for myself about a place that I thought I had come to know: how was it that China had catapulted itself into a position of such economic vitality, while it remained the world\u2019s largest authoritarian state? I had been living in Beijing for five years, watching the lives of people around me undergo fundamental transformations \u2013 some inspiring, some dispiriting \u2013 and was desperate to understand what was going on beneath the surface of that experience. China is so vast that we are tempted to write about it in broad terms, but I felt that was a mistake; the deepest, most consequential changes in people\u2019s lives have been private and perceptual \u2013 changes in the way they see themselves.     Evan Osnos    I decided that for understanding this moment in time \u2013 a change in the lived experience of one-fifth of humanity \u2013 I needed to render both sides of that contrast with equal intensity, both the economic openness and the political limits. I followed people over the course of several years, including the dissident artist Ai Weiwei; a young woman named Gong Haiyan who made millions in the business of online dating; and a young teacher, Zhang Zhiming, who was struggling on the margins of China\u2019s boom years, trying to get a seat on this great locomotive, but finding that others had been given an inside tip, and he was left behind. They are united by a clear sense of aspiration, often unfulfilled, to reorder their own worlds in ways that previous generations would have found absurd. I lived in Beijing from 2005 to 2013, and I was fortunate to be able to travel widely. I returned to people many times, collected the documents of their lives \u2013 court records in some cases, journals and diaries in others \u2013 and sought to render their lives in as much detail as I could. We are right to acknowledge the differences in their lives and ours, but, ultimately, those are superficial, and, if I\u2019ve done my job as a writer, they point to a deeper sense of what we have in common. At a time when China and the west can seem to be moving farther apart, I have tried to record the fact that, on the ground, we have never shared more sensibilities and experience. Extract:  MAY 16, 1979   Under a sliver of moon, on an island off the coast of China, a twenty-six-year-old army captain slipped away from his post and headed for the water\u2019s edge. He moved as calmly as possible, over the pine scrub to a ledge overlooking the shore. If his plan were discovered, he would be disgraced and executed.            Capt. Lin Zhengyi was a model soldier, one of the most celebrated young officers in the army of Taiwan, the island province ruled by opponents of the Chinese Communist Party. For three decades Taiwan had defied Communist control, and Captain Lin was a symbol of that resistance: in college, he had been a star student who\u2019d given up a placid civilian life to join the military, a decision so rare that Taiwan\u2019s future president made a point to shake his hand, and the picture was splashed all over the newspapers, turning Lin into a poster boy for the \u201cHoly Counterattack,\u201d the dream of retaking mainland China. Lin Zhengyi stood nearly six feet tall, with ramrod posture, a broad, flat nose, and jug ears that protruded from the rim of his hat. His devotion had earned him the assignment to the most sensitive place on the front line: the tiny island of Quemoy, known in Mandarin as Jinmen, barely one mile, across the water, from the rocky coast of mainland China. But Captain Lin had a secret so dangerous to him and his family that he did not dare reveal it even to his wife, who was home with their son and pregnant with their second child. Captain Lin had awoken to a sense of history gathering around him. After 30 years of turmoil, China was appealing to the people of Taiwan to reunify the \u201cgreat Motherland\u201d. Any soldier who tried to defect to the mainland would be shot on sight. The few who tried were exceedingly rare, though the consequences were vivid; the most recent case had occurred less than a month ago. But Lin had heard his calling. China would prosper again, he believed. And he would prosper with it. In the darkness he found the sandy path that could lead him safely down a hill laden with land mines. The wind off the sea had bent the gnarled island pines. The water, a brilliant crystal green by day, was now an endless black mass, surging and withdrawing with the waves. Just before the captain left the tree line for the dash to shore, he loosened the laces of his shoes and stepped barefoot onto the soil and stone. He was ready to abandon his fellow soldiers, his family, and his name.  May-Lan Tan: Things to Make and Break  CB editions. Short stories I\u2019m at The Mirage in Las Vegas. It\u2019s dark. The ghost of George Harrison sings, \u201cSomething in the way she moves ... \u201d as a shoal of barefoot aerialists in white dresses whoosh around on zip wires, streaking black comets of hair.     May-Lan Tan    A tension arises between song and spectacle. Here are 12 or 13 girls rendered indistinguishable from one another, yet the lyrics praise one girl\u2019s specificity. I wonder why the singer feels obliged to project the notion of individuality on to this person. And why he talks about her instead of to her. It\u2019s as if the pretence is not for her benefit but for his or someone else\u2019s. To whom is he telling the story? How does it concern them? Does the relationship between the subject and object involve, or even require, this ancillary presence? She \u2013 the mover, the wooer, the knower \u2013 is the protagonist of this story, but she has no agency except to be as enigmatic and idiosyncratic as she can be. A spotlight flits across the darkness and alights on one aerialist, and I feel that the singer is speaking about her, the performer. She is beautiful and brave. She will be perfectly OK without him. I think I hold in my body every book I will ever write, and moments like this show me which ones to use. Does the singer refer to these girls in the singular because he\u2019s consolidated all of them into a composite being? Or are they iterations or instances of The One; do they represent her ubiquity? Perhaps they signify all of the girls who are not her. Is she a fantasy? Is he? I start to think of all the identities we create and destroy; how selves merge and how the self multiplies. Of shadows, doubles and projections; and how we cast other people as surrogates or substitutes to help play out our unfinished stories. I think of the mystery and solace of the Other; the coding of love and sex; and subtle shifts in the power balance. Of soft shocks and unexpected pleasures. Extract From \u2018Julia K.\u2019:  Language, as she deployed it, was neither a line cast nor a bullet fired. It was a catholic mechanism: the sharp twist of a pilot biscuit into the waifish body of a christ. A word, placed on her tongue, became flesh. One night it was almost morning, I could almost see her, every sentence a necklace she was pulling out of her mouth, tangled in smoke.            \u201cI want to be filthy with beauty,\u201d she said, \u201cloaded on stink and swagger. I want to be heart on bicep, balls in throat, with my best friend\u2019s eyes in my pocket, and a flaming comet of hunger clutched in my fist like a pet rock. \u201cI want to be a jet-fuelled mass of chrome and steel, circling the planet with an infinite supply of packaged almonds, missing no one, my strong, clean body rippling in the heat that rises from the landing strip, my little feet, wheels that never fail to find it. \u201cI want doll skin,\u201d she said, \u201csticker eyes. I want to be a black flash of lashes against a desiccated white lie, stamped with a smooch. I want bendable limbs, high-heeled feet and a plastic snatch. \u201cI want to cut teeth. To break bones in the street and use the pieces to draw pictures with my blood on the sides of buildings. I want to be the city melting behind the glass, and I want to be the glass, inlaid with wire mesh so when it breaks it hangs together still. And I want to be the breaks. \u201cBut I know what I am,\u201d she said then, \u201cI\u2019m like you: the sweet spot, the rough patch, the missing rib. \u201cI\u2019m the coyness, the wheedle, faked passion, icicle tears, small betrayals, the accommodating orifices, the warm welcome and the long way back. I\u2019m the pout, the prettiness, and dreams of the real thing. I am hard knocks and lost loves. I\u2019m just like a real person \u2014 in a movie. I\u2019m how much it hurts and how much that\u2019s part of it.\u201d She finished her cigarette. I leaned in to taste her mouth. It tasted bloody and torn apart. When I smeared her against the slide, she was a true thing bursting open in silver pieces against the pale fresh silent playground. Later, I lit up and she stayed lying down. Each time I pulled on the cigarette, the cherry burned a short film of her face moving against itself, the way rain wriggles down glass. There was something horrific in it. I let my smoke rise, and then I fastened my belt and walked away.

The island is a model for all small nations on and off the pitch and with a population under 200,000, is smaller than most. \u201cIn the two years I have been here we have moved from 196 in the world to 162 and we are above Thailand and Hong Kong. Our goal is to get into the one hundred and thirties and keep moving forward.\u201d With opportunities limited at home and the travel bug biting, it made sense for White to head overseas for work when he stopped playing at semi-pro level aged 21 to focus on coaching full-time. After a spell in Australia working with young players and opening his own academy White heard in 1998 that smaller federations around the world had received Fifa money for development purposes and the hiring of foreign coaches. He was immediately working the phones and six weeks later became the head coach of the British Virgin Islands. He considered it the perfect start for a 24-year-old coach, an opportunity to learn, experiment and make mistakes away from the spotlight and Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas certainly agreed, succeeding the Englishman when White caught the eye of the Bahamas, a bigger nation. Nine good years in the Caribbean were followed by time spent in Seattle working in the US youth development system. Then, in 2012, he met Richard Lai. He is full of praise for the Guam Football Association\u2019s president, an influential figure in Asian football politics. Lai used Fifa grants to get things ready off the pitch and just needed the right coach. White said: \u201cThe facilities were as good as anywhere in the world but the belief was not there. They had been beaten for years and wanted just to keep the scoreline down. We found the best players who could play for Guam.\u201d Many of those feature at various levels in the US. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to sell this to players in America who had seen past scorelines but now the majority of our players are professionals. \u201cWe have changed the thinking and how they approached the games. We have a small pool of players and they have to play well every game. It is exhausting but we are getting results. I see coaches sometimes be standoffish with players but you have to see them and treat them as people. Little things like a birthday phone call from the coach when they are in the US and you are in Guam, it makes a difference. They want to play for Guam.\u201d He may have professionalised the scene but White has also connected the national team to the indigenous Chamorro culture, instigating a form of haka called the inifresi before games. \u201cThe fans and the team love it; it creates a bond and a brand.\u201d He recalls a game against Taiwan in Myanmar in qualifying for the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup. Losing 3-0 to a team they used to beat easily, the men from Taipei started to foul, leading to a ruckus that caused the entire Guam bench to \u201cclear in record time\u201d to support those on the pitch. \u201cThousands of Myanmar fans began chanting \u2018Guam, Guam, Guam\u2019. They could see our support of each other.\u201d At the same time White was studying at the English FA\u2019s two-year elite coaching programme, which started in 2011 \u2013 one of 16 hand-picked \u2018potential elite\u2019 coaches, all under 40 and with the highest possible pass marks on the Uefa A licence course. He loved it, despite an estimated total of 260 hours jet-setting back and forth between job and classroom. \u201cWith the reputation of English football, people expect I will play direct football but they don\u2019t know the developments of the game in England. We have young coaches who are as good as anywhere, this new generation know the modern game and will challenge the thinking of the past. We were the first group, though the program is continuing. There was lots of practical stuff and as I was already the head coach of Guam could constantly try on the pitch what I had just learned on the course.\u201d Such qualifications and experience should give White plenty of options at home and overseas \u2013 at least that was the plan. \u201cA lot of players are just starting their coaching career now. I knew playing wouldn\u2019t give me the edge but starting my coaching career earlier than anyone else would.\u201d It may in terms of experience and know-how but a good playing career opens doors. \u201cThere are many more opportunities for ex-players in England because that is the culture. The thinking is that if you have hundreds of games at the top level then you must know what you are doing but playing and coaching are two different professions. A lot of clubs are fearful of new faces. I have had success with limited resources but instead a club will bring in someone who has failed at two other clubs just because he was known as a player. You need stronger leadership in clubs, so they try something, someone, new.\u201d Such as White. England\u2019s top level may not be the immediate target \u2013 a club in Japan, Korea or China would do for now \u2013 but it is a medium-term goal. \u201cI want to go back and prove to people what I can do. Why don\u2019t clubs bring in people who have a point to prove? Isn\u2019t that mentality good for the club and fans? Ultimately I am English and want to be leading my national team, instead of other people\u2019s.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/nov/19/street-food-ice-cream-peanut-wrap-taipei-run-bing-taiwan", "publicationDate": "2014-11-19T10:06:49Z", "tags": ["Cities", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific", "Ice cream and sorbet"], "sentences": ["I think it represents the inventiveness and creativity of Taiwan street vendors that ends up getting imitated around the world, like gua bao (pork belly buns with ground peanuts) and snowflake shaved ice."], "title": "Real street food - No 4: Ice-cream and peanut wrap from Taipei", "article": "What is the dish? This ice-cream wrap with peanut candy shavings and coriander looks like a run bing (spring roll). What\u2019s the history?

What does it taste like? Tart and creamy from the ice cream, sweet and crunchy from the peanut candy shavings and the coriander gives it an extra aromatic layer. How is it served?     The ice-cream \u2018spring roll\u2019 usually comes wrapped in plastic    The flour crepe is laid out, then peanut candy shavings are placed on top from a wooden tool which is used to shave the peanut candy block. Three scoops of ice cream are set in a row on top, then another layer of peanut candy shavings, and then coriander. The edges are folded in and then it\u2019s rolled like a wrap or burrito and placed in a plastic bag.  Anything extra? The coriander is optional, but I strongly recommend trying it. The ice cream flavours vary from vendor to vendor, but I like it with pineapple, taro and peanut ice cream. Why should someone try it? Because it\u2019s an ice-cream burrito! What\u2019s the bill? Usually around NT$40 (80p). Where can you get it? You can find it at many of Taipei\u2019s night markets \u2013 one of my favourites is at Tonghua/Linjiang. I also had a great one recently at Shenkeng Old St, where the vendor added salt to the peanut candy block, which accentuated the sweetness of the peanut candy and ice cream. Can you make it at home? You could try making your own version with some tortillas, or crepe, crushed peanut brittle and ice cream. If you could make the run bing wrapper then that would be perfect.  What does this dish say about Taipei? Taipei has amazing street food and night markets and this dish is just one of many amazing things. I think it represents the inventiveness and creativity of Taiwan street vendors that ends up getting imitated around the world, like gua bao (pork belly buns with ground peanuts) and snowflake shaved ice.      Home made ice-cream wrap. Photograph: David O'Sullivan    Recipe: Homemade run bing with pineapple and peanut ice cream Just make one flavour of ice cream if you prefer, or use shop-bought. Serves 6 For the pineapple ice cream: 400g tin pineapple or 300g fresh pineapple, chopped  \u00bd tin condensed milk 400ml double cream For the peanut ice cream: \u00bd tin condensed milk 500ml double cream 125g peanut butter For the brittle: Butter, for greasing  100g roasted, salted peanuts 150g caster sugar To assemble: 6 frozen spring roll wrappers, defrosted Handful of coriander leaves, chopped Method: To make the pineapple ice cream, put the fruit (drained, if using tinned) in a food processor or whizz with a stick blender to a smooth puree.   In a separate bowl, whisk the condensed milk and cream to stiff peaks, then fold through the fruit puree, mixing fully or leaving slightly marbled, if you like. Pour into a lidded, plastic, freezer-proof container, then freeze until firm, around 4 hours.  To make the peanut ice cream, put all the ingredients in a bowl then whisk to stiff peaks. Pour into a lidded, plastic, freezer-proof container, then freeze until firm, around 4 hours. Next, make the brittle. Grease a small baking tin, then put the peanuts in a large, dry frying pan, then, over a medium heat, toast until golden. Add a pinch of salt, then add the sugar, swirling, but not stirring, the pan, until the sugar has melted and turned to a dark golden colour. Pour into the baking tin and allow to harden. To assemble, lay a spring roll wrapper on a work surface, then grate or crumble over a generous amount of peanut brittle. Top with three scoops of ice cream \u2013 just peanut, just pineapple, or a mixture, if you like \u2013 then add more brittle and a scattering of coriander. Working quickly, fold in the top and bottom of the wrapper, then roll up. Repeat with the rest of the wrappers, and eat immediately.

Plastic cards had not been invented so the cash machine was fed with cheques and paid out one \u00a310 note at a time. And we\u2019ve never looked back since.

The longer view of the Cheshire\u2019s seven years at the helm remains firmly positive. He inherited a mess, imposed central controls on a fragmented group and binned failed foreign ventures in South Korea and Taiwan. At the low point, before Kingfisher started to generate cash again, you could have picked up the shares for under 100p. What the past six month\u2019s current share price says is that self-help measures are no match for a French slump.

Use bombers. Bomb Germany, France, Italy, Greece, the entire eurozone. Bomb\u00a0them with banknotes, cash, anything to boost demand. The money must go straight to\u00a0households, not to banks. Banks have had their day and miserably failed to spend. From now on they get nothing. Five years after the financial crash it\u00a0is nearly unbelievable that the eurozone\u2019s lords and masters now confront renewed recession. They seem inert before deflation, subflation, lowflation or whatever lets them avoid the word \u201cscandal\u201d. An ever more dominant Germany is unmoved. Its finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, is set on \u201cblack zero\u201d or a balanced German budget. The European Central Bank (ECB) murmurs about \u201cquantitative easing\u201d but is up against Germany\u2019s furious protests. Ten per cent of the eurozone\u2019s workforce is unemployed and one in five\u00a0of its young. Greece has lost a quarter of its national product. The waste of resources is staggering. At the heart of this tragedy stands the absurd figure of the new EU president, Jean-Claude Juncker, impresario of Luxembourg\u2019s outrageous tax-evasion oasis. Yesterday he proposed a \u20ac21bn European fund which, he claimed implausibly, would entice private backers to invest \u201cup to\u201d 15 times the sum. Who will invest when there is no demand? The pope rightly called the EU \u201celderly and haggard\u201d, mistrusted, insensitive and bureaucratic. I doubt if Juncker turned a hair. The eurozone is heading towards what even the pro-EU Economist calls \u201cEurope\u2019s lost decade\u201d. Ever since the credit crunch the continent has been suffering what Keynes called a classic liquidity trap. There is too little money around and thus a chronic shortage of demand. People have too little to spend, which\u00a0means shops close, supplies dry\u00a0up and no one invests. Britain and the US supposedly met this challenge by \u201cprinting money\u201d, by quantitative easing (QE). This was a\u00a0confidence trick. It claimed to release money \u201cinto the economy\u201d to stimulate borrowing and thus spending. It merely channelled billions into bank vaults and\u00a0boosted reserves. What did spill into the economy went to stock market inflation and obscene bonuses. In Britain it also leaked into the mad world of sub-prime housing subsidies. Otherwise, demand has remained dangerously sluggish. What saved Britain was George Osborne not practising what he preached. He borrowed and spent like a crazed Labour\u00a0chancellor. Borrowing has risen,\u00a0not fallen, and this year is 10% up on last year. Public spending is still higher than in 2010, welfare payments are up, mega-projects are booming; only\u00a0hated local government is down. To Osborne, austerity is for the small guy \u2013 and a gullible media. The eurozone has no such luck. Germany continues to defy the two great minds of 20th-century economics, Keynes and Friedman. They clashed on much but agreed on the need to \u201cloosen\u201d money supply to avert recession. Keynes buried it in the ground and had the poor dig it up. Friedman more generously dropped it\u00a0from helicopters. Such methods have long been ridiculed as vulgar by conventional economists and politicians.To them economics is a branch of ethics. Monetary policy should punish the poor for its extravagance in booms, not \u201creward\u201d the undeserving. Any money going should be channelled through the welfare state or the great and good banks. Yet versions of helicopter money (HM) are now emerging into public debate. The essence of HM is not to boost government spending \u2013 and thus challenge \u201cbudgetary austerity\u201d \u2013 but to print money off-budget to avert deflation. It\u00a0is\u00a0like giving blood to a shattered body: without it, all other remedies are\u00a0a\u00a0waste of time. Such \u201cneo-monetarism\u201d is aired by the Financial Times\u2019s Martin Wolf in his\u00a0new and exhaustive study of the credit crunch, Shifts and Shocks. He suggests \u201cpermanent helicopter money\u201d, with government deficits simply covered by printing presses unless and until inflation returns. It has been discussed sympathetically by Tim Congdon, by the Americans Mark Blyth and Eric Lonergan in the magazine Foreign Affairs, and by the former City regulator, Lord Turner. All challenge the conventional wisdom of bank-led reflation. John Muellbauer, professor of economics at Oxford, champions \u201cQE for the people\u201d. He points out that, as existing policies to revive Europe\u2019s growth have faltered, \u201cproposals for distributing money directly to citizens have been quietly gaining traction among critics of orthodox central banks.\u201d The commentator Anatole Kaletsky points out that if the \u00a3375bn of QE had gone to private bank accounts rather than to buying bonds from banks, it would have meant \u00a324,000 per British family. This would have transformed the demand economy. To have government simply depositing cash in cashpoints or handing out spending vouchers at post offices might seem eccentric. But this has been done in Japan, China, Vietnam and Taiwan, where cash and vouchers have yielded swift spending surges. HM has been adopted by aid organisations including Give Directly in Africa, sometimes tied to school attendance. Brazil and Mexico have likewise \u201cdropped\u201d cash on poor communities. All these schemes were declared resounding successes. The west\u2019s brief flirtation with HM through car scrappage schemes is credited with having saved the US car industry. Why are policies considered suitable for developing societies not relevant to Europe? The answer, I believe, is not intellectual or political but rather a matter of class. Just to print money and hand it out leaves people vulnerable to \u201cmoral hazard\u201d. People should not get cash they have not deserved. If demand\u00a0is to be stimulated with cash, it should be through someone responsible, like a banker. If the banker in effect \u201csteals\u201d the money, too bad. I imagine that even if Friedman and Keynes banged together on the door of the EU or the ECB, those inside would send them packing. These institutions are in a line of descent from those who sealed Europe\u2019s fate with the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, the Great Depression and the 2008 credit crunch. They seem happy to visit on Europe a \u201clost decade\u201d. Meanwhile, the bombers are on standby. The printing presses can roll and Europe can be saved. But who will\u00a0throw the switch?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/nov/28/global-slavery-index-walk-free-human-trafficking-anne-gallagher", "publicationDate": "2014-11-28T13:52:59Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Human trafficking", "Law", "Migration and development"], "sentences": ["After noting that little reliable information exists on slavery in China, the index\u2019s authors declare that they are comfortable with China being considered pretty much the same as other east Asian nations like South Korea, Taiwan and Japan."], "title": "The global slavery index is based on flawed data \u2013 why does no one say so? | Anne Gallagher", "article": "In the 20 years I have been working in the field of anti-trafficking, it has moved from the margins to the mainstream.

One of the great frustrations of the anti-trafficking field has been the absence of hard data. We know that millions of people in all parts of the world are trapped in situations of exploitation. But human exploitation takes many different forms, occurs largely among hidden populations, and is notoriously difficult to find, let alone quantify in any meaningful way. That is a problem for those working to address such exploitation because pushing for change becomes difficult, if not impossible.  This creates an almost irresistible temptation to make a silk purse out of a very tattered sow\u2019s ear: to harness the power of statistics and numbers to create an illusion of concreteness that masks the slipperiness of what we are counting.  It is understandable that Walk Free, a new player seeking to make its mark in a highly competitive environment, has succumbed to that temptation. Less forgivable are the weaknesses that mar the substance of the index and compromise its findings: a mysterious, inconsistently applied methodology, a raft of unverified assumptions and multiple, critical errors of fact and logic. Even the basic unit of measurement of \u201cmodern slavery\u201d is flawed: the definition is self-created and, bizarrely, changes from one year to the next.  The methodology used (pdf) to establish the prevalence of slavery is extremely crude: random sample surveys in seven countries and derived data involving three others, supplemented by existing survey data of highly variable quality from a further nine.  Even the well-informed reader will struggle to understand how the fragile sample data from 19 countries (10 from Walk Free data, nine from secondary sources) was so confidently extrapolated across to the remaining 148. The division of surveyed countries into six \u201cclusters\u201d for extrapolation purposes has some very peculiar results: Egypt classified as \u201chigh income\u201d for example, and Hong Kong falling behind China on the same measure.  At some points, application of the extrapolation \u201cprotocol\u201d verges on the ludicrous. For example, Thailand and Brunei are claimed to have the same proportion of their populations enslaved \u2013 a risible assertion to anyone with even cursory knowledge of the situation in those two countries. Incredibly, the number of slaves in South Africa is calculated on the basis that this country is 70% like western Europe (because \u201chistorically, South Africa has been culturally similar to western, democratic nations\u201d) and 30% like Africa. After noting that little reliable information exists on slavery in China, the index\u2019s authors declare that they are comfortable with China being considered pretty much the same as other east Asian nations like South Korea, Taiwan and Japan.  Despite these and many other egregious flaws, critical examination of the index has been oddly muted. One wonders whether the avalanche of statistical and quantitative research jargon is deliberately intended to have a confusing and silencing effect.  Other possible explanations for the lack of critical engagement are even more worrying, because they concern the rather grubby realities of power and funding. The leadership of Walk Free appears to enjoy unfettered access to the global elite; securing glowing endorsements of the index from Clinton to Blair, Bono to Branson. For the mainstream media and pretty much everyone else, this was more than good enough. With marginal exceptions, coverage of the index has been uniformly fawning and superficial. The resounding silence from the anti-trafficking community and its failure to engage critically with the index is also disquieting and deserves scrutiny. Walk Free, along with its various subsidiaries, has come to the big table with seductive promises of abundant funding at a time when previously generous government donors are flagging. A number of international organisations, such as the International Labour Organisation \u2013 now a partner (pdf) in Walk Free\u2019s Global Slavery Fund \u2013 and individual experts in a strong position to critically evaluate the index have been effectively co-opted through partnerships and advisory roles.  Why does all of this matter? The most immediate problem is that poor information, presented as fact, contributes to poor decision making and sometimes highly damaging, unintended outcomes.  Another grave concern is the distorting effect that organisations such as Walk Free and tools like the index are having on how we understand and respond to human exploitation. Put simply, by failing to challenge or even gently interrogate the underlying structures that perpetuate and reward exploitation, the index embodies and perpetuates a comforting belief that slavery is all about bad individuals doing bad things to good people. At the root of this belief is an unshakable faith in us being able to eliminate slavery without fundamentally changing how our societies and economies are organised; without a radical shift in the distribution and exercise of political and economic power, including a global economy that depends on the exploitation of poor people\u2019s labour to maintain growth and a global migration system that entrenches vulnerability. In the words of Peter Buffett, this is not much more than \u201cphilanthropic colonialism\u201d, the advocacy and giving that \u201cjust keeps the existing structure of inequality in place\u201d. Only the shortsighted would oppose an injection of energy, commitment and resources into the battle against slavery. If Walk Free proves capable of producing reliable and replicable data through the consistent application of quality methodology, then this will be a valuable contribution to improving understanding of how exploitation happens and why. But that is not happening yet. And, even while we collectively obsesses over numbers and data points, we would do well to consider how far we are all willing to go in attacking the structures that preserve and nourish a world built solidly on the foundations of human exploitation.

The demonstrators\u2019 unsuccessful bid to surround government buildings crossed a line for the Beijing authorities and their local surrogates. Intentionally or not, it presented a direct challenge to monolithic Communist party rule. This was both brave and dangerous. Whether the location is Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang, Taiwan, or further afield, such l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 will not be tolerated by Xi Jinping, crowned as China\u2019s president last year, and his self-selected Politburo retinue. Their grip on power is not as watertight as it might seem. They fear Hong Kong\u2019s rebelliousness may prove contagious, and weekend municipal elections in Taiwan made the point. After a winning run in power dating back to 2008, the pro-Beijing Nationalist party, formerly known as the Kuomintang, suffered nationwide reverses. Taiwan\u2019s premier, Jiang Yi-huah, resigned. Although discontent with the government\u2019s domestic policies played a part, so too did escalating worries that China\u2019s anti-democratic stance in Hong Kong could be forcibly applied to Taiwan. Beijing officially views Taiwan as a \u201crenegade province\u201d of China, rather than what it is \u2013 a de facto independent country. Last spring demonstrators opposed to China\u2019s growing influence, known as the Sunflower Movement, stormed Taiwan\u2019s parliament, chanting: \u201cToday Hong Kong, tomorrow Taiwan.\u201d Some in Taiwan have taken to carrying umbrellas in solidarity with Hong Kong\u2019s umbrella movement. The election losses, which included the capital, Taipei, could upset plans by the Nationalist leader and president, Ma Ying-jeou, to hold a historic summit with Xi. They have also raised the hopes of the opposition Democratic Progressive party that they can win back the presidency in 2016. If that happens, relations with Beijing are likely to deteriorate sharply. The impact of Hong Kong\u2019s upheavals on Taiwan is not lost on Beijing, which issued a slightly rattled statement after the polls: \u201cWe hope compatriots across the [Taiwan] Strait will cherish hard-won fruits of cross-strait relations, and jointly safeguard and continue to push forward peaceful development,\u201d it said. China\u2019s approach to Hong Kong carries chilling echoes elsewhere, according to Jonathan Fenby, a respected China analyst. \u201cThere have been signs in recent months that Xi Jinping and his colleagues have decided to toughen their stance on [Taiwan] in line with their broader attempt to impose conformity and centralisation and to impose order on China\u2019s peripheral regions of Xinjiang and Tibet,\u201d wrote Fenby last month. \u201cCross-Strait travel restrictions have been tightened. Official media have alleged plots against the People\u2019s Republic hatched by Taiwanese \u2018separatists\u2019 manipulated by clandestine Japanese or American groups \u2026 \u201cBeijing\u2019s insistence that it ultimately calls the shots in Hong Kong under the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 has gone down badly in Taiwan.\u201d A recent upsurge in separatist violence in Xinjiang, a largely Muslim region of western China, seems to have encouraged Xi\u2019s tough line countering political dissent \u2013 or was possibly provoked by it. Xi recently proclaimed a more conciliatory approach to international foreign policy issues, including island and resource disputes with Japan and some south-east Asian nations. But the crackdown in Hong Kong will render China\u2019s democratically ruled neighbours, victims of Beijing\u2019s bullying since Xi took power, more not less wary. Xi\u2019s recent, awkward first meeting with Japan\u2019s leader, Shinzo Abe, did nothing to dispel deep mutual distrust. The Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia all have cause for increased nervousness, despite Chinese goodwill gestures at last month\u2019s Apec summit in Beijing. Nor is China\u2019s developing alliance with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia an encouraging sign. The prospect that Xi would adopt a softer line on Hong Kong and other disputes closer to home was similarly remote, said commentator Dean Cheng. \u201cSuch a move would be fraught with risk for Xi. A conciliatory stance could be seen as weakness rather than strength, both by Xi\u2019s factional rivals, but also by other elements in China who are agitating for greater freedom. \u201cThe Tibetans and Uighurs in the Tibet and Xinjiang Uighur autonomous regions, for example, would likely seize upon such an opening to militate for greater self-rule in these areas, a liberalisation which Beijing has made clear it is not prepared to countenance. \u201cIt is important to recognise that Xi is still in the midst of his power transition. As the first Chinese leader to have assumed power without the blessing of a revolutionary-era leader (such as Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping), his position within the CCP [Chinese Communist party] is more vulnerable than any of his predecessors,\u201d Cheng said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/01/guardian-view-on-the-continuing-protests-in-hong-kong", "publicationDate": "2014-12-01T19:44:45Z", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Hong Kong", "Taiwan"], "sentences": ["Taiwan is a case in point.", "This may have been because voters felt that he acted less than wisely in dealing earlier this year with the Sunflower student movement, which demanded that increased trade with the mainland be monitored to prevent it being used by China to gain political influence in Taiwan."], "title": "The Guardian view on the continuing protests in Hong Kong | Editorial", "article": "China\u2019s obsession with control is the enemy of sensible policy. If nothing that comes from outside the ranks of the governing elite can ever be permitted, and indeed must on principle be opposed simply because it does come from outside, the result will be rule that is simultaneously timid, fearful, and harsh. That is the lesson of Hong Kong, where both the local authorities and Beijing have made misstep after misstep. The result is that the police are still beating and arresting student demonstrators more than a month after the first, peaceful, protests against the Chinese government\u2019s insistence that it must control who can and who cannot stand for the position of chief executive. True, the number of demonstrators has fallen, as has popular support for their cause. True, the use of force has been, so far, relatively restrained. The situation is manageable, but that does not mean that China has won, if by winning is meant winning over that large proportion of the population of Hong Kong who want their city to have the autonomy and gradually evolving democracy they believe they were promised, and in return for which they were ready to offer a qualified loyalty to Beijing. What China has done in Hong Kong will preserve control but deepen alienation. It will have a price, too, outside China, where it is seen as yet another indication that compromise and the Chinese communist party are strangers to each other, whether in dealing with non-Han minorities, in territorial issues with neighbours or in relations with other major states. Taiwan is a case in point. The disastrous results for the ruling Kuomintang in the weekend\u2019s elections there mainly reflect the unpopularity of President Ma Ying-jeou, a good man who lost his political touch, rather than than any deliberate repudiation by voters of his and his party\u2019s relative closeness to Beijing. Yet the fact that the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula has been almost completely discredited by events in Hong Kong is part of the context. Mr Ma\u2019s criticism of Beijing in a speech last month in which he supported the Hong Kong demonstrators and called for China to move toward constitutional democracy did him no good electorally. This may have been because voters felt that he acted less than wisely in dealing earlier this year with the Sunflower student movement, which demanded that increased trade with the mainland be monitored to prevent it being used by China to gain political influence in Taiwan. But it is also true that the narrative of convergence to which Mr Ma tried to appeal has lost its power. The Chinese are prisoners of another narrative, in which China\u2019s rise is a phenomenon benefiting its neighbours as much as itself, in which opponents are seen as a tiny minority manipulated by hostile powers, and in which democracy is a flawed western concept that has no relevance for China. The refusal to allow the British parliament\u2019s foreign affairs select committee to visit Hong Kong is typical of this deeply counterproductive attitude. If there are Chinese officials who understand this, they have yet to show their hand."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/dec/02/morning-mail-tony-abbott-down-in-polls-abc-cuts-serve-audience-hottest-spring-on-record", "publicationDate": "2014-12-01T21:34:53Z", "tags": ["Australia news"], "sentences": ["\u2022 Taiwan\u2019s cabinet has resigned en masse after the ruling party suffered a massive defeat at the island\u2019s biggest ever local elections."], "title": "Morning Mail: Tony Abbott down in polls, ABC cuts 'serve audience', hottest spring on record", "article": "Good morning folks, and welcome to the Morning Mail \u2013 sign up here to get it straight to your inbox every weekday morning.

This dollop of The Hunger Games has been frontloaded more than previous ones \u2013 opening simultaneously in close to 90 territories rather than 40-something \u2013 so no surprise either that it is ahead of the last two at the second-weekend mark: $254.6m overseas against $146.1m. What is concerning is that many individual countries are tracking lower than Catching Fire at the same point. Most rich countries grossed lower this weekend, and their overall second-week take also dropped; that\u2019s even happening in some emerging markets, like Russia (Catching Fire, second weekend: $5.4m; Mockingjay: $2.5m).               It\u2019s in less mature markets, like Mexico (Catching Fire: $4.3m; Mockingjay: $4.4m) and Brazil ($2.7m; $3.8m), where affection seems to be building. It\u2019s probably too early \u2013 especially with $480.3m already banked, and given the law of cleft final chapters described last week \u2013 to declare a general cooling-off. But it\u2019s interesting for anyone given to thinking about blockbusters in geopolitical terms that, to adopt Hunger Games parlance, heat for the franchise is now burning strongest outside the Capitol. Laddie marmalade There\u2019s no doubt that StudioCanal\u2019s fondly received Paddington adaptation has got off to a very fine start. Michael Bond\u2019s diminutive bear has nipped between the legs of The Hunger Games for an $8m No 1 in his UK home market, the second best family-film debut in 2014 after The Lego Movie. Paddington\u2019s homeland, Peru, also got the film in its first week, where it did a tidy $405,000 \u2013 less than other kids\u2019 fare there this year, like Mr Peabody and Sherman ($491,000), but higher than Interstellar ($369,000).               Lacking a local tie-in, Paddington didn\u2019t make as much of a splash in the much larger Mexican market, its other inaugural territory, taking little more than $1m. Translated into 30 languages and having sold 30m books, there\u2019s no doubt that the dude in the duffle coat has worldwide appeal \u2013 which is why StudioCanal are releasing their film in 40 countries through to next February. Judging by the UK result and the superior quality, Paddington shouldn\u2019t flinch from believing he can match the mighty worldwide grosses chalked by his predecessors in the mixed live-action/CGI kids\u2019 bracket: The Smurfs (2011, $563.7m), Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007, $361.3m), Stuart Little (1999, $300.1m) and Yogi Bear (2010, $201m). Flightless birds     Rudderless Skipper \u2026 Penguins of Madagascar\u2019s disappointing returns could herald the end for the franchise. Photograph: DreamWorks Animation/AP    Picking up a penguin was not top priority for American audiences this weekend, with Dreamworks\u2019 Madagascar spin-off debuting at a chilly $25.4m ($36m with Thanksgiving takings included) \u2013 despite sheltering under the franchise umbrella and being based on a popular Nickelodeon cartoon. That\u2019s a low for the series, well below the first film\u2019s $47.2m in 2005. Possibly it found itself squeezed between sharper-looking animation Big Hero 6, and the Hunger Games juggernaut, which swept off many of the adults who might otherwise have been attracted by the in-jokey overtures now standard for CGI cartoons (how many kids are going to get a Werner Herzog shoutout?). As emphasised in the trailers, Penguins of Madagascar also follows the global-location itinerary (Venice, Shanghai, New York) demanded of big studio films these days. But it looks unlikely that its real-world passage will leave flames behind it. The early Chinese release ($30m+ and counting) bulks out a sparse-looking initial whip-round ($36.5m overseas this week in 45 territories, compared to Madagascar 3\u2019s $77.2m from 25 in 2012). With plenty left on its rollout \u2013 including the UK this week, where Cumberbatch fever (he voices a covert-ops wolf) should win it fans \u2013 it should make good on a $132m outlay. But the Madagascar series could be running low on juice. Loss leaders              The Horrible Bosses franchise looks an even more conspicuous candidate for collecting its belongings and leaving the building after a shaky start for the sequel. A haul of $15.5m Stateside for director Sean Anders (also co-writer on other current top 10 denizen Dumb and Dumber To) is underwhelming, to put it mildly - nearly half of the first\u2019s $28.3m in 2011. Taking $11.3m from 44 international locales is even more disappointing, with even the best results scraping into the medal places (Russia, $1.8m, No 3; UK, $2m, No 4; Germany, $1.1m, No 4; Mexico, $1.1m, No 3). The strange thing is that the second film is an improvement in some ways \u2013 more coherently plotted, and featuring snappy editing that shows off the souped-up budget (up $8m to $43m). So what\u2019s gone wrong? I\u2019d lay it at the door of Warners\u2019 garbled marketing, which has failed to freshen up the hashtag immediacy of the original film\u2019s premise: Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell playing \u201cpsycho\u201d, \u201cmaneater\u201d and \u201ctool\u201d respectively. New bosses Christoph Waltz and Chris Pine \u2013 the venture-capitalist father-and-son duo in charge of the torment this time \u2013 don\u2019t register as succinctly in the sequel. That has trickled down into ineffectual posters and ads that fail to pull the same trick twice: convincing the perpetually online, zero-hours generation currently in their 20s that a comedy starring three men in their late 30s and early 40s is about them. The rest of the world After Johnnie To\u2019s recent Don\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart 2, yet another metropolitan love triangle landed high in the Chinese charts (and 7th worldwide) in the shape of Women Who Flirt, directed by Pang Ho-cheung, the Hong Kong veteran responsible for 2010\u2019s lauded Love in a Puff. As well as the $11.5m or so it took around Asia, it also enjoyed an $80,000 snifter in the US, despite reviews taking varying degrees of umbrage with its throwback frivolity. Three places below it in the global rankings, with $8m, is The Best, the Lost \u2013 another Chinese film mining another contemporary trope, the halcyon-days 1990s college drama made big business by So Young, which took $114m in 2012.             In top place in France and 14th globally, the ninth Asterix animation, Land of the Gods, opened at $5m, an upwards move for the pigtailed Gallic insurrectionist, here making his first CGI outing, after a $3.4m bow for Asterix and the Vikings in 2006. That still lacks the crucial magic-potion ingredient compared to $20m-ish French debuts for the live-action (and big-budget) Asterix films of recent years. A return of $3.4m for the Korean action comedy Big Match was good for second spot there and 15th in the worldwide list. Lee Jung-jae stars as a mixed martial-arts star forced into a series of real-time hi-tech games in order to save his brother\u2019s life. Who said Hollywood had a monopoly on daft high concepts?  The future Penguins of Madagascar, Horrible Bosses 2 and Paddington all continue their rollouts next week \u2013 the last hoping to prove its mettle on a global stage in the key markets of France, Brazil, Germany and Japan. Ahead of its US opening on 12 December, Ridley Scott\u2019s Moses epic Exodus: Gods and Kings stakes out safe theological ground with early engagements in Catholic countries including Mexico, Spain, Argentina and the Philippines, and also South Korea, whose Christian population is larger than its Buddhist one; Noah followed a similar pattern. Singham star Ajay Devgan leads the line on the $15.3m Indian action comedy Action Jackson, one of Bollywood\u2019s most expensive for 2014 (Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s Happy New Year, at $21m, is reportedly the priciest). Adapted from the Telugu film Dookudu, having seemingly acquired some Kill Bill stylings on the way, Action Jackson is also getting the typical diaspora-oriented overseas release through Eros International. And December blockbuster season began in earnest in China on Tuesday, when the first part of John Woo\u2019s The Crossing pushed off the jetty.

My parents still laugh when they recall how I ran straight past it, mesmerised by the presents under the tree, and then did a double-take worthy of Louis de Fun\u00e8s as I spotted it sitting under the mantelpiece. Two years later my Christmas present was a shiny silver BMX, formerly owned by a boy the year above me at school, with an orange plastic saddle that sometimes tipped up and slid me off the back of it. And then there was my first geared bike \u2013 a pink step-through with a basket and a three-speed Sturmey Archer hub, on which I did my first cycle-camping trip (with my father to carry the tent) when I was eight. And for my 10th birthday I was given a big black mountain bike with two brakes and 18 gears, which I rode until I was big enough to reach the pedals on my father\u2019s Muddy Fox.     Emilly Chappell on a camping trip with her father and pink step-through bicycle. Photograph: Emilly Chappell    Most bike lovers could reel off a similar list of old friends and lost loves. What stands out from many of them is just how many bikes people have owned and ridden by the time they reach adulthood. Because, as we all know, children have a fundamental design flaw \u2013 they just won\u2019t stop growing. For years we\u2019ve come no closer to solving this problem. Buy your daughter a bike that\u2019s far too big for her, and then keep it until her knees are starting to bump into her elbows, but that won\u2019t endear her to cycling. Buy her a plastic supermarket bike for \u00a340, and it\u2019ll fall apart within weeks and she\u2019ll go off it and start begging for a pony. Simon Evans decided to do something about this. After cycling round the world in his twenties, the Irish structural engineer got a job in his local bike shop to wait out the recession, and quickly noticed the popularity of balance bikes. \u201cWe had a couple of them on the shop floor, and you\u2019d be selling a racer to Mum or Dad, and the kid would just get on a balance bike and start zooming around,\u201d he recalls. So the poor parent would leave the shop with a balance bike they hadn\u2019t planned to buy \u2013 and less than a year later they\u2019d be back in to upgrade to one with pedals. \u201cThis [the one with pedals] is actually pretty similar to the balance bike,\u201d thought Evans, as he handed over yet another \u2013 and an idea was born. Last month saw the launch of the LittleBig \u2013 an extendable bike designed to suit children between the ages of two and seven, during which time most would end up growing into and out of three different bikes.     LittleBig bikes in balance and pedal bike mode. Photograph: gerry grace/PR    The LittleBig starts off as a balance bike \u2013 and then the rear of the frame niftily rotates, Transformers-style, turning it into a bigger balance bike, with a higher saddle and a longer handlebar reach. And a year or so later, once your child has learned to stay upright, you can attach pedals, and send them off to Alpe d\u2019Huez. Okay, perhaps that\u2019s a bit ambitious for a seven-year-old (unless they\u2019re the protagonist of Alastair Humphreys\u2019 book The Boy Who Biked The World). But Evans, whose own love of cycling evolved from afternoons spent riding his bike around the lanes of Greystones in County Wicklow with his friends, is determined that his invention will give children the best possible cycling start in life. The LittleBig has a pretty high spec for a children\u2019s bike \u2013 the frame\u2019s heat-treated aluminium, the forks are high-tensile steel, and all the moving parts are designed to last. Evans checked out several different factories in Taiwan and China before finding one that could produce the bikes to the quality he required, while also keeping the price low enough that people would actually want to buy them (it costs \u20ac195 (\u00a3154)). The result is a robust machine that\u2019ll stand up to whatever punishment your little angel \u2013 and all of his younger siblings \u2013 will be able to inflict on it. And when your brood have finally grown out of it, it should still be good to sell, or to pass on to another family. The only tiny drawback, I suppose, is that your offspring will have a slightly shorter list of childhood bikes to reminisce over on their future club runs. \u2022 Emily Chappell is a freelance travel writer"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/dec/07/apple-campus-2-the-greenest-building-on-the-planet", "publicationDate": "2014-12-07T12:00:10Z", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Environment", "Apple", "Tim Cook"], "sentences": ["Or the YS Sun Green Building Research Center in Taiwan, which is alleged to be the \u201cworld\u2019s greenest building\u201d?", "The best energy-efficiency performer profiled by Yudelson and Meyer is the YS Sun Green Building Research Center at National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan."], "title": "Apple Campus 2: the greenest building on the planet?", "article": "Jerry Yudelson, president of the Portland, Oregon-based Green Building Initiative, likens sustainable architecture to sex. \u201cIt\u2019s all about performance, not promise. Show me your numbers,\u201d Yudelson says.  A few years ago, Yudelson, together with German architecture critic and professor Ulf Meyer, asked hundreds of owners of the highest-rated new green buildings around the globe to reveal their actual performance data. Their request included details on measured energy and water use, which they would compare with other buildings. Perhaps embarrassed that performance might not live up to promises, a lot of building owners propositioned by Yudelson and Meyer demured. But some did not. The results are presented in their book The World\u2019s Greenest Buildings, published in 2013.  \u201cWe wanted to show that high levels of energy and water efficiency and high levels of aesthetics are not incompatible. Sort of like a beauty queen who can do higher math,\u201d Yudelson says. In addition to providing examples of elegantly designed sustainable buildings, the book is a convenient reference for fact-checking the rising number of claims by building owners and architects worldwide that their green buildings are the greenest of all. In the most recent and high-profile boast, Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the recent Climate Week conference in New York: \u201cWe are building a new headquarters that will, I think, be the greenest building on the planet.\u201d But will the actual performance of Apple Campus 2 \u2013 with its futuristic solar-powered, spaceship-like main building \u2013 match its promise? Will the campus at Cupertino, California, due to open in 2016, be more sustainable than the Bullitt Center in Seattle, which stakes its claim to the title \u201cgreenest commercial building in the world\u201d? Or the YS Sun Green Building Research Center in Taiwan, which is alleged to be the \u201cworld\u2019s greenest building\u201d? Or how about One Angel Square in Manchester, England, \u201cthe world\u2019s most environmentally friendly building\u201d? There are also NuOffice in Munich, Germany, \u201cthe most efficient and most sustainable office building in the world\u201d; Powerhouse Kj\u00f8rbo in Norway, \u201cworld\u2019s most environmentally-friendly office building\u201d; and The Crystal in London, which is more modestly advertised as \u201cone of the world\u2019s greenest buildings\u201d.  As Yudelson says: show me your numbers. Apple Campus 2: green but not \u2018greenest on planet\u2019 While Apple is known for being secretive at times, the iconic Silicon Valley tech giant actually has released a ton of detail about Apple Campus 2. In accordance with California environmental laws, the company produced a 650-page environmental impact report on the project, which the city of Cupertino approved last year. It details everything from Apple\u2019s strategy to power the entire campus with 100% renewable energy and its promises to plant at least 7,000 new trees and use recycled materials. For example, Apple projects its maximum energy use across the entire 5.9m sq ft (548,000 sq meters) campus \u2013 including office spaces, research centers, parking structures and other buildings \u2013 to be around 142,000,000 kilowatt-hours per year. Based on the total area of all the buildings on site, Apple Campus 2 will have an energy use intensity of about 257 kWh per sq meter per year. That easily beats typical office buildings in the United States, which use around 500 kWh per sq meter a year. It even beats more comparable facilities with energy-intensive research labs, such as the Center for Health and Healing at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, a highly rated green building. But, technically speaking, Apple Campus 2 will be far from the greenest building on the planet, at least in terms of energy efficiency. In fact, there are 41 buildings profiled in Yudelson and Meyer\u2019s book that beat it. Even if its actual energy use turns out to be significantly lower \u2013 say, 200 kWh per sq meter per year, or even 100 kWh per sq meter per year \u2013 Apple Campus 2 would still trail numerous commercial buildings already populated and producing actual performance data. The greenest of all? The best energy-efficiency performer profiled by Yudelson and Meyer is the YS Sun Green Building Research Center at National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan. Colloquially known as the Magic School of Green Technology, it uses just 40.43 kWh per sq meter annually. However, the Bullitt Center, which was completed in 2013, after Yudelson and Meyer finished their research, is an even deeper shade of green \u2013 possibly the deepest. That building, which is nestled into Seattle\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood, used only about 32 kWh per sq meter in its first full year of operation. On top of that, thanks to low energy use coupled with a large rooftop solar array, the building actually produces much more electricity than it consumes. \u201cCurrently, we produce 70% more than we consume,\u201d says Denis Hayes, president of the Bullitt Foundation and Earth Day founder. \u201cWhen all our tenants are fully staffed and we have settled into normalcy, I think the stable surplus in a normal year will be 20% to 30%.\u201d Producing more electricity from rooftop solar than it consumes in kilowatt-hours per year, the Bullitt Center is unique even among the greenest buildings in the world. \u201cZero-energy and energy-positive buildings are sexy, and the performance metrics are easy to measure,\u201d says Hayes, who stands by the claim that the Bullitt Center is the greenest office building in the world. \u201cThe admittedly very subjective claim is based upon the Bullitt Center\u2019s position at the cutting edge of so very many aspects of green building performance simultaneously.\u201d But the father of Earth Day certainly won\u2019t be happy unless the Bullitt Center has plenty of competitors.

There were 317 finalised adoptions last year, a fall of 9% on the previous year. The AIHW said this was the smallest number of children adopted since national records began in 1968. It also emerged the proportion of children legally adopted by their carers was the highest in a decade. While the number of most types of adoption declined last year, there were 89 carer adoptions \u2013 in which children are placed with people such as foster parents \u2013 which is three times the number of 10 years ago. Proportionally, carer adoptions accounted for 5% of all adoptions in 2004-05, but last year accounted for 28%. The institute said the rise was driven by legal changes in New South Wales which have increased the focus on adoptions by \u201cknown carers\u201d. A spokesman for the AIHW, Tim Beard, told Guardian Australia there was a \u201cgood chance\u201d the numbers would increase further, because the data covered finalised adoptions and the reforms have been in place for only about 18 months. \u201cNSW has kind of taken the lead on this but other states and territories are certainly considering that as an option, as a path to go down as well, so we may see a flow-through,\u201d Beard said. The report showed that almost all local adoptions were by registered married couples, although only the Northern Territory has that as a legal requirement. Just 1% of adoptive mothers in 2013-14 were under 30. Ages among birth mothers who placed their child for local adoption in Australia ranged from 15 to 44, and the median age, 24, was almost seven years younger than the average birth age for all women in 2012. Almost four in five mothers who adopted a child from another country were over 40. The number of finalised inter-country adoptions dropped from 129 in 2012-13 to 114 in 2013-14. The most common countries of origin were Taiwan, the Philippines and South Korea. The prime minister last year pledged to make it easier for people to adopt children from overseas. Should he be successful, Beard predicted the number of inter-county adoptions would increase, but not in the short term because the process took several years. Processing times are between a median of three years in Taiwan to almost eight years in China. Regarding Tony Abbott\u2019s pledge, Beard said: \u201cIt all depends on the detail behind that policy change and whether the streamlining can be put on the ground effectively.\u201d Among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, none of the seven adoptions in the past year fulfilled the governing principle of giving preference to extended family first, followed by the child\u2019s Indigenous community, then other Indigenous Australians when approving adoptions.  \u201cWhere these options are not available or appropriate, Indigenous children may be adopted by other families,\u201d the report said. Few Indigenous children are adopted, making it difficult to determine a trend, the AIHW said, but of the 49 adoptions since 2003, 24 children were placed with non-Indigenous families. Beard said the low numbers were due to the rarity of an Indigenous child being formally and legally adopted as opposed to placed in an out-of-home care arrangement. \u201cA lot of that is because the Indigenous placement principle \u2026 in every jurisdiction of Australia basically mandates states and territories to look very carefully and to place a child within the child\u2019s family or kin, or another Indigenous family as a first priority,\u201d he said. \u201cThe picture that reads to me is that Indigenous young people are being placed into relative kinship care arrangements or foster care arrangements within Indigenous communities rather than taking the quite dramatic legal step of being adopted by another family.\u201d A report from the AIHW in July revealed Indigenous children were more than 10 times more likely to be taken from parents and placed in care than non-Indigenous children. The rate is higher in every jurisdiction in the country. Of those taken from their parents, 68% of children were placed with relatives or kin, other Indigenous caregivers or in Indigenous residential care, in line with the principle.

Some of his friends in Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong were convinced that the mainland was listening. \u201cThere are voices,\u201d Shum said, \u201cof people who are speaking Mandarin.\u201d Many activists in the region have long assumed that Beijing keeps tabs on them. But the members of a new generation \u2013 who have grown up sharing every hope and feeling via the internet \u2013 are realising that they may be monitored. And they are coming under increased scrutiny both online and on the streets of the city, because of the Umbrella Movement. After police cleared most of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protesters on Thursday, after more than two months of occupation, their thoughts are turning to what lies ahead. Realising that their involvement may have made them likely targets, some young demonstrators are growing nervous about their future. Some students fret that they, like some peers of late, may be barred from travelling to the mainland. If such restrictions persist, their job prospects could be greatly harmed. Security experts have little doubt that authorities are spying on democracy activists. \u201cIf you\u2019re using a cellphone or landline in Hong Kong and you\u2019re one of the protesters, you should absolutely expect that your phone calls are being listened to by the Chinese authorities,\u201d said Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of CrowdStrike \u2013 a US-based cybersecurity company. \u201cI would advise them to be\u00a0paranoid.\u201d For the past two months, Hong Kong police have routinely trained cameras on demonstrators and crowds gathering on pavements near occupation sites. \u201cThey want to find every single protester after all this is finished,\u201d Angus Chan, a 23-year-old financial consultant who wore a camouflage-printed bandana over his nose and mouth, said. As he spoke he was staring at an officer aiming a camera in his direction in Mong Kok, near what had been a large protest camp. \u201cThis is why I\u2019m wearing a mask.\u201d The city\u2019s police force says it has filmed public events since 2006. An email from its public relations branch said: \u201cIt is reasonable and lawful for police to take evidence by video-filming those who are suspected to have violated the law.\u201d However, wearing a surgical mask in public doesn\u2019t protect your identity if you\u2019re tweeting your hate for the regime. \u201cThey still have some idea that because they are students, the communist party won\u2019t do something serious to them,\u201d said Alvin Cheng, a 27-year-old protester who attends an Australian university. \u201cI think some of the students are not well prepared to fight against the communist party.\u201d Hong Kong enjoys far greater freedoms than the mainland, where activists, rights lawyers and dissidents are routinely rounded up for questioning and detention. A growing number have been jailed in recent months. Human rights lawyers and longtime activists in Hong Kong say they have long presumed that the government has been tracking them, especially by tapping their phones. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure mine\u2019s been monitored, despite my phone [being] covered by professional privilege,\u201d said solicitor Michael Vidler, who is representing several of the arrested democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Within one hour of securing the release of teen protester Joshua Wong after the youth\u2019s arrest in September, Vidler said he lost all of his WhatsApp messages \u2013 something that\u2019s never happened before or since. Question for protesters include whether monitoring is being done by the Hong Kong government, the extent of Beijing\u2019s part, and how much information they share. Alperovitch said his company had found at least one spy ring with ties to the Chinese government that had infiltrated the computer networks of democracy protesters and the pro-democracy Civic Party. The ring \u2013 nicknamed Deep Panda by Alperovitch \u2013 has sent text messages that appear to be from friends but contain malware. When a message is opened, spyware is installed on the phone. \u201cIt could grab their contact list, eavesdrop on their phones and steal emails, all covertly,\u201d Alperovitch said. Several pro-democracy supporters have had personal emails and files leaked to media. Jimmy Lai, founder of Next Media, a publishing company that has given generous contributions to democracy groups, has been a frequent target. Beijing says it opposes hacking and is the largest victim of such attacks. A Foreign Ministry spokesman responded to earlier claims of hacking by Deep Panda from CrowdStrike by saying: \u201cSome US internet security firms turn a blind eye to the threat posed by the US to other countries through the internet and are bent on stirring things up by constantly talking about \u2018China Internet Threat\u2019. The so-called evidence they produce is untenable and not worth commenting on.\u201d Whoever is behind the online attacks, activists fear there could be real and immediate consequences for their protest actions. Since 7 November, the mainland\u2019s border patrol has denied entry to at least nine Hong Kong residents with no criminal records, including student leaders who wanted to press their case for democratic elections, lawmaker Cyd Ho said at a public hearing on 3 December. Authorities have cited student activities that violated national security or affected national diplomacy, as well as \u201ccontravention of the relevant rules\u201d, she said. At the hearing, Hong Kong\u2019s secretary for security, Lai Tung-kwok, denied that the government had been compiling blacklists of social activists and passing those to mainland authorities.

The house has undergone some modifications over the years - the elevated roof, for example is, I think, a late addition. I had wanted for so long to take him on a tour of the area where he grew up, and one Saturday earlier this year I took him on a journey back in time. We spent a day walking the backstreets of Dublin where he played as a boy and I was amazed by the number of dwellings in the area the family had occupied over the years. \u201cPeople moved around the city all the time then\u201d, he told me. \u201cFew could afford their own homes, so many people rented.

He remembers the addresses of all the houses he subsequently lived in during his childhood, but I stopped counting after we visited dwelling number five. He assures me the family never moved because they were skipping the rent, rather it was just what many people did in those days - always in search of a better home. While I found our day together incredibly moving and loaded, regretfully, with so many unspoken sentiments, he remained clear-eyed and unsentimental throughout, and possessed of forensic recall.

Just weeks later, a new Chancellor of Germany made his own first appearance 635 miles away in Berlin: Adolf Hitler. I was fortunate to grow up in a village surrounded by many relations which included all four grandparents, but unfortunate to be born as the storm clouds of war in Europe were gathering. Cooperative Terrace was a row of 27 two-up, two-down brick-built homes with slate roofs, a garden to the south-facing front and a walled back-yard to the rear which housed coal-house, outside lavatory and shed with corrugated iron roof. There was no bath-room, no W.C., no running hot water, no central heating. The house belonged to a relative and I believe the rent was 5 shillings per week. The entrance through the front door from the garden path led, via a small bratticed porch which was curtained off to keep out draughts, into a living room which served as lounge and dining area. Furniture consisted a substantial and stylish dark oak dining table, chairs and sideboard, a settee, two arm-chairs and a couple of home-made &#39;crackets&#39; or stools. There was also a piano. My mother had played the piano in the cinema when movies were still silent. In the centre of the west wall was a coal-fired kitchen range which embraced a fire, oven, hot water boiler and, above it, a mantlepiece with clock, ornaments, photographs and a letter-rack with hooks at each end to accommodate towels and, as I was to discover, much later, the dreaded &#39;tawse&#39; - a leather &#39;cat-o-nine-tails&#39; which threatened to be taken down and used whenever my father considered we deserved to be chastised! A fender round the hearth had &#39;box-seats&#39; built in at each end. These had a &#39;lid&#39; and they contained fire-wood or shoes and slippers. A short passage, at the foot of the stairs, led into the &#39;back-kitchen&#39; which had boiler in a brick surround (for washing clothes), a wash-basin &amp; cold water-tap, table, and set of drawers. From it led a large &#39;pantry&#39; with many shelves which stored food in its many forms. Later, at the onset of the war, part of the pantry was given a brick and concrete lining which served as our indoor air-raid shelter. Upstairs and separated by a short landing were the two bed-rooms. My brother and I slept in the one which overlooked the yard and you can see the window in the second photograph. The garden at the front was rather pretty consisting of a lawn with flower borders down the paths. Near the window facing the garden, Dad had constructed an aerial of sorts for our D.C. wireless set. The short brick wall at the far end of the garden had wrought-iron railings which were taken away for the War Effort in 1940. From 1939, all windows were taped, first with paper crosses, and then, later, with cloth mesh to prevent the glass shattering in a raid. Warning of these consisted of short blasts on the colliery buzzer. A long blast gave the &#39;All-clear&#39;. My father, who was serving with the army in France, was killed on the retreat to Dunkirk in May 1940. My mother, who was only 31 at the time, married again three years later and at the age of 10 I left the house I was born in for a new life.

As far as I can remember most coking coal went by train to the steel mills in Luxemburg and France ... Our home was close to the surrounding brick wall of the pit. We played soccer there ,marking the goal with chalk on the wall. To start with, we even played with an inflated and dried pig\u2019s bladder. Compared to todays life it was simple and there were a lot of shortcomings, however I did not miss anything, probably because I did not know amu better. We had a \u2018miner\u2019s cow\u2019 - a pig in a hog and slaughtering time was a big feast with the neighbors and I was allowed to stir the blood to make black pudding. Everybody had plenty of beer and schnapps (the drink for miners to get the coal dust out of the lungs). We lived leeward of the pit and the coking plant sent fumes from times to time across the miners quarter. The quarter is now revived and my uncle still lives there. In my family, my grandfather, his three sons and other family members and of course numerous friends all worked at the pit. The coal mine was the umbilical cord of the city. We had simple food like potato pancake with milk soup (I still like it) but we got sufficient coal from the mine for heating in our coal stove. Even coal was sold on the \u2018black\u2019 to make a living. We were out all day strolling around in the streets (still unpaved that time) with friends and played in the bushes with sling shots. Very often we went up to a crossing bridge over the mine area where we could watch the coking process and stay in the fumes when the train with the smoldering coking coal passed below. My father, who was British POW in Italy and where he learnt English, was working very hard but at weekends festivities happened very often. The white collars lived on the other, clean-side, of the mine. I was the eldest of three sons and my father tried everything to get me into the middle school, which he managed. It was a gap between societies, I was the only pupil in my class from a workers family. Sometimes I felt resentment when I went to my school friends home. However, eventually I graduated.\u201d Sue Nicholson was born in County Durham in 1952           50s life in a Durham village    Coal fire, outside toilet (no fancy flush, either) and a tin bath in front of the fire - first memories of the house I lived in until I was 21.  The third bedroom was later converted into a bathroom but as a tot I was terrified to go up the yard at night to the smelly earth closet - a hand would surely grab me from below before I\u2019d managed to sort myself with the small, ripped squares of Radio Times (no Andrex in the 50s)! These were the days of a weekly bath (shared before the advent of the bathroom) and hair wash, deep frost on the insides of windows in winter, your breath steaming in the cold outside bed clothes and a coal fire in just one room, unless some was ill or, later, when I had homework.  The coal shed was topped up with a weekly delivery, the earth closet cleaned on the same schedule. After the range was taken out of the living room the scullery came into its own with my mum cooking on a Baby Belling and Monday wash day modernised with a single tub washer (with built-in mangle) and a separate spin drier. There was a wonderful walk-in pantry but only the rich had a fridge, or TV.  Everyone hung their washing across the back lane and anger descended on anyone who tried negotiate the street with any sort of vehicle which might soil newly washed sheets.  No play out there on washdays, either. Wallpaper was only just becoming available after WW2 and my mum was an ace decorator, never happier when she was ripping smoke stained paper off the living room and putting up new.  She was especially proud of the latest trend - a feature wall! No one locked their doors, visitors walked straight in with a \u2018hello\u2019 and my mum and neighbour would bang on the adjoining living room wall to signify the kettle was on for a morning cuppa.

My earliest memories are of me walking, on a squeaky wooden floor, to my parents bedroom. I felt this explosion of joy, a child\u2019s ecstasy as I came to see my parents, who were groggy in bed. The joy reminded me of gum balls we got at a nearby pharmacy, which I chewed while sitting on my dad\u2019s shoulders. (He later told me that a depressed woman observed our joyful relationship and sought him out to be his psychiatrist.) We did not get a TV until about 1959, right before we moved to the suburbs, with my parents both credentialed and my mom with a good job as medical librarian at the AMA. For me, the apartment and Hyde Park were magical places. I felt secure and loved, with absolutely marvelous places to explore within walking distance. Every Saturday, my mom and I went to the Museum of Science and Industry, which was free to enter at that time; I got a Matchbox car each time we went. It had this amazing technology and science on display, like a heart you could walk into and a display of human fetuses in bottles from inception to birth. I remember once we waited for it to open in an entrance hall with silver metal walls, reflecting the sounds of speech so that it was a choppy, rhythmic hum, which I tried to mimic as I thought every one else was mumbling that way. It was also near The Point on Lake Michigan, which had these loud, wierdly menacing radars that revolved like something out of science fiction. THere was also a museum, in a house, of medieval armor that I loved to visit (the collection is now in the Art Institute).\u201d Nora Bermingham was born in Dublin in 1970           My entire family (11 of us) and the neighbours   Dublin won the All Ireland in 1974 (or maybe 76) and the cup was magically brought to our house in Drimnagh, Dublin.

Where I greased the walls with grubby hands, scratched the staircase wood with sharp pens, left mud footprints on the hall carpet. Where I still avoid hearing &quot;Wear your shoes!&quot; &quot;Wash your hands!&quot; and &quot;Time for bath!&quot; A room where my window invited spring breeze. A scent of paddy fields and apple orchards called me out, Mum&#39;s kitchen aromas whipped up hunger and the smell of ink on lined paper bound me to my little desk. Dad chopping up wood for the winter, annoying little sparrows in the window grille, strong wind rustling in the willow tree outside my room \u2013 these sounds drove me crazy. Where the world was not a big globe, but four square rooms. Where society was Mum and Dad. Where friend was Sister. Where every guest was a wonder to explore. A successful birthday was five presents. Where books were internet. Sunday movie was television. Mum&#39;s wooden clothes-beater was the cricket bat. A paper ball was shuttlecock. Holidays were running to the river, hiding in the paddy stalks, catching fish in the pond, stealing apples from the orchard, battling flies. There was a god in the house. With a serious face, in a dark corner, next to the kitchen. Every time my hand went to the larder, when no one was around, god&#39;s eyes were on me. My hand withdrew every time. As I outgrew my bed and my room, the world outside my home became visible, as if a mist had lifted off it. The world outside was enchanting, bigger, more beautiful and it had no gods. I stepped out of my home. A few years later, a fire ate my home. It was set on fire. It burnt down to ashes. My stamps, coins and birthday cards inside the blue plastic box burnt down. So did the little books, the grubby stained walls, the scratched wooden staircase, the silly cricket bats and badminton rackets. I never went back. The poplar trees must be taller in the garden. The willow outside my window would still be making annoying noises. And the sparrows. But no more Mum&#39;s cooking, Dad&#39;s log chopping. I wonder if the serious faced god still hides in that dark corner next to the kitchen? My wife bought me a canvas and a box of oil paints.The house in the picture is my home in Kashmir, which I painted on the day I heard that it was burnt down. Which I had fled from.

He is the first Chinese Nobel laureate who is neither in exile nor in jail, and discussion of his merits defaulted to his relationship with the regime and the vexed question of whether official approval was compatible with literary excellence. His critics argued that his credibility suffered by comparison with others whose opposition was more explicitly embedded in the contest of values and moral claims between liberty and communism, and the Chinese government\u2019s evident delight at the prize did nothing to help. It is a pity for those who might otherwise enjoy his work that he was put on one side of a line that he himself had not chosen to draw. A reader who brings an open mind to Frog, the novel first published in Chinese in 2009, awarded the Mao Dun literary prize in 2011 and now impeccably translated into English by Howard Goldblatt, will discover a subtle if occasionally baggy text that does not slot easily into a political binary. Mo Yan, which means \u201cDon\u2019t speak\u201d, is the pen name of Guan Moye, the son of a well-to-do landowning family from\u00a0Shandong province in northeast China. The novel is set, like much of his work, in his real-life home county of Gaomi. Why the title Frog? The answer is a\u00a0meandering connection Mo Yan makes between human sperm, early stage embryos, tadpoles and bullfrogs that is woven through a novel concerned primarily with the importance of love and life. The ostensible subject is the life story of the author\u2019s aunt, known as Gugu, which is told through a series of letters to a celebrated but unidentified Japanese writer, in which the narrator declares his intention to write a play about Gugu. The short play is finally completed and appended to the novel. Gugu is 70 when the story opens with the first letter. The daughter of a\u00a0famous doctor, her life spans the Japanese occupation of China, the victory of the Communist party in 1949, the hunger and violent political upheavals of the first 30 years of communist rule and, finally, the lurch to a peculiarly rampant form of state-directed capitalism and the social forces it unleashes. Some villagers grow rich; others sink into destitution. Gugu trains as a midwife while still a\u00a0charismatic and heroic teenager, and begins her career by dispatching the ignorant and superstitious old women who, with fatal effects, have hitherto attended village births. Gugu\u2019s reputation spreads quickly as she delivers children through the ravages of famine and political upheaval. (One cohort is known as the \u201csweet potato\u201d generation for the fact that their appearance marks a return to fertility after the mass starvation of the Great Leap Forward.) Her golden career falters, however, when her glamorous fiance, an airforce pilot, defects to Taiwan. Narrowly escaping disgrace as a conspirator in his treason, Gugu throws herself with renewed and implacable zeal into the state\u2019s one-child policy. The beloved midwife becomes hated state abortionist, hunting down and forcibly terminating unlicensed pregnancies. Many expectant mothers and thousands of unborn children die horribly. When China begins its economic transformation, only the poor remain caught by the rules. The rich can afford to pay the\u00a0fines; the poor have to cheat. The policy stays in place, one character explains, because it allows the state to\u00a0collect fines. The cast of villagers faces the absurdities and cruelties inflicted on\u00a0them by life, the party and each other with a comic fatalism reminiscent of Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek\u2019s The Good Soldier Svejk. Most are resigned to the unavoidable necessity of obeying orders, however ludicrous and cruel their effects might be, since the consequences of defiance, vividly described in the novel, are extreme. Mo Yan\u2019s use of magic and fable has inspired comparisons to Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. For his characters the village bestiary of sprites and demons are everyday companions. His villagers are\u00a0all but immune to ideology, and throughout the one-child policy they continue to believe that, as the philosopher Mencius puts it, the worst form of lack of filial piety is the failure to produce an heir. They are everyman, long-suffering and, on the whole, well disposed towards their fellow human beings. They have no great expectation of happiness, and in that they are generally proved right. \u2022 Isabel Hilton is the editor of chinadialogue.net.

Now, they come with sonar and satellite buoys attached, which can tell the captain of a modern fishing vessel exactly what\u2019s swimming underneath the objects from thousands of kilometers away.  In other words, FADs no longer simply complement a captain\u2019s fish finding abilities. For many boats, they have become the prime tool in locating the fish. Mother Nature is no longer needed.    \u200bIt\u2019s an arms race.  Bubba Cook, WWF     Before steaming towards a FAD to set a purse seine net, a vessel\u2019s captain will already have an estimate on the biomass of fish held by the device, the particular species, and even the size of the fish \u2013 all picked up by sonar and transmitted via satellite. As the use of FADs is increasing, conservation groups say existing measures to lower the impact aren\u2019t working. Tech-equipped FADs are already playing a big role in the decimation of the bigeye tuna stock \u2013 a lucrative species sought in sushi restaurants from America to Europe to Asia \u2013 while also threatening the relatively healthy skipjack and yellowfin tunas, experts say. \u201cIt\u2019s an arms race,\u201d says Bubba Cook, Pacific tuna program manager at WWF, formerly the World Wildlife Fund. \u201cThe industry is spending a lot less time and a lot less money to track down the fish and actually conduct the fishing then they were 15 years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cIn doing so, they are able to catch a lot more fish in a whole less time\u2026 that increase in efficiency is what\u2019s driving the population of fish down.\u201d The battle\u2019s epicenter One particularly productive portion of the Pacific Ocean accounts for roughly 50% of global canned tuna supply. Stretching over 14.8m square kilometers of ocean, eight neighboring small Pacific Island states have joined forces through an arrangement called the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) to manage their abundant skipjack stocks.     Bigeye tuna can\u2019t sustain the FAD onslaught. Photograph: Lauren Packard/flickr    PNA waters are home to some of the world\u2019s richest fishing grounds, including a skipjack tuna fishery they estimate to be worth $8bn once the tins have passed through supermarket checkout counters. According to one estimate, 80,000 FADs are being used in PNA waters this year. \u201cThe impact of sonar buoys, as stated by some of the industry players, is it is a game changer,\u201d says Maurice Brownjohn, the PNA\u2019s commercial manager. \u201cWe have examples now where the captain is no longer allowed to know where his FADs are, because someone sits in a control room and says \u2018go here make a set, go there and make a set\u2019. The hunting instinct has gone out of it, and it\u2019s purely a harvesting exercise \u2026 it\u2019s cherry picking.\u201d To regulate fishing, the PNA jointly sells fishing days to distant fishing nations. With 24 hours of fishing costing as much as $12,000 recently, fishing companies are responding with a drive for efficiency, pulling more fish out of the water at faster and faster rates. Urgent action needed to save bigeye tuna Skipjack are believed to be a healthy stock, but there are concerns about whether they can sustain the FAD onslaught. What is known is bigeye tuna can\u2019t. Juvenile bigeye have a habit of joining skipjack at FADs and inadvertently getting caught in the nets. Scientists have recently assessed bigeye stock at 16% of its historic size.  In addition to a need to slash catches in the bigeye longline fishery \u2013 where most of the fish is caught - the broader fishing community also recognizes urgent action is needed to regulate FADs to bring bigeye back from the brink.  A four-month ban on FADs already exists in the western and central Pacific, but is seen as ineffective at reducing bigeye mortality by the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation, as well as major environmental NGOs. Failure of political talks in Samoa NGOs want to see more action being taken. However, when it comes to fishing, competing political and commercial interests often see conservation measures fall deep into the abyss.    The urgent need for FAD management is recognized by everyone, from scientists to industry.  Amanda Nickson, Pew Charitable Trusts     Compounding the problem, the small island states and big fishing nations involved in the management of the Pacific\u2019s tuna fisheries can\u2019t agree what to do about them. Earlier this month, leaders from small Pacific island states and delegations from the European Union, China, South Korea, Japan, the US, and Taiwan \u2013 the \u201cdistant water\u201d fishing nations \u2013 failed to agree on stricter conditions for FAD use in the region when they met at the annual meeting of the Westernand Central Pacific Fisheries Commission in Samoa, keeping in place the four-month ban for 2015. The commission\u2019s failure was met with widespread disappointment by Pacific region leaders and NGOs, including Greenpeace, which is calling for an outright ban on FADs. \u201cThe data makes it absolutely clear that FADs have a devastating impact on juvenile bigeye, and unless the WCPFC declares a total ban on FADs, this meeting is just talk,\u201d said Greenpeace\u2019s Lagi Toribau at the WCPFC meeting in Samoa. Conservationists strike back In the absence of more comprehensive FAD management, conservationists and other stakeholders are calling for a resurgence in old-school fishing methods \u2013 the pursuit of free schools of skipjack, the only method recognized as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council.  But when it comes to monitoring, control and surveillance efforts, resource managers are also starting to turn to tech for help. Working with The Pew Charitable Trusts, the PNA is developing a system that uses the same satellite technology used by FADs to track FADs. Eventually, it hopes the system will have the capability to track thousands of FADs floating in PNA waters and monitor each time a purse seiner sets its net on one. Such a system could also help PNA countries lay down the law and follow the example of the United States, which fined Spanish fishing company Albacora SA $5m in 2010 after one of its vessels deployed FADs in US waters without a proper license.  \u201cThe urgent need for FAD management in the western and central Pacific is recognized by everyone, from scientists to industry,\u201d says Amanda Nickson, Pew\u2019s director of global tuna conservation. \u201cIn the face of bigeye\u2019s dramatic population decline in the region, it is inexcusable that there are no requirements for reporting or tracking where FADs are set into the water, how often they are used, and if the objects are ever recovered.\u201d Emmanuel Samoglou is a freelance writer.
