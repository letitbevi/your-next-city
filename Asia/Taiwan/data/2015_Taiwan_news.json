There\u2019s a general misconception that these chewy tapioca pearls are the bubbles \u2013 but they\u2019re not. They\u2019re just the pearls! The bubbles in bubble tea come from the fact that the drink, once prepared, is shaken in a cocktail shaker to produce actual bubbles and make the drink frothy. About 4-5 years ago, bubble tea started making a comeback. During a trip back home to Singapore, I noticed that a new shop that had recently opened was selling two different categories: fresh milk and milk tea. My curiosity was piqued \u2013 if the one was made with fresh milk, what was the milk in the other? I was told that milk tea was usually made with powdered milk. Now, this was around the time when there was that big powdered milk scandal in China, so finding out that that\u2019s what I\u2019d been drinking in my bubble tea all these years was a bit of a shock! I felt cheated \u2026 On my return to the UK, the trend was picking up \u2013 a bunch of new places had opened, but I was disappointed. Everything was so artificial \u2013 the flavours, the colours. I decided the food scene in London deserved better than \u00a33.50 for something bad made with powdered milk, so I spent the next year-and-a-half figuring out a plan. I went on a two-month research trip to Taiwan and learned a lot about the bubble tea industry there, and how supplier-driven it was: everything from the ingredients to the recipes came from the suppliers, and they were naturally averse to change. The shops claimed to be tea specialists, but the tea they used was never freshly made. Instead it was made in vast quantities and reheated, either in kettles or with steam wands. Anyone who drinks tea will tell you that is no way to treat it! In Singapore fresh milk isn\u2019t good \u2013 it has a vanilla flavour, which I\u2019m fairly certain isn\u2019t produced by the cows themselves. But I love British milk. So I decided I wanted to make bubble tea with fresh, organic milk, freshly made tea and natural flavourings. We wanted to cater to eastern as well as western tastes \u2013 which is a slightly tricky balance to strike. Taro milk, for example, or ice honey green tea, are such classic Asian choices, whereas UK customers love ice passion fruit and ice peach tea. We opened on Old Compton St in Soho, London, five months ago. We serve five different categories of drinks: milk (with green or black tea), ice tea (no milk, just fruit flavours), fruity milk (no tea, just milk and fruit flavours), mousse tea (sweet tea with savoury mousse) and \u2013 this one\u2019s slightly out of left-field \u2013 coconut water. We offer almond and soy milk as well as regular cow\u2019s milk. Our tapioca pearls are baked fresh every two hours, and we prepare our own toppings too \u2013 cubes of herbal jelly or egg pudding, balls of popping fruit juice \u2026 We really look after our customers and get excellent feedback. It\u2019s such a good feeling to see someone nodding and smiling over an ice peach tea on a hot day. bijububbletea.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/06/-sp-universal-healthcare-the-affordable-dream-amartya-sen", "publicationDate": "2015-01-06T05:59:04Z", "tags": ["Health", "Global development", "Business", "Society", "Economics", "Healthcare industry", "NHS", "Health policy", "Public services policy"], "sentences": ["There is much evidence of the big contributions that UHC can make in advancing the lives of people, and also (and this is very important) in enhancing economic and social opportunities \u2013 including facilitating the possibility of sustained economic growth (as has been firmly demonstrated in the experience of south-east Asian countries, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and, more recently, China)."], "title": "Universal healthcare: the affordable dream", "article": "Twenty-five hundred years ago, the young Gautama Buddha left his princely home, in the foothills of the Himalayas, in a state of agitation and agony. What was he so distressed about? We learn from his biography that he was moved in particular by seeing the penalties of ill health \u2013 by the sight of mortality (a dead body being taken to cremation), morbidity (a person severely afflicted by illness), and disability (a person reduced and ravaged by unaided old age). Health has been a primary concern of human beings throughout history. It should, therefore, come as no surprise that healthcare for all \u2013 \u201cuniversal healthcare\u201d (UHC) \u2013 has been a highly appealing social objective in most countries in the world, even in those that have not got very far in actually providing it. The usual reason given for not attempting to provide universal healthcare in a country is poverty. The United States, which can certainly afford to provide healthcare at quite a high level for all Americans, is exceptional in terms of the popularity of the view that any kind of public establishment of universal healthcare must somehow involve unacceptable intrusions into private life. There is considerable political complexity in the resistance to UHC in the US, often led by medical business and fed by ideologues who want \u201cthe government to be out of our lives\u201d, and also in the systematic cultivation of a deep suspicion of any kind of national health service, as is standard in Europe (\u201csocialised medicine\u201d is now a term of horror in the US). One of the oddities in the contemporary world is our astonishing failure to make adequate use of policy lessons that can be drawn from the diversity of experiences that the heterogeneous world already provides. There is much evidence of the big contributions that UHC can make in advancing the lives of people, and also (and this is very important) in enhancing economic and social opportunities \u2013 including facilitating the possibility of sustained economic growth (as has been firmly demonstrated in the experience of south-east Asian countries, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and, more recently, China). Further, a number of poor countries have shown, through their pioneering public policies, that basic healthcare for all can be provided at a remarkably good level at very low cost if the society, including the political and intellectual leadership, can get its act together. There are many examples of such success across the world. None of these individual examples are flawless and each country can learn from the experiences of others. Nevertheless, the lessons that can be derived from these pioneering departures provide a solid basis for the presumption that, in general, the provision of universal healthcare is an achievable goal even in the poorer countries. An Uncertain Glory: India and its Contradictions, my book written jointly with Jean Dr\u00e8ze, discusses how the country\u2019s predominantly messy healthcare system can be vastly improved by learning lessons from high-performing nations abroad, and also from the contrasting performances of different states within India that have pursued different health policies.    Thailand\u2019s rise in life expectancy \u2013 now more than 74 years at birth \u2013 is a major achievement for a poor country    *** Over the last three decades various studies have investigated the experiences of countries where effective healthcare is provided at low cost to the bulk of the population. The places that first received detailed attention included China, Sri Lanka, Costa Rica, Cuba and the Indian state of Kerala. Since then examples of successful UHC \u2013 or something close to that \u2013 have expanded, and have been critically scrutinised by health experts and empirical economists. Good results of universal care without bankrupting the economy \u2013 in fact quite the opposite \u2013 can be seen in the experience of many other countries. This includes the remarkable achievements of Thailand, which has had for the last decade and a half a powerful political commitment to providing inexpensive, reliable healthcare for all. Thailand\u2019s experience in universal healthcare is exemplary, both in advancing health achievements across the board and in reducing inequalities between classes and regions. Prior to the introduction of UHC in 2001, there was reasonably good insurance coverage for about a quarter of the population. This privileged group included well-placed government servants, who qualified for a civil service medical benefit scheme, and employees in the privately owned organised sector, which had a mandatory social security scheme from 1990 onwards, and received some government subsidy. In the 1990s some further schemes of government subsidy did emerge, however they proved woefully inadequate. The bulk of the population had to continue to rely largely on out-of-pocket payments for medical care. However, in 2001 the government introduced a \u201c30 baht universal coverage programme\u201d that, for the first time, covered all the population, with a guarantee that a patient would not have to pay more than 30 baht (about 60p) per visit for medical care (there is exemption for all charges for the poorer sections \u2013 about a quarter \u2013 of the population). The result of universal health coverage in Thailand has been a significant fall in mortality (particularly infant and child mortality, with infant mortality as low as 11 per 1,000) and a remarkable rise in life expectancy, which is now more than 74 years at birth \u2013 major achievements for a poor country. There has also been an astonishing removal of historic disparities in infant mortality between the poorer and richer regions of Thailand; so much so that Thailand\u2019s low infant mortality rate is now shared by the poorer and richer parts of the country. There are also powerful lessons to learn from what has been achieved in Rwanda, where health gains from universal coverage have been astonishingly rapid. Devastated by genocide in 1994, the country has rebuilt itself and established an inclusive health system for all with equity-oriented national policies focusing on social cohesion and people-centred development. Premature mortality has fallen sharply and life expectancy has actually doubled since the mid-1990s. Following pilot experiments in three districts with community-based health insurance and performance-based financing systems, the health coverage was scaled up to cover the whole nation in 2004 and 2005. As the Rwandan minister of health Agnes Binagwaho, the US medical anthropologist Paul Farmer and their co-authors discuss in Rwanda 20 Years on: Investing in Life, a paper published in the Lancet in July 2014: \u201cInvesting in health has stimulated shared economic growth as citizens live longer and with greater capacity to pursue the lives they value.\u201d     A doctor explains treatment procedure to a patient in Butare, Rwanda. Photograph: David Evans/National Geographic/Getty Images    The experiences of many other countries also offer good lessons, from Brazil and Mexico (which have recently implemented UHC with reasonable success) to Bangladesh and the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu (with progress towards the universal coverage that has already been achieved by Kerala). Bangladesh\u2019s progress, which has been rapid, makes clear the effectiveness of giving a significant role to women in the delivery of healthcare and education, combined with the part played by women employees in spreading knowledge about effective family planning (Bangladesh\u2019s fertility rate has fallen sharply from being well above five children per couple to 2.2 \u2013 quite close to the replacement level of 2.1). To separate out another empirically observed influence, Tamil Nadu shows the rewards of having efficiently run public services for all, even when the services on offer may be relatively meagre. The population of Tamil Nadu has greatly benefited, for example, from its splendidly run mid-day meal service in schools and from its extensive system of nutrition and healthcare of pre-school children. The message that striking rewards can be reaped from serious attempts at instituting \u2013 or even moving towards \u2013 universal healthcare is hard to miss. The critical ingredients of success that have emerged from these studies appear to include a firm political commitment to the provision of universal healthcare, running workable elementary healthcare and preventive services covering as much of the population as possible, paying serious attention to good administration in healthcare and ancillary public services and arranging effective school education for all. Perhaps most importantly, it means involving women in the delivery of health and education in a much larger way than is usual in the developing world. *** The question can, however, be asked: how does universal healthcare become affordable in poor countries? Indeed, how has UHC been afforded in those countries or states that have run against the widespread and entrenched belief that a poor country must first grow rich before it is able to meet the costs of healthcare for all? The alleged common-sense argument that if a country is poor it cannot provide UHC is, however, based on crude and faulty economic reasoning. The first \u2013 and perhaps the most important \u2013 factor overlooked by the naysayers is the fact that at a basic level healthcare is a very labour-intensive activity, and in a poor country wages are low. A poor country may have less money to spend on healthcare, but it also needs to spend less to provide the same labour-intensive services (far less than what a richer \u2013 and higher-wage \u2013 economy would have to pay). Not to take into account the implications of large wage differences is a gross oversight that distorts the discussion of the affordability of labour-intensive activities such as healthcare and education in low-wage economies. Second, how much healthcare can be provided to all may well depend on the country\u2019s economic means, but whatever is affordable within a country\u2019s means can still be more effectively and more equitably provided through universal coverage. Given the hugely unequal distribution of incomes in many economies, there can be serious inefficiency as well as unfairness in leaving the distribution of healthcare entirely to people\u2019s respective abilities to buy medical services. UHC can bring about not only greater equity, but also much larger overall health achievement for the nation, since the remedying of many of the most easily curable diseases and the prevention of readily avoidable ailments get left out under the out-of-pocket system, because of the inability of the poor to afford even very elementary healthcare and medical attention. It is also worth noting here, as European examples richly illustrate, that providing UHC is compatible with allowing the purchase of extra services for the especially affluent (or those with extra health insurance), and the demands of UHC must be distinguished from the ethics of aiming at complete equality. This is not to deny that remedying inequality as much as possible is an important value \u2013 a subject on which I have written over many decades. Reduction of economic and social inequality also has instrumental relevance for good health. Definitive evidence of this is provided in the work of Michael Marmot, Richard Wilkinson and others on the \u201csocial determinants of health\u201d, showing that gross inequalities harm the health of the underdogs of society, both by undermining their lifestyles and by making them prone to harmful behaviour patterns, such as smoking and excessive drinking. Nevertheless, the ethics of universal health coverage have to be distinguished from the value of eliminating inequalities in general, which would demand much more radical economic and social changes than UHC requires. Healthcare for all can be implemented with comparative ease, and it would be a shame to delay its achievement until such time as it can be combined with the more complex and difficult objective of eliminating all inequality. Third, many medical and health services are shared, rather than being exclusively used by each individual separately. For example, an epidemiological intervention reaches many people who live in the same neighbourhood, rather than only one person at a time. Healthcare, thus, has strong components of what in economics is called a \u201ccollective good,\u201d which typically is very inefficiently allocated by the pure market system, as has been extensively discussed by economists such as Paul Samuelson. Covering more people together can sometimes cost less than covering a smaller number individually. Fourth, many diseases are infectious. Universal coverage prevents their spread and cuts costs through better epidemiological care. This point, as applied to individual regions, has been recognised for a very long time. The conquest of epidemics has, in fact, been achieved by not leaving anyone untreated in regions where the spread of infection is being tackled. The transmission of disease from region to region \u2013 and of course from country to country \u2013 has broadened the force of this argument in recent years.    Had there been effective UHC in the countries of origin of Ebola, the problem could have been eliminated    Right now, the pandemic of Ebola is causing alarm even in parts of the world far away from its place of origin in west Africa. For example, the US has taken many expensive steps to prevent the spread of Ebola within its own borders. Had there been effective UHC in the countries of origin of the disease, this problem could have been mitigated or even eliminated. In addition, therefore, to the local benefits of having UHC in a country, there are global ones as well. The calculation of the ultimate economic costs and benefits of healthcare can be a far more complex process than the universality-deniers would have us believe. *** In the absence of a reasonably well-organised system of public healthcare for all, many people are afflicted by overpriced and inefficient private healthcare. As has been analysed by many economists, most notably Kenneth Arrow, there cannot be a well-informed competitive market equilibrium in the field of medical attention, because of what economists call \u201casymmetric information\u201d. Patients do not typically know what treatment they need for their ailments, or what medicine would work, or even what exactly the doctor is giving to them as a remedy. Unlike in the market for many commodities, such as shirts or umbrellas, the buyer of medical treatment knows far less than what the seller \u2013 the doctor \u2013 does, and this vitiates the efficiency of market competition. This applies to the market for health insurance as well, since insurance companies cannot fully know what patients\u2019 health conditions are. This makes markets for private health insurance inescapably inefficient, even in terms of the narrow logic of market allocation. And there is, in addition, the much bigger problem that private insurance companies, if unrestrained by regulations, have a strong financial interest in excluding patients who are taken to be \u201chigh-risk\u201d. So one way or another, the government has to play an active part in making UHC work. The problem of asymmetric information applies to the delivery of medical services itself. It makes the possibility of exploitation of the relatively ignorant a likely result even when there is plentiful market competition. And when medical personnel are scarce, so that there is not much competition either, it can make the predicament of the buyer of medical treatment even worse. Furthermore, when the provider of healthcare is not himself trained (as is often the case in many countries with deficient health systems), the situation becomes worse still. As a result, in the absence of a well-organised public health system covering all, many patients, denied any alternative, remain vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous individuals who robustly combine crookery and quackery. While such lamentable conditions are seen in a number of countries, there are other countries (or states within countries) that, as has already been discussed, demonstrate the rewards of having a functioning universal public healthcare system \u2013 with better health achievements and also larger development of human capabilities. In some countries \u2013 for example India \u2013 we see both systems operating side by side in different states within the country. A state such as Kerala provides fairly reliable basic healthcare for all through public services \u2013 Kerala pioneered UHC in India several decades ago, through extensive public health services. As the population of Kerala has grown richer \u2013 partly as a result of universal healthcare and near-universal literacy \u2013 many people now choose to pay more and have additional private healthcare. But since these private services have to compete with what the state provides, and have to do even better to justify their charges in a region with widespread medical knowledge and medical opportunity, the quality of private medical services tends also to be better there than where there is no competition from public services and a low level of public education. In contrast, states such as Madhya Pradesh or Uttar Pradesh give plentiful examples of exploitative and inefficient healthcare for the bulk of the population. Not surprisingly, people who live in Kerala live much longer and have a much lower incidence of preventable illnesses than do people from states such as Madhya Pradesh or Uttar Pradesh. A system of universal healthcare also has the advantage that it can focus on vitally needed \u2013 but often ignored \u2013 primary medical attention, and on relatively inexpensive outpatient care when a disease receives early attention. In the absence of systematic care for all, diseases are often allowed to develop, which makes it much more expensive to treat them, often involving inpatient treatment, such as surgery. Thailand\u2019s experience clearly shows how the need for more expensive procedures may go down sharply with fuller coverage of preventive care and early intervention. Good healthcare demands systematic and comprehensive attention, and in the absence of affordable healthcare for all, illnesses become much harder and much more expensive to treat. If the advancement of equity is one of the rewards of well-organised universal healthcare, enhancement of efficiency in medical attention is surely another. *** The case for UHC is often underestimated because of inadequate appreciation of what well-organised and affordable healthcare for all can do to enrich and enhance human lives. It is one thing to accept that the world may not have the resources and the dexterity at this moment to provide the finest of medical care to all, but that is not a reason for eliminating our search for ways of proceeding towards just that, nor a ground for refusing to provide whatever can be easily provided right now for all. In this context it is also necessary to bear in mind an important reminder contained in Paul Farmer\u2019s book Pathologies of Power: Health, Human Rights and the New War on the Poor: \u201cClaims that we live in an era of limited resources fail to mention that these resources happen to be less limited now than ever before in human history.\u201d In addition, we have to take note of the dual role of healthcare in directly making our lives better \u2013 reducing our impoverishment in ways that matter to all human beings \u2013 as well as helping to remove poverty, assessed even in purely economic terms. Reduction of economic poverty occurs partly as a result of the greater productivity of a healthy and educated population, leading to higher wages and larger rewards from more effective work, but also because UHC makes it less likely that vulnerable, uninsured people would be made destitute by medical expenses far beyond their means. Here again, Thailand\u2019s experience shows how penury caused by medical costs can fall rapidly once UHC is established.     Recovering children with mothers in a pediatric malaria ward in Butare. Photograph: David Evans/National Geographic/Getty Images    The mutual support that healthcare and economic development can provide has been brought out very extensively by the results of UHC-oriented policies in south-east Asia, from Japan to Singapore. The complementary nature of health advancement and economic progress is also illustrated in the comparative experiences of different states within India. I remember being admonished 40 years ago, when I spoke in support of Kerala\u2019s efforts to have state-supported healthcare for all. I was firmly told that this strategy could not possibly work, since Kerala was, then, one of the poorest states in India. The thesis of unaffordability was, however, wrongly argued for reasons already discussed. Despite its poverty, Kerala did manage to run an effective UHC programme that contributed greatly to its having, by some margin, the longest life expectancy in India and the lowest rates of infant and child mortality, among its other health accomplishments. But in addition to these so-called \u201csocial achievements\u201d, it was possible to argue even in those early days \u2013 despite scorn from those who were opposed to UHC \u2013 that with the help of a more educated and healthier workforce, Kerala would also be able to grow faster in purely economic terms. After all, there are no influences as strong in raising the productivity of labour as health, education and skill formation \u2013 a foundational connection to which Adam Smith gave much attention. This has actually happened. In fact, the previously poor state of Kerala, with its universal healthcare and universal schooling, now has the highest per capita income among all the states in India. Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh, both of which have made substantial moves towards the provision of education and basic healthcare for all, have both progressed admirably and now belong solidly among the richer Indian states. There is, thus, plenty of evidence that not only does universal healthcare powerfully enhance the health of people, its rewards go well beyond health. There is, indeed, a strong relationship between health and economic performance, and we have every reason to base public policy on a proper understanding of the nature and reach of what is clearly a positive interdependence. There is no mystery in all this given the centrality of health for better lives and for enhancing human capabilities. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter: @gdnlongread"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/07/global-box-office-pk-the-hobbit-big-hero-6-unbroken", "publicationDate": "2015-01-07T14:06:57Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Bollywood", "Liam Neeson", "Religion", "India", "Angelina Jolie"], "sentences": ["It\u2019s also doing well in Taiwan, where it debuted this week, and releases in the big-boy South Korean and Chinese markets are imminent on 22 January and 28 February respectively."], "title": "Aamir Khan's religious satire PK becomes India's most successful film", "article": "The winner A fourth consecutive week at No 1 for the final Hobbit. Crossing $200m in US domestic this week was one more milestone on Bilbo\u2019s journey \u2013 but the question is how much it has left in the tank. Overseas, it\u2019s actually lagging a touch on previous episodes at the same point (Unexpected Journey, week four: $562.8m; Desolation: $528.1m; Five Armies: $504.7m), so perhaps Peter Jackson has forced the pace too much after six Tolkien outings in 13 years. The Chinese release on 23 January, though, should be a pick-me-up if it follows the upwardly bound trajectory of the series there, with Unexpected Journey taking $49m and Desolation of Smaug $74.2m. $900m worldwide looks within reach for Five Armies; $1bn not so much. Thinking man\u2019s Bollywood            It can\u2019t be disputed now: Aamir Khan has the global touch. His satire on world religion, PK \u2013 in 16th place on this week\u2019s chart \u2013 breaches the $90m mark worldwide this week and in doing so becomes the highest grossing Bollywood film ever. It\u2019s the fourth time he has claimed that record, after the Memento-inspired thriller Ghajini ($30m, 2008), college drama 3 Idiots ($62m, 2009) and action extravaganza Dhoom 3 ($85m, 2013). In last week\u2019s 2014 roundup, I speculated that the $100m Bollywood wasn\u2019t far enough \u2013 right around the corner, it transpires. What gives the Khan edge in global terms? One factor is that he has a quirkiness and innocence on screen that sets him apart from cookie-cutter Bollywood glam gods \u2013 things on show in PK, in which his Mr Bean-like alien gets to grips with the absurdities of organised religion on planet Earth. Khan\u2019s star vehicles seem more substantial and reflective than the bulk of the Indian mainstream (3 Idiots, in which he played a similar kind of holy fool, was a plea for better educational standards). Perhaps this gives them greater resonance with a diaspora inclined to getting impatient with the old masala clich\u00e9s. Of course, the PK phenomenon has strong foundations in India, where it has also become the most successful local film ever (currently on $48m, passing Dhoom 3\u2019s $41m). Not only does it delve headfirst into the syncretic melee of different faiths in that country, it takes direct aim at \u201cgodmen\u201d, the guru figures who proliferate there. PK actually had a relatively slow start on home turf \u2013 well under Happy New Year\u2019s record-breaking opening in October \u2013 but the film\u2019s quality and the controversy generated by the subject matter has seen it make up the gap in no time. Despite protests by some Hindu groups, the film isn\u2019t that provocative, though; more of a playful shove in the direction of greater tolerance and a more questioning attitude to institutionalised religion. So there\u2019s definitely scope for the film to appeal to spiritually concerned non-Indians, too - in China for starters, where 3 Idiots and Dhoom 3 both built a following for Khan. No word of a release there yet. Occidental tourist            Western attempts at eastern culture aren\u2019t always embraced on the opposite side of the globe \u2013 Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was one that underwhelmed box-office-wise. But Disney\u2019s cross-cultural animation Big Hero 6, set in the US-Japanese fusion city of San Fransoyko and with its anime-styled teen hero, seems to have nailed it. Early indications, including No 1 openings in Malaysia and Singapore in November, were good. And, released in Japan under the name Baymax (the film\u2019s inflatable robot sidekick) over the Christmas period, it has passed the key litmus test. Its $5.35m No 2 opening (beaten by the mightily monikered Yokai Watch the Movie: The Secret Is Created, Nyan!) compares favourably with the record-breaking Frozen\u2019s $6.37m at the beginning of 2014. Big Hero 6 dropped -20% on the second weekend, but rose +38% this one gone, taking its running total to $34.6m, sure to place it comfortably in Japan\u2019s 2015 top 10. It\u2019s also doing well in Taiwan, where it debuted this week, and releases in the big-boy South Korean and Chinese markets are imminent on 22 January and 28 February respectively. Disney has opted for a long release curve, and the film currently stands at $378.7m worldwide just over halfway along. $600m, and a place in the top 20 highest grossing animations might be within its grasp \u2013 depending on how excited the likes of Germany (22 Jan), the UK (30 Jan) and France (11 Feb) are still capable of getting about the Japanimation aesthetic. Big Hero 6 has also been winning praise for its multicultural ensemble, which might expand its appeal further in the west. But it doesn\u2019t quite have the universal-fairytale-denominator of Frozen. All-American girl              One frequent visitor to the worldwide chart these days is the Chinese local hit; global by virtue of a whopping domestic gross, despite showing virtually nowhere else. The Angelina Jolie-directed second world war drama Unbroken could be shaping up to be the American equivalent. It will get a full international rollout in close to 60 countries, but results from the first few have been disappointing. Spain is currently outpacing the UK, where star Jack O\u2019Connell (who plays former PoW Louis Zamperini) is from, which must be a disappointment for distributor Universal.  With Unbroken looking US-centric, it\u2019s worth reflecting on what Jolie has achieved there. A $30.6m debut was far ahead of expectations; better than openings for other straight dramas that have gone on to $200m+ over the last couple of years, like Captain Phillips ($25.7m) and Wolf of Wall Street ($18.3m). Jolie\u2019s name is a factor (the film showed a slight first-weekend female-audience bias, unusually for such macho material), but the crucial decision seems to have been to open the film wide \u2013 over 3,000 theatres \u2013 rather than as a specialty release. Post-Christmas, it excelled as counter-programmed alternative to the CGI fantasy of The Hobbit and Into the Woods \u2013 enabling Jolie to bypass some stinging notices. That might be not be as easy elsewhere (South Korea and the Netherlands are up next), where the level of local interest in Zamperini\u2019s story won\u2019t win Unbroken as much ground-entry box office. But with $94.6m current global tally, on a $65m budget, one thing is for sure: Jolie has opened her account as a viable commercial director (her debut, In the Land of Blood and Honey, took just $1.2m). The rest of the world            Brian Eno fans will be chuffed to see Hong Kong maestro Tsui Hark\u2019s The Taking of Tiger Mountain at the top of the Chinese box office. Based on the Peking opera about a People\u2019s Liberation Army/bandit standoff (which also inspired the Englishman\u2019s 1974 album), Hark\u2019s 3D epic has recovered from a fractionally under-par $25m opening to a very robust $110m take at the end of its first full week. Fellow Chinese blockbusters Gone With the Bullets ($81.3m) and John Woo\u2019s The Crossing ($32.3m) can now be filed as slight and major letdowns, respectively.  The Woman In Black 2 manifested, sans Daniel Radcliffe, in the US to a quarter less than the original: $15m, enough with an assorted $3.5m in overseas change, to put it at ninth on the global list. Holding fast at the top of the Korean chart and 11th globally is Yoon Je-kyoon\u2019s Ode to My Father, which gives an operatic, almost blockbuster-style treatment to the saga of an economic migrant who becomes the family breadwinner in the wake of the Korean war. Italian comedy Si Accettano Miracoli \u2013 about a family who fabricate a religious miracle \u2013 is another No 1 local strike (19th worldwide) for director-star, Neapolitan comedian Alessandro Siani, after 2013\u2019s Il Principe Abusivo. In Germany, fellow multi-hyphenate Til Schweiger is at 21st on the global rankings with Honig im Kopf, on which he serves as director, writer and actor. With its tale of a young girl who kidnaps her grandfather, who has Alzheimer\u2019s, Schweiger reportedly adds a sombre note to his usual rather slushy director\u2019s outings. With Honig currently standing at $18.5m, he, and long-time distribution pals Warner, will be hoping it hits the heights of his $42.9m for 2011\u2019s Kokow\u00e4\u00e4h. The future Grumpy action codger Liam Neeson \u2013 being softly spoken about his \u201cspecial skills\u201d in South Korea and Hong Kong this frame \u2013 brings Taken 3 to around 40 more countries, including the US, UK, Germany, Australia and Japan. Unbroken breaks in a smattering of European countries, and Rob Marshall\u2019s fairytale Sondheim adaptation Into the Woods expands, too. No space to examine its performance in detail this week - nor that of Universal\u2019s fantasy romp The Seventh Son, already No 1 in Russia (home for director Sergei Bodrov), Ukraine and plenty of the rest of the former Soviet Union. Starring Ben Barnes, Kit Harington, Julianne Moore and Jeff Bridges, it brings its dank visuals and mancheistic bluster to further marches of eastern Europe and, more exotically, to a couple of African territories as well.

The latest round of \u201creprioritised\u201d aid funding, announced by the Australian treasurer, Joe Hockey, in his mid-year economic and financial outlook, stripped another A$3.7bn (\u00a31.9bn) from the country\u2019s aid budget.  The move has further weakened Australia\u2019s influence in the Marshall Islands\u2019 capital, Majuro, where what De Brum referred to as Australia\u2019s \u201cbacksliding\u201d on climate change had already led to dismay; for the low-lying Marshall atolls, rising sea levels are a key issue.  Since taking office in 2013, the Coalition government in Australia has cut the foreign aid budget by more than A$11bn. De Brum said Australia\u2019s aid promises had \u201cderailed\u201d vital infrastructure projects in his country. In the middle of last year, he said, Australia pulled funding from water, energy and sewage projects in his constituency of Ebeye, setting them back \u201ca full year\u201d.  \u201cWe appreciate all the assistance we can get from our partners, but not in this kind of way when we get jerked around and it doesn\u2019t result in a well-thought-out, well-run, well-operated, well-executed plan,\u201d De Brum said.  The cuts, De Brum said, reduced Australia to an \u201cinsignificant\u201d aid partner for the Marshall Islands, which has a long-standing funding arrangement with the US and also influential Asian partners in Taiwan and Japan. The foreign minister was also scathing about Australia\u2019s decision to cut back ABC\u2019s international news service Radio Australia. \u201cNow, not only are we getting cut, we can\u2019t find out [in the news] if we get cut or not.\u201d A spokesperson for Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) said the government\u2019s aid program was \u201cgenerous\u201d, especially when it came to the Pacific. \u201cWe have focused Australia\u2019s aid program on our immediate region, and the Pacific is a particular focus. It is here that Australia has the most influence and can do the most good. We continue to work closely with Pacific partner countries and regional organisations to build resilience and manage the impacts of climate change on economic development.\u201d  Aluka Rakin, director of Youth to Youth in Health in Majuro, said the organisation\u2019s clinic is falling apart. The organisation provides sexual health advice and treatment for young people in the nation\u2019s most populated atoll, and has been able to rely on Australian funding in the past. But two years ago, cash for infrastructure and maintenance dried up \u2013 although volunteer help continued.  Rakin said further cuts in Australian aid can only make it harder. \u201cIt will really have a negative effect on the services we provide,\u201d he said. According to Rakin, the situation is even worse in Ebeye. Teenage pregnancy rates are high and sexually transmitted infections including HIV are increasing. There is no clinic for young people or safe-sex counselling service. \u201cWe are desperate for funding for the new clinic,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, with all the [Australian] assistance being cut, we are seeking help from Taiwan and Japan.\u201d  Alson Kelen, who runs Waan Aelon in Majol, an organisation aimed at providing skills training and other programs for young people who do not finish school, said he has had to be creative to survive the reduction in Australian assistance.  \u201cInstead of having three programs fully funded, we are getting one fully funded and spreading it over three \u2026 We see that Australian aid is shifting a bit. The Marshall Islands is getting less and it\u2019s affecting a few of us at the grassroots level. We used to have a few programs supported by Australia, but now there are less opportunities for us.\u201d    When it comes to climate change, Australia should advocate for its neighbours  Tony de Brum      Kelen said the people of low-lying island states feel that countries like Australia have a responsibility to look after them, as the effects of climate change will hit them hardest and soonest.\u201cWe look at big countries and the effect we are getting from their economic development, like climate change \u2026 it\u2019s hurting us,\u201d Kelen said.  Australia recently announced it would make a A$200m contribution to the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which will help vulnerable nations adapt to climate change. But the money will come from its aid budget.  Small nations, such as the Marshall Islands, may have received some of this money directly from Australia as bilateral aid. But now, De Brum said, the tiny nation would have to compete for funding with countries around the world. Contributing to the GCF by taking money from the aid budget had moved Australian money \u201cfurther away\u201d from the Marshall Islands, he said.  \u201cAustralia should take a leadership role and be part of the Pacific. When it comes to climate change they should advocate for their neighbours and not behave as if there is nothing around Australia except its coal and its bottom line, and ballot boxes,\u201d De Brum said. On De Brum\u2019s criticism of the source of Australia\u2019s donation to the GCF, the Dfat spokesperson said the government had already made headway on increasing climate resilience in the Marshall Islands through its aid programs outside the GCF. \u201cAustralia is also working with all countries, including our Pacific islands neighbours, to develop a new global climate change agreement that establishes a common playing field for climate action from 2020. Our support for Pacific programs, such as those administered by the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Program have delivered real outcomes in [the] Republic of Marshall Islands by enhancing water security and other forms of economic and environmental resilience.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/11/dvds-downloads-guy-lodge-looking-ghost-shell-lucy", "publicationDate": "2015-01-11T08:00:11Z", "tags": ["DVD and video reviews", "Film", "Scarlett Johansson", "Dan Stevens", "Luc Besson", "Nicole Kidman", "Guy Pearce", "Drama", "Horror", "Science fiction and fantasy", "Culture"], "sentences": ["As the eponymous heroine, a Taiwan-based student who gains psychokinetic powers from an accidental drug infusion, Johansson is as incandescently alien as she was in Under the Skin; the film\u2019s too besotted with her to think rationally for one minute, but it\u2019s still Besson\u2019s best in aeons."], "title": "DVDs and downloads: Looking, Ghost in the Shell, Lucy, Before I Go to Sleep, The Guest, The Rover, Night Moves", "article": "Last January an influx of year-ahead trend pieces predicted the arrival of \u201cpeak beard\u201d \u2013 a projection to which HBO\u2019s whip-smart semi-sitcom Looking (Warner, 18), its handsome ensemble decorated scene-for-scene with a dazzling array of facial foliage, immediately landed as a pointed rejoinder. A year later, ubiquitous urban beardage is still with us. Happily, so is Looking, the second series of which debuts across the pond tonight, while the first belatedly hits our DVD shelves tomorrow. It\u2019s worth catching up. A laid-back landmark in 21st-century gay portraiture for the small screen, this San Francisco-set survey of assorted bright (and not-so-bright) young things and their rotating, often freewheeling, private lives gets right what the over-stimulated US remake of Queer As Folk didn\u2019t; the imprint of executive producer Andrew Haigh (Weekend) is clear in its balance of wistful rumination and matter-of-fact raunch. In capturing a kind of wishful coffee-bar bohemia, Looking plays particularly well as a companion piece to Lena Dunham\u2019s evolving but persistently wonderful Girls (Warner, 15), the third series of which is also out tomorrow \u2013 though the former\u2019s scruff is, obviously, considerably more impressive. Insider Hollywood was abuzz last week with the news that the long-mooted US remake of Japanese action-anime Ghost in the Shell \u2013 a fiercely brilliant meditation on human-cyborg identity, 20 years old this year and conveniently added to the Netflix library only last week \u2013 is finally going ahead, with Scarlett Johansson as its live-action lead. The smartest response came from American critic James Rocchi, pointing out that, contrary to popular belief, there are good parts for women in modern film, \u201cbut a) they aren\u2019t human and b) they\u2019re all ScarJo\u201d. Luc Besson\u2019s dizzy techno-thriller Lucy (Universal, 15) further underlines the point: a steel-plated sugar-rush of irresistible idiocy, it\u2019s the rare multiplex shoot \u2019em up that doesn\u2019t just accommodate a female star\u2019s charisma, but positively runs on it. As the eponymous heroine, a Taiwan-based student who gains psychokinetic powers from an accidental drug infusion, Johansson is as incandescently alien as she was in Under the Skin; the film\u2019s too besotted with her to think rationally for one minute, but it\u2019s still Besson\u2019s best in aeons.     \u2018Incandescently alien\u2019: Scarlett Johansson in Lucy. Photograph: Allstar/EUROPACORP    Would that Nicole Kidman could find a mainstream vehicle equally interested in her. An actor with an excitingly left-field taste in art, she has peculiarly duff instincts for trash. Enter the regrettably titled Before I Go to Sleep (Studiocanal, 15), which adapts the SJ Watson bestseller with commendably neo-Hitchcockian intentions \u2013 amnesia, mistaken identity, Colin Firth doing a sort of Cary Grant number \u2013 but is too stiffly tasteful to rustle up one scare. So often, it\u2019s the actors from whom you expect the least who throw themselves into B-movies with the necessary abandon. Dan Stevens, a suet-pudding cypher in his time on the unspeakable Downton Abbey, is a hot, nasty revelation in The Guest (Icon, 15), a fired-up, 1980s-spritzed nerve-jangler from US horror talent Adam Wingard. Gym-cut, frosty eyed and scarcely recognisable as an enigmatic ex-marine who inserts himself into a grieving midwest family with a zealous sense of purpose, Stevens reveals something genuinely alarming in his hitherto all-English implacability; a showdown between this slick-haired automaton and Johansson\u2019s Lucy would be something to witness.     \u2018A hot, nasty revelation\u2019: Dan Stevens in The Guest.

For slow-burning agitation done right, check out Kelly Reichardt\u2019s excellent Night Moves (Soda, 15), in which the indie director\u2019s aptitude for softly-softly minimalism proves a neat fit for a narrative built on high-stakes psychological terror: Jesse Eisenberg, Peter Sarsgaard and an inventively cast Dakota Fanning make a brittly compelling team as a trio of environmental activists whose right-on actions take a turn for the ghoulish.

The novelist\u2019s long-awaited reincarnation as an agony uncle began on Friday when he started responding to fans\u2019 online questions about, among other topics, bringing up children and hate speech, although he predictably steered away from offering any insights into his private life. The 66-year-old\u2019s advice column debut was notable, too, for the absence of any discussion about his well-known passion for jazz, cats, running and the Yakult Swallows baseball team. A day after its launch, Murakami-san no tokoro \u2013 or Mr Murakami\u2019s Place \u2013 is playing it safe, in keeping with his insistence on indulging in light-hearted conversation with his readers. Launched by the publishing company Shinchosha, the website shows cartoon renderings of Murakami, dressed in a blue sweater and sitting with animals or typing on a laptop. The site will accept questions until 31 January, with Murakami\u2019s responses to a small selection appearing over the following two months. In 10 brief contributions on the site on Friday, Murakami confirmed his reputation for reticence, but displayed moments of sardonic wit that will delight devotees in Japan and dozens of other countries where his books have sold millions in translation. One of the early questions came from a 51-year-old doctor who wondered if he was entitled to a \u201cspecial invitation\u201d to spend a day by the author\u2019s side. He may have been disappointed with Murakami\u2019s polite, but firm, reply: \u201cThere are tiny secrets about my life, so it would be troubling for you to take a peek into it,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, try taking a look into other people\u2019s lives.\u201d Murakami, who established himself as a leading author with his 1987 novel Norwegian Wood, is coaxed into a rare loquacious response to a question about the \u201cglobal problem\u201d of hate speech. \u201cAs a novelist, I am occasionally the target of hate speech,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere are, after all, some awful people out there \u2026 We have to do something about this trend.\u201d It was not fair, he added, to target people because of their race or other things over which they had no control. He assured visitors to the site that he would read and reply to the questions personally. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I just sign what I made an assistant or editor write,\u201d he said in a greeting. \u201cUnfortunately I only have one body \u2026 I can\u2019t answer everyone.\u201d The site is in Japanese, but Shinchosha said it would accept questions in English and other languages: an English translation of the application form can be found at the Taiwan, Japan, Spain and I blog. The writer rarely appears in public, preferring to restrict any direct contact with his readers to occasional message exchanges. He has, though, spoken out on contentious topics, such as nuclear power, peace and Japan\u2019s resurgent nationalism. Readers are invited to post questions or \u201clittle somethings\u201d they want to share with the author. No subject is taboo, although messages should contain a maximum of 1,200 characters. One reader, a 43-year-old woman, managed to elicit a guarded response about Murakami\u2019s writing plans. Asked if he had considered a third work of non-fiction to add to those about running and the 1995 sarin gas attacks on the Tokyo subway, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it, but there\u2019s been no real movement on this. The preparation is really hard work.\u201d Another person asked him how he would improve one of his best-known novels, Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, if he had the chance to write the 30-year-old work again. \u201cWhen you think about a girl you dated a long time ago, don\u2019t you find yourself thinking, \u2018Ah, if only things had gone better,\u2019\u201d Murakami replied. \u201cI often do. It\u2019s the same thing \u2026 if only things had gone better. That said, then was then, and I think I did my best.\u201d Murakami only embraces his agony uncle alter ego once, when a 32-year-old mother explains that she wants to bring up her 11-year-old son to be like him. \u201cHe plays computer games every day and never reads books,\u201d she complained. Murakami replied: \u201cBring him up like me? I wonder what you mean by that. It\u2019s quite tough being me \u2026 but I somehow managed it, because I am me. \u201cIf you mean you want to bring him up to like books, then I think you have to leave that up to him,\u201d he said, adding that he no longer reads as much as he would like since his eyesight seems to have deteriorated slightly. In response to a 49-year-old woman born on the same date as the novelist \u2013 12 January \u2013 he points out that they share a birthday with the author Jack London, but also with the Nazi second-in-command Hermann G\u00f6ring. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit of a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it turns out that after the allies arrested the most senior Nazis after the war, G\u00f6ring performed best at a kind of intelligence test. Maybe that was down to his date of birth.\u201d Murakami went on to say he celebrated his birthday with a visit to a restaurant, where he ate a \u201cseafood tower\u201d: a stack of delicacies comprising shrimp, lobster, oysters, mussels, sashimi and octopus. \u201cIt was incredible,\u201d he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/16/xiaomi-chinas-equivalent-to-apple", "publicationDate": "2015-01-16T12:37:28Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Mobile phones", "Internet of things", "Apple", "Telecoms", "China", "Asia Pacific", "Business"], "sentences": ["Thompson lives in Taiwan, where he is able to observe the particular social and practical nuances of the fast-moving smartphone and internet market in Asia at ground level \u2013 unlike many commentators in the west, who see only the surface sheen of Xiaomi\u2019s products."], "title": "Xiaomi: It's China's Apple, though you've probably never heard of it", "article": "The easy way to think of Xiaomi is as a Chinese smartphone maker which mimics Apple\u2019s designs. But that would be wrong. It\u2019s a narrative that was enunciated by Apple\u2019s head of design Jonathan Ive, who when asked about the company last October was blunt: he \u201cdidn\u2019t see [the similarities in design] as flattery\u201d and called the superficial similarity in appearance of Xiaomi\u2019s phones and software \u201ctheft\u201d and \u201clazy\u201d. Some might instead think it\u2019s a startup that aims to undermine Samsung, previously the sales leader in China, by offering phones with the same specifications as the South Korean giant, but at lower prices. Certainly it has mimicked some of its names: one of the new phones unveiled on Wednesday, a 5.7in device called the \u201cMi Note\u201d, echoes the 5.7in Galaxy Note phablet range. Both lines of thinking miss what keener observers believe is Xiaomi\u2019s true character, and its ambition: to become China\u2019s biggest provider of internet-connected devices to an eager, ever loyal, following drawn from a young demographic numbering hundreds of millions who will soon be outfitting their first homes \u2013 and looking for a brand to help furnish it. Furthermore, it could be ideally placed to do what neither Apple nor Samsung can: become the first company of the smartphone age able to shift into and control the next era \u2013 the \u201cinternet of things\u201d age, when all sorts of items around the home and elsewhere have internet connectivity.

Photograph: Jason Lee/Reuters    Neither the company\u2019s chief executive/founder Leu Jun, nor any of its pronouncements, have expounded that strategy. Yet it\u2019s clear that it must have had a persuasive story to lure Hugo Barra away from head of product management for Android inside Google in mid-2013 to spearhead its international expansion. Barra\u2019s interviews, however, haven\u2019t said anything about longer-term strategy; only that he saw \u201ca dream job, this idea of building a global company which could be as significant as Google, from the ground up.\u201d He suggested in September 2013 that it would aim to sell its phones nearly at cost, and profit on services \u2013 but which services is unspecified. Most people outside China, or away from the tech mainstream, haven\u2019t heard of Xiaomi. Even the pronunciation can be a challenge; try replacing the \u201cer\u201d sound in \u201cshower\u201d with \u201cme\u201d (that is, \u201csh-ow-me\u201d). In China, though, Jun has almost rockstar status, product unveilings are shrouded in mystery and rumours \u2013 before the latest phones were released, some suggested (wrongly) they would have expensive sapphire screens \u2013 and thousands of excited fans pack the venues.     Three models of China\u2019s Xiaomi Mi phones pictured at a launch in New Delhi in July 2014. Photograph: Anindito Mukherjee /Reuters    However, if Xiaomi were just another smartphone company, even a popular one in the world\u2019s biggest phone market, that wouldn\u2019t really justify the $45bn valuation it attracted in late December when it raised $1.1bn in venture funding. Handset makers generally struggle to make profit, even in China where hardly any use Google\u2019s services, instead using the open-source Android Open Source Platform (AOSP) and offer (and monetise) their own maps, search and app download services. As a phone company, it\u2019s thriving: Jun founded Xiaomi in 2010, having already had success as chief executive at software maker Kingsoft, Joyo (which he sold to Amazon for $75m in August 2004), and as chairman of browser maker UCWeb. Xiaomi\u2019s revenues have doubled each year, and it ended 2014 having shipped 61m smartphones \u2013 more, that is, than the entire Windows Phone ecosystem, where about 50m were shipped. In all, 97% of Xiaomi\u2019s phones were sold in China, with a few in India and the rest of Asia. So what\u2019s special about it? The first clear clues emerged with a study in January 2014 by analytics company Flurry, which found Xiaomi users spend more time on their devices than those of any other brand \u2013 including Apple\u2019s iPhone. For every 100 minutes iPhone users spent in apps, Xiaomi users spent 107; for Samsung users the figure was 86, for HTC users 73, and averaged across other Android devices it was 71. That means Xiaomi users spent 50% more time on their phones than non-brand Android users.     Xiaomi users are younger than average and more likely to be using their phone for business use.   Flurry dug deeper and found another key difference: compared to the average smartphone owner, those on Xiaomi were much more likely to be aged between 18 and 34, and much less likely to be aged over 35. They\u2019re also more than twice as likely as the average to be business professionals (rather than parents, fitness nuts or gamers), probably from university \u2013 a demographic expanding by about seven million every year, and by 2020 will number 195 million just in China, more than is forecast for the entire US workforce. All this points to the key appeal and enormous potential of the company, says Ben Thompson, who has worked at both Microsoft and Apple, and now runs his own blog \u2013 Stratechery \u2013 and consultancy. Thompson lives in Taiwan, where he is able to observe the particular social and practical nuances of the fast-moving smartphone and internet market in Asia at ground level \u2013 unlike many commentators in the west, who see only the surface sheen of Xiaomi\u2019s products.     Is he China\u2019s answer to Steve Jobs? Lei Jun stakes Xiaomi\u2019s claim to Apple Inc\u2019s crown as he unveils the flagship Mi Note, its challenger to Apple\u2019s iPhone 6 Plus. Photograph: Jason Lee/Reuters    Earlier this month, Thompson outlined on his blog how he sees Xiaomi\u2019s ambition playing out. Because most of the target demographic will still be living with their parents, even at 24 (renting is \u201cfrowned upon\u201d, he says), they have disposable cash; they also have a desire to build their own lifestyle that differs from their parents. Unlike their parents, the upcoming demographic will value home-grown brands. And when the time comes to leave home, Thompson explains, those Xiaomi fans \u201cwill need to buy TVs and air purifiers and all kinds of (relatively) high renminbi [price] goods. And which brand do you think they will choose?\u201d They can already choose an Xiaomi air purifier, smart TV, tablet, Wi-Fi router, Wi-Fi dongle and fitness band; as of Thursday, there will also be headphones and a tiny TV set-top box the size of an iPad charger with Chromecast-like functions. Can a watch be far behind? The company has invested in iHealth, a healthcare device maker with offices in the US and China, and in other companies that make mobile payments systems, Wi-Fi LED bulbs, and portable chargers. In the future, might there be Xiaomi-linked washing machines, dishwashers, door locks? It\u2019s not inconceivable. But how does that put it ahead of Apple or Samsung, where the latter has announced a $100m fund to develop its \u201cinternet of things\u201d (IoT) strategy, and Apple has offered HomeKit, a platform for connecting IoT devices to iOS? In that, Xiaomi\u2019s advantage is that it doesn\u2019t have any of what Benedict Evans, an analyst at venture capital company Andreessen Horowitz, calls \u201ctechnical debt\u201d. Writing on his blog this week, he noted that Apple and Google (with Android) overcame the incumbents, Nokia and BlackBerry, because they could build devices using technologies \u2013 big touchscreens, fast mobile networks \u2013 that would have sunk them in 2000, but led to success after 2007.

Photograph: Ng Han Guan/AP    Could it be that Xiaomi is also free of the original assumptions of smartphone builders, and can be the first IoT company? Thompson thinks so: \u201cyou could argue that Xiaomi is actually the first \u201cinternet of things\u201d company: unlike Google (Nest), Apple (HomeKit), or even Samsung (SmartThings), all of whom are offering some sort of open software development kit to tie everything together (a necessity given that most of their customers already have appliances that won\u2019t be replaced anytime soon), Xiaomi is integrating everything itself and selling everything one needs on Mi.com to a fan base primed to outfit their homes for the very first time,\u201d he writes. After watching the latest product unveiling, Thompson noted in his subscriber-only email that the introduction of the two top-end phones \u2013 priced notably higher than any previous Xiaomi models \u2013 were a surprise. But, he realised, it\u2019s just a refinement of its aims: just like any company, it wants to build a \u201cmoat\u201d \u2013 a unique selling point that protects it from would-be rivals undercutting or displacing it. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic strategy,\u201d Thompson noted: \u201cbring someone in on the low end and gradually lever them up into higher priced \u2013 and higher margin \u2013 segments. It also makes sense; it perhaps turns out that Xiaomi is, in the end, first and foremost a phone company, just one that is trying to build an actual moat around an Android-based operating system.\u201d In that way, Xiaomi isn\u2019t copying anyone; it\u2019s striking out on its own, an insurgent in the mobile phone space with an eye on a future that older companies might not be able to follow it into. That could make it easily worth its huge valuation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jan/22/grey-nomads-backpackers-and-locals-the-truth-about-picking-grapes-in-australia", "publicationDate": "2015-01-22T05:53:05Z", "tags": ["New South Wales", "Working holidays", "Australia news", "Work & careers"], "sentences": ["Many held working-holiday visas from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, France and Germany, and, to qualify for a second-year stay in the country, were completing three months of work in regional Australia."], "title": "Grey nomads, backpackers and locals: the truth about picking grapes in Australia", "article": "By the time the sun breaks on the grapevines of Tyrrell\u2019s estate in Pokolbin in the Hunter Valley, 60 or so fruit-pickers have been hard at work for more than an hour. They are a hive of energy, dressed in hats and with mud on their boots, each armed with a tiny pair of clippers and a bucket. The business of grape-picking had a moment in the national spotlight last week when a story in Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph accused young welfare recipients of being \u201ctoo lazy\u201d to work harvesting jobs in Hunter wineries.  It followed a report, published by Guardian Australia among others, that portrayed a fruit-picking industry rife with unscrupulous operators, with one Victorian grower paying pickers as little as 60c an hour.  So what\u2019s it like to pick grapes in Australia? I travelled two hours north of Sydney to find out. Here at Tyrrell\u2019s Wines the local forewoman (who would prefer to remain anonymous) likes to shake hands with prospective employees to assess their experience: baby-soft paws haven\u2019t seen a day of real work. She tells me, without malice: \u201cYou won\u2019t make it.\u201d Fair enough. I\u2019m thrown in with a group of seasoned pickers, one of three tribes who I\u2019ll soon learn contribute to the grape-picking population. This first is made up of the grey nomads, Australian retirees in their 60s and 70s who wander the land in jacked-up caravans, boasting state-of-the-art portable barbecues and picking up casual jobs when they feel like it.     Bruce and Denise King, originally from Kempsey in NSW, have been on the road six years    For Denise King, 65, and her husband, Bruce, it is their third season picking for the Tyrrell family, and altogether they\u2019ve been on the road for six years. She tells me their Jayco Freedom off-roader not only features a shower and toilet but a washing machine: \u201cI don\u2019t rough it, I\u2019m too old!\u201d Grape-picking doesn\u2019t prove to be difficult (snip the bunch off the vine and throw it into your bucket) but it gives new meaning to the phrase \u201cback-breaking work\u201d. I\u2019m impressed by the vitality and speed with which the grey-haired cohort work. King tells me the work keeps her \u201cfit and virile, ready for plenty of loving. Key to staying young is plenty of loving!\u201d she chortles.  The Kings have done working stints at a resort in Coral Bay, Western Australia, and picked fruit in Stanthorpe, Queensland. The former Kempsey nurse says the best thing about this nomadic life is that \u201cyou get away from your grandchildren \u2013 says the worst grandmother ever! I\u2019d rather have a glass of wine than babysit.\u201d     The final product: a bottle of Tyrrell\u2019s award-winning Vat 47 Hunter Chardonnay    We are picking pale green chardonnay grapes and they\u2019re smaller and more tightly bunched together than regular table grapes. I pop one in my mouth. It\u2019s sweet and delicious.  I ask Maud David, a 25-year-old from France and member of the grape-pickers\u2019 backpacker contingent, if she likes Australian wine. She says with brutal honesty our wine is generally \u201cno good\u201d. It is David\u2019s third day of picking on the property and her first experience doing so. She is one of many French backpackers here; most sleep in campervans and station wagons at a $65-a-week campground nearby. \u201cIn France I have a really comfortable life, I have a house,\u201d says David. \u201cHere I sleep in a car and on the road I don\u2019t have a shower or laundry. But it\u2019s fun.\u201d  Back in her hometown of Lyon, David completed an environmental quality and safety management degree. She considers her working holiday in Australia as downtime between her degree and professional life.  She plans to work on the farm for month (\u201cIf I can make it\u201d) and says it\u2019s an improvement to her $13-an-hour casual job at a Sydney bakery. \u201cThe bakery never even asked for my tax file number. Picking grapes I get paid $22.30 an hour and since it\u2019s not a big town I don\u2019t go out and spend money.\u201d     Local worker Hayden Slade says grape-picking \u2018beats sitting in an office all day\u2019    Hayden Slade, 18, hails from the nearby town of Cessnock and says in the year since graduating from high school he has been doing a range of land management work, including spraying weeds and picking. \u201cI know there are a lot of opportunities for uni and stuff like that around here, but my family\u2019s been doing this since I can remember,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t really know much else.\u201d  He says he enjoys a life outdoors. \u201cBeats sitting in an office all day!\u201d Somewhat less enthusiastic is 21-year-old Sarah Chisholm. Like Slade, she followed her family into picking work and her father, a permanent staff member at Tyrrell\u2019s, is manning one the tractors. Chisholm\u2019s first time picking was two years ago, and she hated it. \u201cIt was hot, it was horrible,\u201d she says. She didn\u2019t last long. \u201cThought I had better things to do.\u201d \u201cAnd turns out you don\u2019t?\u201d She laughs. \u201cI need the money.\u201d As Chisholm explains, jobs are scarce her home-town of Bellbird, a 20-minute drive away. She\u2019s about to sit a driving test and hopes it might improve her chances of finding a job outside the town. In the meantime, her boyfriend is out of work with a broken femur and there is board to pay \u2013 $150 a week living with him at the back of his mother\u2019s house. Work doesn\u2019t stop when the rain turns from a fine mist to a deluge. We are all soaked to the bone and the soil has turned to sticky mud. But the atmosphere is sunny \u2013 even if the skies are not \u2013 and the supervisors gee us up: \u201cThis is when it gets good!\u201d     Bruce Tyrrell is a fourth-generation winemaker. Photograph: Tyrrell's Wines    Still, I don\u2019t complain when I\u2019m told that the vineyard owner, Bruce Tyrrell, is ready to give an interview. I drive up to the main building, passing by rows of genteel red and yellow roses, and enter the circa-1800s farmhouse with mud caked on the bottom of my boots.  Bruce is the fourth-generation Tyrrell to own the winery, which was established in 1859. The 350-hectare property produces a couple of million bottles of wine each year and claims credit for starting Australia\u2019s chardonnay boom, after first planting chardonnay grapes in 1971. Tyrrell has strong opinions about the vineyard\u2019s attempts to source workers from the nearby town of Cessnock, which he describes as \u201clike an unflushed sewer, it\u2019s full of drugs\u201d. Communities in the Hunter region are often split between two industries, mining and wine tourism, and Tyrrell criticises both the new generation of miners who get paid $150K to \u201csit in a truck\u201d, and a section of townsfolk who are third- or fourth- generation unemployed, by his account. \u201cYou see these older members of the community and they\u2019re proud, the old blokes, with the trim moustaches and ramrod straight backs. You can see them go, how did this ever happen?\u201d While the town has an 13% youth unemployment rate, similar to the state average, this peaks at 29% in certain districts such as Wollombi. Tyrrell has difficulty understanding why more young people don\u2019t sign up for grape-picking work. Secretly I feel some sympathy for them \u2013 I\u2019m not exactly rushing to get back out there as I sip on a glass of elegant 2013 Hunter Valley Moon Mountain inside the tasting room, while squalling wind and rain beat against the window. Work is called off at 11.30am owing to the weather conditions, which means the pickers will collect about $130 for their efforts today. A Daily Telegraph line that workers \u201ccould easily earn $250 a day\u201d, which equates to more than 10 hours of work in one day, is rarely the case. More often than not pickers fail to be allocated full 38-hour weeks of work during the one- or two-month picking season.     Rows of grapevines at Tyrrell\u2019s    As well as being an award-winning winemaker, Andrew Margan is head of the Hunter Valley Wine Industry Association. Any lack of interest in grape-picking among locals doesn\u2019t surprise him. \u201cAs you know it\u2019s hard work,\u201d he says. \u201cThis morning was cool but quite often it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s sticky, there are spiders, it\u2019s muddy. It\u2019s not particularly nice work to do and kids don\u2019t like doing it. It\u2019s too hard work for them.\u201d Margan says the industry often fails to compete mining on salaries, although it becomes easier to attract workers during mining market downturns. Sourcing workers from father afield is likewise challenging owing to the lack of affordable, short-term accommodation. With the exception of a few backpacker hostels (which ask about $37 a night for a dorm room), the pay checks of most workers would fail to cover a stay in the remaining hotels. This leaves a mobile population of travellers to pick up the slack. And by and large, while operators such as Tyrrell\u2019s strive to comply with federal workplace laws, there do remain unscrupulous worker supply contractors who consider such an itinerant class of casual workers, many of whom have English as a second language and are unfamiliar with Australian law, as ripe for exploitation.  One audit of 22 Hunter Valley businesses revealed 80% of the 500 workers were from overseas and predominantly under 25. Many held working-holiday visas from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, France and Germany, and, to qualify for a second-year stay in the country, were completing three months of work in regional Australia. Inspectors found four employers had underpaid 68 employees a total of $14,120 and the most common issue was underpayment for weekend and public holiday work. A few workers also had the cost of pruning shears unlawfully deducted from their wages.      Guardian reporter Monica Tan takes her field reporting seriously    Margan says the existence these days of the fair work ombudsman has led to, across the board, an enforcement of a rate for horticulture of $21.08 an hour \u2013 with the more rogue contractors skipping town.  Back at Tyrrell\u2019s, the winemaker seems to have a mixed attitude to the staff of the fair work ombudsman. On the one hand he calls them \u201cvery aggressive. They\u2019re out there to fine us,\u201d Tyrell complains, adding, \u201cThey never seem to hit the people that are cheating on the system, because that\u2019s too hard.\u201d  On the other hand he himself has dobbed in crooks to the authorities, he says, and regales me with examples of workers out in Bourke who have picked table grapes for $6.50 an hour, and of 20 workers registered under one passport. \u201cThat\u2019s bad news,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what gets us all into trouble.\u201d Back in Sydney I ask a friend and former journalist, who is now unemployed and on the dole, if she would ever consider grape-picking. She lives on the edge of western Sydney with her parents and, at 33, is still young, fit, adventurous and has never been afraid of a physical challenge. But still she replies with an emphatic no. \u201cI would only do it if it was going to be short term, but it\u2019s not a sustainable solution,\u201d she tells me.  Her situation, and not an uncommon one, is further complicated by the fact that she doesn\u2019t have a car.  \u201cThose jobs are catered towards backpackers. It would be an interesting experience if you were living overseas or straight after school. But it\u2019s not something that I would want to put down on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/23/eddie-huang-tv-fresh-off-the-boat", "publicationDate": "2015-01-23T18:40:01Z", "tags": ["US television", "Television", "Food & drink", "Culture", "Television & radio", "Race issues", "Life and style", "World news"], "sentences": ["As New York\u2019s culinary enfant terrible, the perfecter of the Taiwanese gua bao, a hip-hop aficionado, a former weed dealer, a lawyer, and a TED fellow \u2013 until he got booted out for, he claimed, skipping a conference to go on a podcast with a porn star \u2013 Huang has made a career out of being confrontational.", "In his autobiography, described by the New York Times as \u201ca surprisingly sophisticated memoir about race and assimilation in America\u201d, Huang portrayed his childhood as one of being torn between his \u201cfresh off the boat\u201d Taiwanese parents and the overt racism within the white American community.", "While Huang\u2019s father, Louis (played by Park, who recently starred as Kim Jong Un in The Interview), was a gangster in his native Taiwan, Huang describes the show\u2019s version of his father as \u201cwhat white people think about Asian American dads: goofy, inept, emasculated, kind of a bitch\u201d."], "title": "Eddie Huang won't back down: 'I'm on TV because I tell the truth'", "article": "One day, when Eddie Huang entered the writers\u2019 room of ABC\u2019s Fresh Off the Boat, the family-friendly sitcom based on his memoir of the same name, the writers were sharing a joke about Huang\u2019s grandfather castrating a pig with a stick.  The incident never happened. The writers insisted it was funny. Huang insisted it was \u201csavage\u201d, the equivalent of telling a dog-eating joke. A compromise was eventually made with a lesser joke about hot buns, volunteered by a Vietnamese American writer, a fact not lost on Huang. But the tone of the relationship was already defined: Huang, the self-defined \u201cbig-dick Asian\u201d, would not be kept down. As New York\u2019s culinary enfant terrible, the perfecter of the Taiwanese gua bao, a hip-hop aficionado, a former weed dealer, a lawyer, and a TED fellow \u2013 until he got booted out for, he claimed, skipping a conference to go on a podcast with a porn star \u2013 Huang has made a career out of being confrontational. Especially against network executives, who have spent most of a publicity tour for the show attempting to cover up his outspokenness \u2013 with little success. Speaking via Skype from Los Angeles, where Huang lives most of the time when not travelling for his Vice web series, Huang\u2019s World, or cooking for his restaurant, Baohaus, in New York, Huang appears both pleased with and wary of the TV show, which is based on his family\u2019s move from Washington DC to the mostly white suburbs of Orlando, Florida, during the 90s.  \u201cWe\u2019re all proud of our own work, but it didn\u2019t need to be this hard, and it also should be more progressive as a show. You know, we need to push the boundaries,\u201d he says, referring to his recent op-ed in New York magazine, in which he called out the network for wanting to make, in his words, a \u201cuniversal, ambiguous, cornstarch story about Asian-Americans resembling moo goo gai pan written by a Persian-American [Nahnatchka Khan] who cut her teeth on race relations writing for Seth MacFarlane.\u201d A recent TCA (Television Critics Association) panel, where one of the first questions was about whether chopsticks would feature in the show, highlighted the cast\u2019s frustrations on set. In his autobiography, described by the New York Times as \u201ca surprisingly sophisticated memoir about race and assimilation in America\u201d, Huang portrayed his childhood as one of being torn between his \u201cfresh off the boat\u201d Taiwanese parents and the overt racism within the white American community. He eventually found solace in African American culture and hip-hop, whose embrace of its own marginalisation provided Huang with the inspiration to create his \u201cdick-swinging\u201d identity.  As a result, the memoir is filled with bawdy and foul-mouthed anecdotes about swiping CDs, selling pornography to classmates, getting into brawls over racial taunts, and pestering his mother for the latest Michael Jordan basketball shoes, while simultaneously highlighting his growing interest in food such as xiang wei (soup dumplings), and the writings of Tupac, Lao Tzu, Jonathan Swift and Michael Ondaatje. The show, on the other hand, is a network comedy, and often laugh-out-loud funny. In the pilot, one of Huang\u2019s real-life experiences takes a comical, yet pointed, turn in which, after being told their son threw an African American classmate across the room in response to being called a \u201cchink\u201d, Huang\u2019s parents (played by Constance Wu and Randall Park) threaten to sue the principal, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the American way, right?\u201d Immediately afterward, they offer him discount coupons for their newly opened Cattleman\u2019s Ranch restaurant \u2013 an embarrassing gesture that will bring groans of recognition from many of immigrant backgrounds. In both the show and the memoir, the \u201cchink\u201d incident is a turning point, symbolising the banding together of the family as they stand up for themselves in their new home. But in the show, the anger behind the action, as well as the darker aspects of the memoir, including domestic violence and Huang\u2019s struggles with the law, are largely ignored. (Huang was incarcerated twice before the age of 25: for attacking a classmate and for carrying a concealed weapon.) It\u2019s therefore understandable that he\u2019s unhappy with a lot of the changes. While Huang\u2019s father, Louis (played by Park, who recently starred as Kim Jong Un in The Interview), was a gangster in his native Taiwan, Huang describes the show\u2019s version of his father as \u201cwhat white people think about Asian American dads: goofy, inept, emasculated, kind of a bitch\u201d.     A scene from Fresh Off The Boat. Photograph: Gilles Mingasson/ABC    In the writers\u2019 room, Huang says, he was largely kept to the periphery. This meant that often the jokes would come from writers who, although culturally diverse, could not provide the authenticity of experience associated with an east Asian background. Hence the pig castration joke. After all, \u201cthe only person who could come up with a joke and turn it around was another east Asian person,\u201d Huang says. \u201cBecause they know how it feels.\u201d As the first television show to feature an Asian American family since Margaret Cho\u2019s ill-received All-American Girl over 20 years ago (Cho is a mentor for Huang; \u201cI look up to Margaret a lot\u201d), Fresh Off the Boat has already prompted discussion about representation of Asians in the media. For Huang, however, who recognizes the show as \u201chistoric\u201d and whose success could lead to support of more Asian American projects in the future, it is merely the beginning of a wider conversation about Asian Americans and race. \u201cI want people to realise that this is a starting point, and this is something we need to continually work on,\u201d he says. Huang\u2019s aim is to do shows from an Asian American perspective without being reduced to the use of stereotypes. \u201cWhat I\u2019m fighting for is specificity, and being like, \u2018Yo, keep it like my story.\u2019 That matters to me. You\u2019re a real fucking person.\u201d In addition to Fresh Off The Boat, Huang, 32, still has a lot to do. As well as wanting to write feature films, he\u2019s looking forward to continuing work on his Vice show, which follows him travelling and eating around the world. He\u2019s also working on a second book, a memoir about time spent in China. But he says he\u2019ll always be telling the truth. \u201cI don\u2019t want race, gender, sexual orientation or lifestyle or culture ever to limit anyone\u2019s ability to experience life their own way,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause it sucks to wake up and have parts of the world cut off to you.\u201d  Especially when it comes to the network, which remains supportive but circumspect. \u201cI think they just ran into some kids for once who were like, number one, you can\u2019t pay me enough to do what you want me to do, and secondly, it probably isn\u2019t financially beneficial for me to listen to you,\u201d he says.  \u201cI\u2019m not, like, a good-looking dude. I\u2019m like 5\u20197\u2019\u2019, chubby and Asian.

Reuters reported that Foxconn will cut its massive workforce as the Apple supplier faces declining revenue growth and rising wages in China. According to Reuters, which interviewed special assistant to the chairman and group spokesman Louis Woo, Foxconn was considering a reduction in its workforce of 1.3 million people \u201cWe\u2019ve basically stabilized [our workforce] in the last three years,\u201d Woo said, according to Reuters, which also reported he answered \u201cyes\u201d when asked whether the company plans to reduce overall headcount. Woo did not specify a timeframe or target for the reduction, Reuters reported, but noted that labor costs had more than doubled since 2010, when the company faced intense media scrutiny following a spate of worker suicides. Woo also said automation will be key to keeping labor costs under control in the long-term, according to Reuters, and that the company would have robotic arms complete mundane tasks currently done by workers. Foxconn later, however, sent a clarification to media outlets strongly denying that layoffs are a possibility or that automation would reduce jobs.  \u201cA media report that alleges that our company is reducing its workforce is completely inaccurate and totally without foundation,\u201d Foxconn said in a statement distributed by public relations firm Burson-Marsteller from Hong Kong. \u201cWe continue to recruit employees to support our business and operations globally and we continue to maintain a workforce of over one million employees worldwide.\u201d  On automation, Foxconn said: \u201cAs we have long said, Foxconn is investing in the automation of many of the manufacturing tasks associated with our operations \u2026 to enable our employees to focus on high value-added elements in the manufacturing process.\u201d The company added: \u201cAs we continue to increase the application of automation in our operations, the magnitude of our employee recruitment is expected to decrease in the years ahead, but we have no plans to reduce our workforce numbers now or anytime in the future.\u201d Foxconn revenue grew by double digits from 2003 to 2012, but recently tumbled to to 1.3% in 2013 and 6.5% in 2014.

After scandals and worker complaints, Apple, which is Foxconn\u2019s largest customer, allowed the Fair Labor Association to conduct a review of its suppliers\u2019 labor practices. The FLA interviewed \u201cthousands of employees about working and living conditions including health and safety, compensation, working hours and communication with management\u201d, per Apple, and the result was better living conditions, higher wages and fewer suicides.  Last summer, Chairman Terry Gou, Foxconn\u2019s largest shareholder, urged other shareholders to \u201cbe patient, don\u2019t be in a hurry\u201d about the company\u2019s potential evolution beyond making iPhones.

The film is currently in pre-production in Taipei ahead of the shoot beginning in the coming weeks, with the accident happening at the CMPC studio complex. Two other men were injured. A spokesman for the film released this statement:  Today there was an unfortunate accident at CMPC Studios in Taiwan, where the Martin Scorsese film, Silence, is in pre-production. An existing structure on the CMPC backlot had been deemed unsafe by the production, and accordingly a 3rd-party contractor was hired to reinforce and make it safe prior to any production-related work commencing in this building. Sadly, during this process, the ceiling collapsed, resulting in the death of one of the contractor\u2019s employees and injuries to two others. Everyone is in shock and sorrow and expresses their deepest concern and sympathy to the families of the individual who died and those who were injured.  Silence is based on a 1966 novel by Japanese writer Shusako Endo, set in the 17th century, about a pair of Jesuit priests who journey to Japan to investigate the alleged apostasy of another evangelist. They find a country where Christians are being terribly persecuted, and endure a battle of faith. It stars Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver and Ken Watanabe.           One person died and two were injured on Thursday when a ceiling collapsed on the set in Taiwan of Martin Scorsese\u2019s upcoming film Silence, the production said.     \u201cThe subject matter is very close to my heart,\u201d Scorsese told Total Film last year. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on it since I first read the book in 1989...

Nothing we tried seem to bring it back to its original sharpness. I bought him whetstones for Christmas, steels for his birthday, but nothing worked. And then I found an IO Shen knife sharpener, and everything changed \u2013 he got his knife back and started sharpening everybody else\u2019s \u2013 mine, his friends\u2019, his neighbours\u2019 \u2026 He felt like we were really on to something, so we imported a whole load of these machines and set about trying to sell them. A contract with Lakeland in Cumbria established us as stockists in the housewares industry. On a visit to the IO Shen sharpener factory in Taiwan, we found out that IO Shen knives are manufactured in a family-run factory in Japan. The location of the factory is secret \u2013 it took 10 years before we were allowed to visit. We were given a few samples which, at first glance, didn\u2019t look like much. They came in simple cardboard boxes with no branding and no handles. We worked with the manufacturers to devise a handle design and branding and packaging that would appeal to a more western customer base. We started to import the knives and when butchers and chefs in the UK tried them, they were amazed. Gradually, word spread from kitchen to kitchen. A knife\u2019s sharpness depends on the hardness of the steel, and IO Shen uses the hardest there is. The harder the steel, however, the more brittle the blade, so the knives have an outer layer of softer, protective steel around the central core of harder steel. IO Shen is one of only three manufacturers in the world who use this precise steel technology. Chefs don\u2019t make much money, but they deserve decent tools, so our knives aren\u2019t hugely expensive despite being costly to produce and painstakingly hand-finished. Our best sellers are two we\u2019ve imported since the beginning \u2013 a 21cm chef\u2019s knife in the traditional range, and the sahm khom from the Oriental range. We also do a range of specialist knives for filleting, sashimi, carving and boning. We also recently started tattooing blades \u2013 customising knives with messages and logos. I\u2019ve done song quotes, film quotes, some really saucy stuff, a scene from Blackadder\u2026 On a visit to the factory last April, my biggest priority was to try and reduce lead times but, walking around the factory, I watched a man hand-finishing a handle. I couldn\u2019t believe the time and care that went into his work. I went back to the meeting and took that point off the agenda. ioshen.co.uk"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/01/reading-world-confessions-literary-explorer-review-ann-morgan", "publicationDate": "2015-02-01T10:00:10Z", "tags": ["Travel writing", "Fiction in translation", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "sentences": ["The world consists of 195 or 196 countries at present, depending on whether you count Taiwan (Morgan does)."], "title": "Reading the World: Confessions of a Literary Explorer review \u2013 what literature reveals about a nation\u2019s identity", "article": "This book records the author\u2019s adventures over the course of a year in which she read a book from every country in the world. It is a personal survey of contemporary literature and how it relates, or doesn\u2019t, to national identity. It is also the story of a blog (ayearofreadingtheworld.com) that reveals the cybersphere in its best light: a forum for sane, intelligent debate. Morgan\u2019s project attracted comment, argument and suggestions from across the globe. Setting herself a weekly target of reading and blogging about four books, she had to fit the work around a full-time job, and her passion for the task sings from every page. \u201cThe richness of human variety,\u201d she writes at journey\u2019s end, \u201chad never been as real to me as it was that year.\u201d Reading the World is structured thematically around topics such as censorship, propaganda and translation. Apropos of the latter, Morgan writes of the difficulties created by \u201cthe presence of a third party in the text, crashing the cosy little author-reader t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate that can make the reading experience so delicious\u201d. Nicely put. I would have liked more on the nature of translation. Blog and book also cover distortion in the dissemination and availability of literature. In Brazil in 1987, 1,500 books by Anglophone authors appeared in translation, yet over the same period, only 14 books by Brazilian authors were published in English. \u201cA literary world designed by the writers and thinkers of a few nations,\u201d writes Morgan, \u201cis inevitably a space in which the work and influence of many important authors is diminished comparatively.\u201d She shows how hard it is to get published if you live in Palau, and the only \u201cbook\u201d she can find to read from San Marino is a 1976 tourist pamphlet. I liked the way the narrative travelled from Laos to St Vincent in a couple of pages, and I enjoyed the often bizarre nuggets that emerged from Morgan\u2019s immersion. The two most cited western creations that cropped up during a year reading the world? Sex in the City and Ikea. That said, there are problems. In an attempt to generalise, the prose can veer into the banal: \u201cPopular culture is so ubiquitous and homogenous that it\u2019s a joke.\u201d There are also errors. A single page contains three references to French author Raymond Querneau. This must be Raymond Queneau, whom readers of my generation will remember for Zazie dans le m\u00e9tro. The crucial list of the author\u2019s book choices comes at the end, as a kind of appendix. The world consists of 195 or 196 countries at present, depending on whether you count Taiwan (Morgan does). The function of lists such as these is to invite debate. Morgan\u2019s UK choice is a book written in Welsh, and America is represented by Neil Gaiman, who is British. Some selections are obvious \u2013 who was she going to pick for Albania except Ismail Kadare, and who from Bangladesh except standout contemporary novelist Tahmima Anam? But Mart\u00edn Kohan for Argentina? Reading the World is a treasure trove of new discoveries, and it is the smaller nations that beguile \u2013 anyone read a book from Vanuatu lately? The final list sent me to Uzbekistan, for example, and Hamid Ismailov\u2019s The Railway, brilliantly translated by Robert Chandler. Morgan could have included more on the pleasures of the texts themselves. The central idea here is perhaps more suited to a blog than a book. It is an ongoing, open-ended discussion about literature that benefits from input from others, and which develops its own threads and arguments organically. That said, those interested in the interface between nationality and writing will enjoy Reading the World. Reading the World is published by Harvill Secker (\u00a316.99).

Among the passengers were 31 mainland Chinese tourists travelling with two local travel agencies: Teyung Group and Flying Tours. Lin Liqing, manager of the Teyung Group, arrived in Taipei to help with the handling of the incident. \u201cWe are currently heading to the crash site and checking the passenger list with TransAsia Airways,\u201d Lin said. She added that the passengers had been sent to eight local hospitals. The manager of Flying Tours said that among 15 mainland Chinese tourists on the plane who were travelling with the agency, he had only confirmed one injured passenger \u2013 one of the two infants on board. He had no information on the remaining 14 people. On Wednesday afternoon the Taiwanese broadcaster TVBS showed rescuers pulling a toddler alive from the wreckage and rushing the child to safety. The chief executive of TransAsia, Chen Xinde, has publicly apologised for the crash.           Dashcam footage of the crash    Wednesday\u2019s crash is the second by a TransAsia flight within the past six months. In July 2014 TransAsia flight ATR-72 went down while attempting to land in the Penghu islands soon after a typhoon, killing 48 people. The cause of the crash is still being investigated. The flight\u2019s black box has been recovered, according to local media. \u201cWeather conditions were good and the pilot had 14,000 hours of flying hours and the co-pilot 4,000 hours,\u201d Lin Zhiming, a representative from Taiwan\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority, told reporters. The driver of the clipped taxi cab \u201chas been sent to a local hospital\u201d, an assistant to the Crown Taxi Company\u2019s general manager who identified himself as Mr Yang said. \u201cHe has a head injury and concussion but all of his vital signs are stable.\u201d Yang added that the company planned to raise the topic of compensation with TransAsia Airways at a later date. As a drizzle fell around nightfall on Wednesday, military crews took portable bridges to the scene, where rescue workers were building docks for easier access to the wreckage. About 300 rescue personnel and members of the media stood along the banks of the narrow river. Relatives of the victims were expected to arrive on Thursday, including some flying from Beijing.       ATR, a French-Italian consortium based in Toulouse, France, said it was sending a team to Taiwan to help in the investigation. Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at Flightglobal magazine in Singapore, described the ATR 72-600 as the latest iteration of one of the most popular turboprop planes in the world, particularly favoured for regional short-hop flights in Asia. It had a good reputation for safety and reliability and was known among airlines for being cheap and efficient to operate. \u201cIt\u2019s too early now to speculate on whether it was an issue with the aircraft or crew,\u201d Waldron said. The accessibility of the crash site should allow for a swift investigation and an initial report should be available within about a month, Waldron said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/05/malicious-apps-developed-in-us-study", "publicationDate": "2015-02-05T13:18:11Z", "tags": ["Data and computer security", "Apps", "Smartphones", "Tablet computers", "Technology", "Malware", "Mobile phones"], "sentences": ["\u201cWhile China, Korea, India and Taiwan generate a great number of malicious and risky apps, their combined total doesn\u2019t amount to that of the United States,\u201d claimed the report.", "Taiwan with 7% and Singapore with just over 4% are second and third in that chart, with only just over 1% of American-developed apps causing concern."], "title": "40% of 'malicious and risky' apps are developed in the US, study claims", "article": "More than 40% of \u201cdangerous\u201d apps on Apple and Google\u2019s app stores were made by American developers, according to a report published by online security firm Marble Labs.

Huang was one of 15 people who survived when the ATR 72-600 turbojet carrying 58 people crashed on Wednesday into a river soon after taking off. At least 32 people died. Huang said he helped four other passengers unbuckle their seatbelts after the plane crashed and began sinking in the water. \u201cI saw others were drowning,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I did not move quickly enough to help them, soon they would be dead.\u201d     Huang Jin-shun, a survivor of the TransAsia crash, and his son Huang Hu-sheng.

He recovered after receiving CPR, his uncle Lin Ming-yi told reporters. Moments before the plane banked sharply and crashed, one of its pilots called to the control tower: \u201cMayday, mayday, engine flameout,\u201d according to an aviation official who asked not to be identified. Flameout refers to a loss of combustion in the engine so that it no longer provides thrust. Causes can include a lack of fuel or foreign material getting into the engine. The airline and the Taiwan Civil Aeronautical Administration have declined to speculate on the cause of the crash, the latest in a series of disasters befalling Asian airlines.           The TransAsia plane clips a taxi on a motorway bridge before crashing into the river below.     The ATR 72-600 plane, less than a year old, had one of its engines replaced by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada in April 2014 before it went into service because of a glitch with the original engine, the airline said. The plane\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d flight recorders have been recovered. Video images of flight 235\u2019s final moments in the air captured on car dashboard cameras appear to show the left engine\u2019s propeller at standstill as the aircraft turned sharply, its wings becoming vertical and clipping a highway bridge before plunging into the Keelung river. The pilots\u2019 actions in the flight\u2019s final moments have led to speculation that they attempted to avoid high-rise buildings by following the line of the river and then banked sharply in an attempt to bring it down in the water rather than crash on land. The Taipei mayor, Ko Wen-je, praised pilot Liao Chien-tsung as a hero for having avoided crashing into buildings or major infrastructure. \u201cWe really have to thank that pilot,\u201d Ko said. \u201cHe really tried his hardest.\u201d Police diver Cheng Ying-chih said the underwater search for those still missing was being hampered by low visibility in the turbid river and cold water temperatures that forced divers to work in one-hour shifts. On Thursday about a dozen relatives of Taiwanese victims arrived at the riverbank to perform mourning rituals. Accompanied by Buddhist monks ringing brass bells, they bowed toward the river and held aloft cloth inscriptions tied to pieces of bamboo meant to guide the spirits of the dead to rest. Relatives of some of the 31 passengers from mainland China have arrived in Taipei on a charter flight. The Taiwanese president, Ma Ying-jeou, visited two Taipei hospitals to check on the condition of survivors and stopped at a morgue to comfort relatives of the victims, his office said. \u201cThis kind of air safety incident not only wrecks countless happy families but also affects trust in our tourism climate among tourists from outside Taiwan,\u201d the government said in a statement. \u201cWe must undergo this bitter experience and make all-out improvements.\u201d The ATR 72-600 is the most modern version of the plane manufactured by ATR, a joint venture between European plane maker Airbus and Italian aerospace company Alenia Aermacchi. About 1,200 of the planes are in use worldwide. ATR is helping with the Taiwan crash investigation. TransAsia Airways is Taiwan\u2019s third-biggest airline by fleet size after China Airlines and Eva Air.

The winner of the Golden Bear for the best film will be announced next week, with 19 films produced in 25 different countries going for the prize. The list includes the new Terrence Malick film Knight of Cups, starring Christian Bale and Natalie Portman.             The first major festival on the European circuit is known for premiering and celebrating the most challenging and original filmmaking, often at the cutting edge of cinema. This is reflected in the historic winners of the Golden Bear. Many of whom have since achieved cult status. In 1956 the the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des Associations de Producteurs de Films (FIAPF) accredited the festival and since then there have been winning directors from 28 different countries. Unsurprisingly, the United States has had the most winners - with nine, although European nations have also fared well. Put together, 38 of the 67 prizes have gone to filmmakers from countries that are now in the European Union.        There have also been winning directors from as diverse locations as Serbia, India, Hungary and Taiwan, which with Ang Lee is home to the only director who has won the award twice.  Despite the breadth of countries and a knack for awarding diverse genres, one aspect the Berlinale is in line with the broader film industry is the gender split of winning directors. Of the 67 awards given - so including the 16 years where multiple awards were given out - there have been 64 male recipients - or 95.5%.       The four women who have won the award include Hungarian M\u00e1rta M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, Bosnian Jasmila \u017dbani\u0107 and Soviet Larisa Shepitko (born in what is now Ukraine). The most recent female winner was Peruvian Claudia Llosa in 2009 with her film The Milk of Sorrow.             A trend over the past decade has been a move away from already established directors and towards films that received critical plaudits but then fared less well at the box office.  Between 1994 and 2004, winners, and their US box office takings*, included the following:  In the Name of the Father (1994) -$25m Sense and Sensibility (1996) - $43.2m The People vs Larry Flint (1997) - $20.3m The Thin Red Line (1999) - $36.4m Magnolia (2000) - $22.5m Spirited Away (2002) - $10.1m  However, in the past ten years only one film has reached anywhere near that level of success. Ashgar Farhadi\u2019s Iranian drama A Separation, which took $7.1m at the US box office.             The more niche selections have included C\u0103lin Peter Netzer\u2019s Child\u2019s Pose in 2013 and Bosnian Jasmila \u017dbani\u0107\u2019s Grbavica in 2006. Whether this trend continues with 2015\u2019s winner remains to be seen.

I only live round the corner from this place so there\u2019s no need to uproot the family or spend hours on the road.\u201d Having just returned from the Indian Super League, where he was voted player of the tournament, no less, after reaching the final with David James\u2019s Kerala Blasters, Hume is done with travelling for a while.

He enjoyed it so much he might be back again later this year, having signed only a six-month contract with Tranmere, but if the forward does return he intends to make sure his wife and daughters can at least visit. \u201cLast year everything happened in a rush,\u201d he says. \u201cI found myself out of contract for the first time in 15 years and I wasn\u2019t sure what to do. Friends suggested registering for the ISL because they were interested in players with international backgrounds, so I called them up and I was drafted. Like everyone else in this country I didn\u2019t know a thing about football in India, but I did know I wanted to play for someone. \u201cI\u2019m only 31, the game hasn\u2019t seen the last of me yet. I\u2019d had offers before from places like Taiwan, but they were for pennies, basically, and I was reluctant to go so far for so little. The ISL made more sense, particularly as there were other British lads in the team like Jamo and Michael Chopra. Leaving my family behind was the hardest part. I hadn\u2019t made any arrangements for visiting, not even when we reached the final.

It just wasn\u2019t feasible. If I do go again, and I wouldn\u2019t mind doing, negotiations are going on at present, we\u2019ll get the travel arrangements all sorted out in advance. That\u2019s the difference between knowing what to expect and taking a leap in the dark.\u201d No one knew quite what might happen in the first ISL season. Hume and his team-mates were initially worried about India\u2019s reputation as a cricket-mad country and afraid people might not turn up to watch football. \u201cWe were trying to reassure ourselves at first,\u201d he explains. \u201cTelling each other that with a population of 1.25 billion surely a few would come out to watch us. We needn\u2019t have worried. The average attendance was mid-30s, some games drew 60-70,000, the final was watched by a TV audience of millions. We went to one place early on and we were moaning a bit because there were only around 12,000 spectators. Only! It would be great to see Tranmere getting gates like that again.\u201d Not that much seems to have changed in the nine and a half years since Hume left Prenton Park for Leicester City, except that a club once pushing for promotion to the Premier League and capable of claiming sizeable scalps in cup competitions is now fighting for league survival at the wrong end of League Two. \u201cI hope I can help,\u201d Hume says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I hope we can get the crowds back up to around nine or ten thousand too.     Iain Hume pictured in 2001, during his first spell at Tranmere Rovers. Photograph: Mike Mayhew/Sportsphoto Ltd    \u201cI love being back here. Even six months is a big thing to me. Football is the only thing I\u2019ve ever wanted and been able to do, and Tranmere gave me my chance. Through my own fault I\u2019ve not got any education, no qualifications outside of playing football. I took a risk at 15 to come over here before finishing school in Canada. These guys gave me a start, and over 500 professional games later, 115 goals and 41 international caps [for Canada], I\u2019m grateful.\u201d Football has not always been good to Hume. The still livid cranial scar he makes no attempt to hide attests to the most notorious episode of his career, when he came off second best to Chris Morgan\u2019s elbow, Andy D\u2019Urso\u2019s ineffective refereeing and the FA\u2019s lamentably inadequate disciplinary procedure, and received scant compensation for a fractured skull suffered while playing for Barnsley against Sheffield United in 2008. It seems too trite to ask a player whose whole life was altered by a brutal foul whether he is over the incident yet \u2013 not everything fades with time \u2013 though there must have been some doubt over whether he could summon the confidence to play football again. \u201cThere were worries, but it was mostly my wife and parents who were concerned,\u201d Hume says. \u201cI knew I wanted to get back, not least because Barnsley had paid \u00a31.2m for me. I was out for nine months, then in my first game back, pre-season for Barnsley against Gainsborough, my first touch of the ball was a header. It had to be, didn\u2019t it? After that I was fine. Anyone who knows me will tell you I am not the type to shirk out of a challenge.         Sky Sports reporting that Chris Morgan will not face any further action for the elbow on Iain Hume.    \u201cSky tried to organise the next season\u2019s fixture [against Sheffield United] to be a literally a year after the event, almost on the anniversary, but they didn\u2019t quite get what they wanted. I was injured, he was suspended. I try not to hold grudges, you have to get on with your life, I don\u2019t have any feelings towards the player either way now.\u201d Hume\u2019s career took him to Preston North End, Doncaster Rovers and Fleetwood Town after Barnsley, then to the Kerala Blasters, but he still remains Tranmere\u2019s youngest ever debutant, at 16 years and 167 days against Swindon Town in 2000. So how did someone born in Edinburgh and raised in Canada manage that? \u201cI came over on tour with Canada Under-18s,\u201d he says. \u201cI was only 15. The last game we played was against Tranmere Under-18s. They asked about me, but didn\u2019t think they would be able to get a work permit. Then when they were told I was from Edinburgh and already had a passport they took my number. I wasn\u2019t expecting anything much because I had already been for trials in Scotland with St Mirren and Hearts. \u201cThey promised me the world and delivered nothing, which was disappointing because I felt I had done quite well at St Mirren, and Hearts was my boyhood team.

Yet both leaders made note of their concerns. Obama called for \u201cswift work\u201d to improve cooperation on cybersecurity, Reuters reported \u2013 for years, Washington has accused Chinese hackers of repeatedly targeting US institutions. Xi warned the US against \u201cunfavorable interference\u201d on the issues of Tibet and Taiwan, two perennial sticking points in the relationship. During the Sunnylands meeting, Xi spoke about a \u201cnew type of great power relations\u201d between the United States and China, implying that the two countries should regard one another as equals. Since then, the term has become a regular fixture in official speeches and in the state-run press. Obama, while meeting with Xi in November 2014, did not publicly mention the term once. \u201cOne thing that will always be important here is the state of the Chinese economy compared to the state of the US economy,\u201d Tsang said. \u201cIf the Chinese economy weakens, and the US economy continues on a robust trajectory, the conversation is going to be slightly different than if the US economy is slowing and the Chinese economy is strengthening.

On Thursday the Labour party pledged that if elected it would cap class sizes at 30 for pupils aged five to seven years. By contrast, last week the head of the OECD Program of International Student Assessment (Pisa) surveys, Andreas Schleicher, set out the seven big myths about top-performing school systems, with myth number four being that small classes raise standards. This can\u2019t be right, he argues, because high-performing education systems like those in east Asia focus on better teachers, not class sizes.   Related: Ed Miliband: Labour would restore Blair-era cap on class sizes    These two attitudes reflect opposite sides of a longstanding and angry debate which resurfaces at regular intervals. On the one hand we have teachers, unions, parents and some academics arguing that smaller classes allow better teaching and learning; on the other are many policymakers, politicians and advisers, as well as some academics, who argue that class size is not important. Despite the Labour party pledge, my impression is that this latter perspective is gaining ground. As well as the OECD, the view is reflected in the influential Sutton Trust toolkit, and in a number of weighty reports by, among others, McKinsey &amp; Company, the Grattan Institute, and the Brookings Institution. How do we reconcile these two different approaches? Are teachers wrong and self-serving, as some commentators imply? To address this question we need to examine the evidence on the relationship between class size and pupil performance. As someone who has researched this for some time, I am struck by how those in favour of larger classes rely on three main sources of data: cross-national comparisons, \u201cmeta-analyses\u201d and econometric analysis. Yet all of these offer only a partial view and are not conclusive on the causal role of class size. Results from Pisa are a case in point. These show that students in east Asian regions like Shanghai and Hong Kong do very well on school tests and also have relatively large classes; it is therefore concluded by many that class size is not important to academic achievement. But the flaw in this argument is that there are a host of reasons why high-performing Asian education systems do well, including high levels of parental support, cultural factors that favour education, and the prevalence of private tutoring. The causal effect \u2013 or not \u2013 of class size therefore cannot be inferred.    Class size does matter for the younger pupils in the first two to four years in school    So called \u201cmeta-analyses\u201d, such as the well-known one by professor John Hattie have also been persuasive. They involve large-scale statistical analysis of multiple studies which address the effects of class size. The conclusions have generally been that class size does not have a major influence on student learning. Yet often these analyses are based on studies of such varying quality, and with variable parameters \u2013 age of pupils and research design, for example \u2013 that it is difficult to arrive at sound conclusions. A similar problem exists with econometric analyses \u2013 studies by economists who often take measures of class size, or more usually pupil-teacher ratios (which is not the same thing), and develop statistical models of effects that take little account of what actually happens in school. Interestingly, these sources of data are all secondary analyses; that is, they use data collected by other people and are often not designed to study class size at all. What is needed are dedicated studies of class-size effects which carefully control for potentially confounding factors like pupil and teacher characteristics. There are very few such studies. Perhaps the two most reliable and large-scale ones \u2013 the Student/teacher achievement ratio (Star) experimental project from Tennessee, and the Class size and pupil adult ratio (CSPAR) longitudinal study, which I directed at the Institute of Education (IoE) \u2013 arrive at similar conclusions: class size does matter for the younger pupils in the first two to four years in school, and small classes are particularly beneficial for the more disadvantaged and initially lower-attaining pupils. It is sometimes argued that class sizes have to become smaller than 20 for any noticeable effect, but in the IoE study we were able to show that there was no such threshold; the effects of class size continued in a linear way across the range of class sizes. But in any case, the debate over class size has become tired and formulaic, and is hampered by significant limitations. One is that the focus on class size and academic performance overlooks the effect of class size on other aspects of classroom life, such as relationships, discipline and catering for pupils with special educational needs. Again, there are few studies, but careful moment-by-moment systematic observation of pupils shows that class size affects the amount of individual attention pupils receive, and their engagement and active involvement in class.    Class sizes and teaching are not mutually exclusive    In a recent IoE study we found that lower-attaining secondary pupils were more likely to be off task in larger classes when compared to middle- and high-attaining pupils. Intriguingly, in high-performing east Asian countries like China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, there has been a move recently to introduce smaller classes. This is not to improve academic attainment, but to help with a move from teacher-directed to student-centred approaches that aim to meet individual pupils\u2019 diverse educational needs, and to develop critical thinking and collaborative approaches. So performance on tests is not the only worthwhile educational outcome; there are other pupil outcomes and classroom processes that can be influenced by class size. The second limitation of much of this debate is that it sets up the issue as a binary choice: either invest in class sizes or in teaching. But these are not mutually exclusive. All teaching and learning takes place within a context, and one important feature of school classrooms is the number of pupils in a class. We can all agree that the quality of teaching is vital, but smaller classes can help teachers provide a more effective education. This is appreciated far more in east Asia than the west, as is the realisation that the benefits of class-size reduction will not happen automatically, but will require careful attention and professional development if we are to make the most of the opportunities that smaller classes offer. Instead of focusing on the relationship between class size and pupil attainment, we should be looking at the relationship between class size and effective teaching."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/21/gallery-visitors-fall-tate-national-gallery", "publicationDate": "2015-02-21T18:00:02Z", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Tate Modern", "National Gallery", "Society"], "sentences": ["I\u2019ve seen Rothko, it\u2019s always sensational \u2013 now show me what was being made in Taiwan or Rio or Beirut at the same time."], "title": "Fewer Brits are visiting our top galleries \u2013 should we be worried?", "article": "Jonathan Jones, Guardian art critic The news that both the National Gallery and Tate have lost part of their British audience is proof that, as a nation, we do not love art anything like as much as we pretend. Historically, ever since Thomas Cromwell led the dissolution of the monasteries, Britain has distrusted art. The word was valued much more than the image. Then in the late 20th century this appeared to change as we became renowned for controversial artists from Francis Bacon to Damien Hirst. Tate Modern opened at the turn of the century, seeming to confirm we are a nation of adventurous art lovers. So why are fewer Brits going to top galleries? Because there\u2019s once again a lack of belief in art in Britain. Creativity, the Warwick commission revealed this week, is being marginalised in schools. Our horizons are shrinking. For all the trendy art fairs, we are reverting to philistinism, increasingly conservative and intellectually numbed by trashy television. Art is too difficult for the Instagram generation. Kate Bryan, director of Art15, London\u2019s global art fair We love art! More people visit museums and galleries than attend premier league football matches. I am wary of jumping to conclusions about UK attendance levels for two reasons. Firstly, I think these figures are misleading and require a huge amount of investigation to avoid misinterpretation. How can Tate Modern be expected to sustain the extraordinary visitor numbers generated by the Damien Hirst show three years ago? The figures show a 3% decrease from UK visitors since that year but a 1% increase on the year before. I was at the Whitworth reopening in Manchester last weekend and the atmosphere was electric, a completely enthused public smashed all previous attendance levels. What does concern me though is the Warwick report, which paints a worrying picture of a future Britain where the arts are marginalised. I have lived in Hong Kong, a city playing catch-up with its art infrastructure post-handover. Not only is there a lack of content, there is a huge battle to generate audiences in a city with no history of arts education. JJ We definitely like to go to flashy art openings! And art fairs, above all Frieze, with its legions of desperately fashionable people. If cultural health is measured in how many Russian plutocrats buy art here, we\u2019re doing great. But what worries me \u2013 however the Tate spins those figures \u2013 is what lies behind the bustle and buzz of private views and the fun of Grayson Perry on the box. Are we really looking at art seriously, and learning to appreciate it more deeply? For me, art and education are the same thing. This is true for adults as well as children. I go to galleries to learn about art \u2013 the more I see, the more nuances I discover, the more deeply I can enjoy great art. If fewer British people are making use of our free public collections in that way, it means not so many of us are experiencing art in the serious, ennobling, civilised way that makes it matter. Because, frankly, if we make a fuss about art but don\u2019t put in the gallery-going that awakens us to the subtleties of Cezanne and the grandeur of Rothko, what\u2019s it all about, really? A quick footnote on the figures \u2013 according to Tate, it had 4,508,000 British visitors in 2008/9. In 2013/14 it had 3,551,000 British visitors. That is a drop of around a million people, is it not? The Damien Hirst exhibition is irrelevant because it happened in 2012. It does not explain at all why there were so many more Britons rushing to Tate in 2008 than now. KB I completely agree that art should be an experience for us all, regardless of how many private jets we own.The media are obsessed with auction results, which to me have nothing to do with artistic value, merit or education. In fact, it all seems to purposefully alienate the true value of art from the kind of audience we are talking about. For me, an important challenge to address is finding and developing new audiences, and not just for the same western artists. I\u2019ve seen Rothko, it\u2019s always sensational \u2013 now show me what was being made in Taiwan or Rio or Beirut at the same time. I\u2019m dying to break away, and I know others are too. You mention arts on the box \u2013 I think television has a vital role to play, and one that is not being fully utilised. We have less arts broadcasting in the UK at a time when it should be expanding and delivering new content to new audiences. As a judge on it I\u2019m clearly biased, but Sky Arts Portrait Artist of the Year managed to bring art to new audiences by rethinking the way it reached out. And that kind of programming, in turn, will increasingly impact on the future visitor numbers to our public collections. JJ I don\u2019t agree that you can look too many times at a Rothko \u2013 in fact that attitude may be part of the problem. Why always be moving on to the next thrill? The definition of great art is that it repays repeated looking. Rothko gets scarier every time. Caravaggio and Rembrandt and Vel\u00e1zquez, all on view for nothing at the National Gallery, become more magisterial the more often you look. But this kind of sustained calm encounter with art is the very opposite of today\u2019s nervy culture of quick infosnacks and photoshares. This has nothing to do with where the art comes from: Tate is a truly global institution, is it not? British people just don\u2019t like art as much as they pretend, on the whole. If we had taste, as a nation, Grayson Perry would not be famous, for no one who actually has a feeling for art can think his scratchy pots are well drawn. We really need to learn to look better, to open our eyes to the sensuality and truth of great art \u2013 and the best way to do that is by visiting our amazing free galleries as often as possible. KB I wish I were brave enough to say something as bold: that you can look too many times at a Rothko. I didn\u2019t, because you simply can\u2019t. Some of the most thrilling artistic encounters I have known have been with artworks I am very well acquainted with. But, for the sake of comparison, just because I deeply love one record it doesn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t constantly seek out new music. We need to nurture arts audiences and all be more forward-thinking by exploring new parts of the art world. It\u2019s not a new trend \u2013 look at some of the most significant developments in art history where contact with new cultures created shockwaves that resonated for decades after, not just for the artists but for the viewing public. Art is about sustained engagement but it is also about development, expansion and progress. It\u2019s too big a subject \u2013 probably even for the people busy in government trying to work it out \u2013 but what exactly is a British audience now anyway? The UK is formed by a diverse set of cultural identities \u2013 why should we all want to see the same things?

It reflects the broader growth of its aid program. \u201cAustralia still dominates in terms of the amount of aid, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing any kind of challenge to Australia\u2019s role in the region, and I don\u2019t think the Australian government should have any concerns,\u201d she said. \u201cBut China is having a large impact within Pacific Island communities and that\u2019s something Australia and New Zealand need to consider.\u201d The aid was mostly extended in the form of concessional loans, and went towards disaster relief and projects such as new dormitories at the University of Goroka in Papua New Guinea and the four primary schools in Gautavai, Samoa. Brant said it was difficult to link the aid to specific political objectives. China and Taiwan once competed to outspend each other in the region in order to secure diplomatic recognition, but have ceased doing since 2008 as their relations have improved. Mostly the increased spending was about \u201ccultivating an image of China as a responsible player and as a generous nation that is there to help out Pacific Island countries,\u201d she said. Australia\u2019s foreign aid budget was revised last January and again in the May budget for a total cut of around $7.6bn. Assistance to Papua New Guinea increased by $50m and Nauru\u2019s allocation also increased marginally, but programs in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Samoa, Fiji, Tonga and Kiribati all suffered cutbacks. Foreign aid was slashed again by $3.7bn in the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook budget in December to fund new national security measures."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/03/barbican-video-games-global-tour-art", "publicationDate": "2015-03-03T06:30:09Z", "tags": ["Games", "Game culture", "Technology", "Culture", "Barbican", "Art and design", "Retro games"], "sentences": ["There was understandable concern about whether such a highly interactive exhibition was technically feasible and if it would be a good experience for visitors.\u201d Thousands of visitors later, however, the institution saw the touring potential, and from 2003, the collection travelled the world, stopping off everywhere from Helsinki to Kaohsiung, Taiwan."], "title": "How the Barbican turned video games into a global arts tour", "article": "In 1998, one of the earliest employees of Rockstar, the studio behind the blockbusting Grand Theft Auto series, was chatting with the director of the National Museums of Scotland when he suggested something relatively new: an exhibition of video games. The scale and the complexity of the task looked daunting though, so the duo \u2013 Rockstar\u2019s Lucien King, and Sir Mark Jones, now master at St Cross College, Oxford \u2013 sought help. The Barbican answered.  The result was the 2002 exhibition Game On, which packed the Barbican\u2019s gallery with hundreds of vintage arcade machines and computers. I wrote about it at the time, inspired by King\u2019s enthusiasm; and when I visited just after opening it was astonishing to see artefacts like an old PDP-10 mainframe and the original Pong cabinet. This wasn\u2019t the first example of a major cultural space embracing games. The American Museum of the Moving Image began its Hot Circuits: A Video Arcade exhibition in 1989 and toured it around the US for the next five years. Japan also saw a number of exhibitions through the 1990s. But 13 years ago, it was certainly rare \u2013 especially for a general arts venue like the Barbican. The organisers were far from sure about how it would go.             \u201c[In 2002] we realised that a big survey show of video games had not been attempted within a cultural organisation and with games being in its ascendency, both in terms of popularity and game criticism, the timing seemed perfect,\u201d recalls Neil McConnon, head of Barbican International Enterprises. \u201cThe exhibition was a risk because nothing similar had been done before. It seems quite obvious to us today that video games have had an impact on contemporary culture, but at the time of the first Game On exhibition in London, this was far from clear. There was understandable concern about whether such a highly interactive exhibition was technically feasible and if it would be a good experience for visitors.\u201d Thousands of visitors later, however, the institution saw the touring potential, and from 2003, the collection travelled the world, stopping off everywhere from Helsinki to Kaohsiung, Taiwan. At most stops, locally relevant instalments are added, exploring regional development cultures, and since 2010, the Barbican has been running a refreshed version \u2013 Game On 2.0 \u2013 which features brand new elements looking into 3D stereoscopic visuals, virtual reality and other emerging technologies. This year, the updated version is coming to the UK for the first time, taking up residence for five months at Newcastle\u2019s Life Science Centre from 23 May. So why did the exploration and celebration of gaming culture become such a lasting element of the Barbican\u2019s output? There\u2019s obviously the revenue generated by touring an exhibition that\u2019s been seen by over one million visitors. But, in cultural terms, why should museums and galleries house coin-op machines and consoles?  \u201cIt is very important for both arts centres and video games,\u201d says McConnon. \u201cFor video games, being part of a broader cultural context will hopefully offer creators access to a greater range of inspiration. It also reminds gamers and creators that the medium didn\u2019t evolve in a bubble; there are strong links to other creative media such as media art and post-internet art. Video games are designed by teams whose backgrounds and training span a range of subjects including fine art, design, animation and mathematics, programming etc... it\u2019s a broad skill set and it attracts the brightest and best in these fields. \u201cFor cultural institutions, recognising video games is part of the broader project of acknowledging aspects of contemporary popular culture as significant with important historical implications, as well as potentially reaching out to a broader audience.\u201d The message is getting out. The Smithsonian institute has its incredibly successful touring exhibition, The Art of Video Games; Moma has a range of video games in its permanent design collection; Tate Modern has commissioned several interactive apps around its collection and is currently running its TateWorlds project, converting several major works into Minecraft environments; the National Museum of Scotland is running a Game Masters exhibition; The Victoria and Albert museum appointed a resident game designer in 2013, and has games in its own collection, including Sonic the Hedgehog and Flappy Bird. According to Moran, the Tekniska Museet in Stockholm has started working on building a Scandinavian collection citing video games as heirs to the region\u2019s industrial history.  Video games draw from, and feed into, the contemporary cultural milieu. They inspire movie directors like JJ Abrams and Duncan Jones, they are a medium for artists like Cory Archangel and Harun Farocki, and they are increasingly a medium for highly personal self-expression. Intuitive development tools like Game Maker and Twine have made game creation accessible for all, resulting in offbeat, idiosyncratic and moving experiences like Papers Please, Actual Sunlight and Dys4ia.  Arguably, games have claimed the cultural indie scene from film and music. This is where outsiders choose to make art now. To reflect this transition, the Newcastle exhibition will feature an indie showcase, co-organised by trade body Tiga, allowing small studios to submit their games for inclusion. I\u2019m on the judging panel, helping to choose which works will be represented (deadline for entries is 4 March). It\u2019s an interesting move toward a wider inclusivity that other major exhibitions have already adopted: the Smithsonian and V&amp;A have both organised game jams based around their art collections, while the former has held indie-specific events to showcase challenging new titles.     A row of classic machines at the Game On 2.0 exhibition Photograph: Barbican    McConnon is adamant about the value of games, dismissing the argument that they\u2019re just ephemeral entertainment with no worth in wider culture. \u201cLook at the huge range of professions drawn into making a modern video game: artists, musicians, writers, actors, programmers, game designers, to name a few,\u201d he says. \u201cCan the culmination of all these disciplines \u2013 all valued in their own right \u2013 when applied to one project really be said to add no enrichment to our culture? If that was true, other highly collaborative media, such as film, should surely answer the same charge?  \u201cFrom the terse simplicity of Tetris, the kinaesthetic pleasures of Mario and the deep world building possibilities of Minecraft to the environmental story telling of Bio Shock, games offer so many different types of experiences now, I think critics have simply yet to find what they like in the medium.\u201d It\u2019s a view reflected by a growing number of museums and galleries. Speaking to The Art Newspaper last month, the Smithsonian\u2019s curator of film and media arts, Michael Mansfield, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been important to us for some time, to represent games as this fantastic and unique expression amongst artists. There were [once] concerns about photography being a viable art form. I think one critic defined it as the bastard child of science left at the door of art. The same issue has been raised with video and performance art.\u201d Of course, what matters is that people interested in games are getting to see, hear and touch the history of the medium. We don\u2019t have to worry about whether games constitute art or not; it doesn\u2019t really matter. Their cultural impact is happening anyway, without anyone\u2019s permission.   Those classic Atari games were harder thank you think "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/09/apple-watch-launch-transformation-of-brand-luxury-goods", "publicationDate": "2015-03-09T19:01:46Z", "tags": ["Apple Watch", "Luxury goods sector", "Apple", "Technology", "Jonathan Ive", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Business", "Computing", "Asia Pacific", "China"], "sentences": ["Apple\u2019s staggering $18bn profit on $75bn of revenue reported in January came on the back of a 70% increase in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan compared with the same period a year ago."], "title": "Apple Watch release signals firm\u2019s transformation into luxury brand", "article": "For many Apple watchers, Monday\u2019s launch of its new watch is a significant step in the effort to turn the company into a technology-based luxury brand. The strategy was signalled initially with the hiring of Angela Ahrendts from Burberry a year ago to transform Apple\u2019s retail business. It has since been seen repeatedly in hiring from within the fashion and luxury-brand industries. But it will face its first new product test with the Apple Watch. Led by Apple design chief Sir Jonathan Ive, the 48-year-old British designer who is now effectively the face of the company after recent profiles in the New Yorker and US Vogue, Apple is placing new emphasis on design and style appeal. While the last iPhones came in a range of three colours, according to reports there will be no less than six metal options for the watch \u2013 notably including two types of gold, 18-carat yellow and 18-carat rose. There will be six band designs, two face sizes and 11 face designs. Chief executive Tim Cook has said the product will \u201credefine what people expect from a watch\u201d. Ive says it will be \u201ca move away from what is traditionally understood as consumer electronics\u201d. Ive hired industrial designer Marc Newson to work on the Apple Watch. An intimate of the fashion industry \u2013 his wife is Fendi and Victoria\u2019s Secret stylist Charlotte Stockdale \u2013 Newson choreographed the initial unveiling of the product for fashion designers and editors during Paris fashion week last September. \u201cThe fashion industry has an enormous amount to offer in what we do in industrial design because fashion is fast, fashion has its finger on the pulse,\u201d he told Women\u2019s Wear Daily. \u201cThere are very few creative industries that work on that rhythm.\u201d Apple has repeated that pattern since, throwing a celebrity-packed dinner in Paris hosted by Azzedine Ala\u00efa, the couturier who has dressed women from Madonna to Carla Bruni and Michelle Obama. The technology company also invited fashion houses to submit designs for the face of the watch, the theory being that fashion followers will want to parade their preferences with technology as they might with shoes or handbags. Apple also hired former Yves Saint Laurent chief Paul Deneve as president of special projects and Nike\u2019s former head of social media, Musa Tariq, as its digital marketing director.     Sir Jonathan Ive: \u2018Jon\u2019s always wanted to do luxury.\u2019 Photograph: Rex Features    Further emphasising Apple\u2019s interdependence on fashion branding, the watch launch in Cupertino, California will be staged, as it was in September, by Gainsbury &amp; Whiting, the London-based design firm behind the Alexander McQueen show Savage Beauty at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Within the industry, technology\u2019s growing relationship with fashion is seen as key to the acceptance of the new wearables. By some estimates, wearable technology could be worth $30bn (\u00a320bn) in sales by 2018. Last year, Google teamed up with the inventor of the wrap dress, Diane von Furstenberg and fashion website Net-a-Porter for the launch of Google Glass. Chip maker Intel has launched several fashion-orientated initiatives. \u201cWearable technology products have to become objects of desire,\u201d says Steve Holmes, vice-president of Intel\u2019s new devices group. All this also means that China remains key to Apple\u2019s strategy. The country is forecast to account for as much as half of global luxury goods sales by 2025. Apple\u2019s staggering $18bn profit on $75bn of revenue reported in January came on the back of a 70% increase in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan compared with the same period a year ago. More than a fifth of its worldwide revenues \u2013 $16.1bn \u2013 came from that region alone, making Apple the top selling smartphone maker in China. Credit for Apple\u2019s growth in Asia is given to Ahrendts, who placed growth in China \u2013 where Apple is subject to widespread black-market trade \u2013 one of her top three priorities. With a mandate to improve Apple\u2019s shopping experience, Ahrendts is rumoured to have hired Sir Norman Foster to redesign the firm\u2019s stores. Apple\u2019s reach into fashion with the Watch, its first new tech category since Steve Jobs\u2019s death, is no longer being dismissed as a novelty by traditional rivals. Experts predict that the Apple Watch will affect only the high end of the fashion-watch business, not the high-end luxury watch market. Still, there\u2019s no doubt the traditional industry is watching closely. With retailers expecting first-year sales of 20m Apple Watches, Tag Heuer and Swatch Group \u2013 which owns Breguet, Blancpain and Omega \u2013 are looking to introduce their own smartwatches. Fearing the iWatch trademark Apple was registering was too close to the iSwatch name of its digital-display model, the Swiss group has taken steps against Apple in countries where Apple had registered the name. While Apple looks for an edge by focusing on classic design and style, other tech manufacturers will doubtless follow. How far Apple is prepared go in repositioning itself as a luxury technology brand will be on view in San Francisco and on live stream across the world. Clive Grinyer, a friend and former colleague of Ive\u2019s, told the New Yorker: \u201cHe\u2019s always been a bit bling ... Jon\u2019s always wanted to do luxury.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/11/global-box-office-chappie-focus-jupiter-ascending-american-sniper", "publicationDate": "2015-03-11T15:21:15Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Chappie", "Will Smith", "Jupiter Ascending", "American Sniper", "Kingsman: The Secret Service", "Fifty Shades of Grey"], "sentences": ["Internationally, it seems to be doing slightly better in Asia, with No 1 openings in Malaysia ($1.1m), Taiwan ($814K), Indonesia ($757K) and Thailand ($701K) auguring better for appearances in tech-centric South Korea (19 March) and Japan (23 May)."], "title": "Forlorn Chappie looks to Asia to salvage box-office short circuit", "article": "The winner Improved news for our slightly shopworn fresh prince, as Will Smith and Warner\u2019s con caper Focus jumps to the global top spot, expanding from 32 to 50 territories. A flush of No 1 openings \u2013 in Mexico, Italy, Australia and Argentina \u2013 bolster the theory that Smith\u2019s primary constituency these days is overseas. More specifically, it\u2019s developing economies that are clinging, as with many an ageing A-lister, to the Men in Black star: openings are up from 2005\u2019s romcom Hitch (the comparison point used last week) in Argentina (Focus: $641K; Hitch: $154K), Czech Republic (Focus: $58K; Hitch: $34K) and Slovakia (Focus: $53K; Hitch: $10K); Russia, in its second week, was also ahead of the pace set by Hitch (Focus: $6.3m; Hitch: $2m). Contrast those with the Italian (Focus: $2.2m; Hitch: $2.5m) and Australian (Focus: $2.1m; Hitch: $2.7m) openings, and the UK running total (Focus: $6.5m; Hitch: $15.5m). Will\u2019s going to be clocking up a lot of unfamiliar passport stamps in the coming years, if those figures are anything to go by.   Related: Focus review \u2013 Will Smith and Margot Robbie in the perfect con movie, almost    No disassemble Neill Blomkamp\u2019s lobbying campaign for the directorship of the next Alien film has made his current work-in-play, Johannesburg-set robot parable Chappie, feel like a bit of an afterthought. And a wan $13.3m US opening \u2013 well behind $29.8m for Blomkamp\u2019s Elysium and $37.3m for District 9 \u2013 and $27m overall on a global rollout much more front-loaded than either of those two films is the pay-off. What did the real damage is the fact that, choosing to release post-Oscars but before blockbuster season begins proper, distributor Sony hasn\u2019t really backed the film. Flavourless trailers put antagonist Hugh Jackman \u2013 whose solo box-office appeal is debatable \u2013 high up the mix, amid a general splurge of techno-carnage. But they failed to showcase the film\u2019s distinctive elements: its South African \u201czef\u201d swagger, as represented in the persons of rappers Die Antwoord, and its thin but tangy lacquer of satire. It was partly the sense of a novel proposition coming from unfamiliar climes (in blockbuster terms at least) that pushed Blomkamp\u2019s debut, District 9, to a superb $210.8m on a $30m budget.           Chappie - video review    Films with robotic protagonists, surprisingly, have never done fantastically in the US, with just Wall-E taking over $100m. Given its opening weekend, it\u2019s unlikely Chappie will match either the new ($58m) or old ($109m, inflation-corrected) Robocop, or Short Circuit ($86.8m, inflation-corrected), its obvious progenitors. Internationally, it seems to be doing slightly better in Asia, with No 1 openings in Malaysia ($1.1m), Taiwan ($814K), Indonesia ($757K) and Thailand ($701K) auguring better for appearances in tech-centric South Korea (19 March) and Japan (23 May). And of course home turf South Africa (13 March) should be strong. Elysium lent on overseas markets \u2013 67.5% of its $286.1m gross \u2013 to make up for a so-so US performance; Chappie is in danger already of being a write-off, or at least on a reasonable $50m budget, a writedown.  Space wreckage           Jupiter Ascending - video review    Andy and Lana Wachowski\u2019s cosmic misfire, Jupiter Ascending, got a desperately needed turbo-boost a month after its day-and-date rollout: a belated $24.3m Chinese debut made it the week\u2019s biggest overseas earner. That\u2019s Warner Brother\u2019s fifth-biggest opening in the territory and gives it a fighting chance, like the studio\u2019s Pacific Rim, of joining that burgeoning fellowship: films that made more in China than the US (where Jupiter Ascending has taken $45m so far). Which will be the only accolade on the mantelpiece. With the film now up to $152m worldwide, profit remains light years away, with Deadline Hollywood quoting a true budget in excess of $200m plus $100m of marketing costs. With only Japan to come in terms of major markets, even $200m gross is an outside bet, making it a financial catastrophe of the order of Disney\u2019s John Carter, which took $284.1m on a $250m budget. Deadline\u2019s piece speculates interestingly on the Wachowskis being left unsupervised home alone after Jeff Robinov, the executive with whom they had the closest relationship, left Warner in 2013. With such a large financial burden, the casting also looks suspect, with Mila Kunis totally unproven as a lead and hot-right-now Channing Tatum possessing a stronger record in comedies and comedy-dramas. The sad thing is that a few more fiscal restrictions could have prevented a debacle that looks likely to end the big-budget career of a pair of creative mavericks. The Fifth Element\u2019s $263.9m in 1997 - $384.2 inflation-corrected \u2013 against $90m of outlay is the kind of space-opera business model Warner should have been aiming for. Kill shot           American Sniper - video review     Related: American Sniper set to become biggest film of 2014 at US box office    Two milestones for American Sniper, still lurking in the brush of the top 10 this week: it has now passed the $500m worldwide mark; and, with $337.2m of that in domestic gross at time of writing, has become the No 1 US film for 2014, passing the latest Hunger Games. It\u2019s the only non-franchised work on the list. Wherever you stand on the film\u2019s politics, that has to be a good thing. Italy ($23.1m), the UK ($20.5m), France ($16.8m \u2013 where it\u2019s holding strongly at No 1), Australia ($15.1m) and Japan ($12.2m) are the top overseas markets; currently at 14th on the global chart for 2014, it should pass Godzilla ($528.7m) and stick one place higher. In the upper echelons, only The Lego Movie (55%) and Divergent (52.3%), and 22 Jump Street (58%) \u2013 franchise-openers and comedies never being the greatest travellers \u2013 come close to being as Yank-centric as Clint\u2019s film. The clue\u2019s in the title.            The rest of the world The Chinese new-year blockbusters were still hanging around the global top 10 for a third weekend, but a rare Russian film made an appearance this week. Dukhless 2, a sequel to Roman Prygunov\u2019s 2012 film about a new-Muscovite playboy who realises the error of his capitalist ways when he meets a comely revolutionary, took $3.7m, top spot there, and 19th globally. Lead actor Danila Kozlovsky, in the ensemble for the Weinstein Company\u2019s Vampire Academy last year, has one foot in the Hollywood door. Not included on the Rentrak list was Doraemon: Nobita\u2019s Space Heroes $5.3m bow in Japan \u2013 an amazing 36th big-screen outing for the time-travelling robot cat and anime icon.            The future Disney tries to maintain its princess chokehold with Kenneth Branagh\u2019s version of Cinderella dropping in about 30 countries \u2013 accompanied by a new Frozen short. That includes an unusual face-off opening weekend for the US and China, with fantasy material an increasingly strong performer in the latter. Liam Neeson tries to maintain a different sort of chokehold \u2013 one administered by a gruff yet buff father figure \u2013 as he reteams with Non-Stop director Jaume Collet-Saura for crinkly action-fest Run All Night, which gets a 10-country first weekend. Chappie and Focus add more sporadic territories. And in India, Anushka Sharma looks to build towards what \u2013 after playing second fiddle in international record-breaker PK \u2013 could be a big 2015. She produces and stars in road-trip thriller NH10, which looks more harrowing than the Bollywood average and could benefit from the debate around violence against women in the country generated by the ban on BBC film India\u2019s Daughter.

That\u2019s an extra 5 billion people on the planet in less than a lifetime (the global population was 3 billion in 1960). The dramatic growth is driven by more people surviving beyond childhood and having children of their own, so it should be a cause for celebration of development, right? Not everyone believes so, fearing that too many people will put unsustainable strain on resources. Humans are \u201ca plague on the Earth\u201d, says David Attenborough, nature documentary-maker and patron of NGO Population Matters. \u201cEither we limit our population growth or the natural world will do it for us. We keep putting on programmes about famine in Ethiopia. Too many people there. They can\u2019t support themselves.\u201d But is it fair to blame the poorest for straining natural resources? Or is it rather, as was Gandhi said, the world has enough for everyone\u2019s need, but not for everyone\u2019s greed? Celebrity statistician Hans Rosling, whose popular YouTube videos have powerfully visualised the issue, argues that we do not need to panic about population growth. \u201cThe average number of children in the world is 2.4,\u201d he says. \u201cThe number of children below eight years of age in India has stopped growing. The number of children in the total world has stopped growing. Most of the fertility transition is done.\u201d But Simon Ross, chief executive of Population Matters, disagrees. \u201cI think Rosling\u2019s complacency is wrong,\u201d he says. \u201cI think this is the issue that governments need to put a lot more money into.\u201d So will Attenborough\u2019s view that population growth is a disaster for the planet prevail, or Rosling\u2019s that it is a surmountable challenge? Either way, how will population growth affect development work and what are NGOs doing in response? Promote family planning The population of India, which is nearing 1.2 billion, has grown by that of the US since 1995 \u2013 and is projected to take over from China as the world\u2019s most populous country in 2028. Vivek Baid, founder of Mission for Population Control, which works in West Bengal promoting family planning, says India\u2019s population growth has meant the country hasn\u2019t benefited from its development. \u201cRapidly increasing population doesn\u2019t allow standard of living to go up in India,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t allow better medical facilities for the poor. It doesn\u2019t allow better food standards.\u201d He berates the government and the main political parties for not prioritising family planning. \u201cIt should be top priority because only family planning can help to improve standards of living for the poor.\u201d John Bongaarts, vice-president of the US-based Population Council, agrees that there needs to be more focus on family planning. \u201cIn terms of demographic momentum, the first thing we need to do is to help women with their contraceptive needs,\u201d he says. \u201cImagine you\u2019re a woman in a rural area of Pakistan or Nigeria, it\u2019s very hard to find a reliable source of contraceptives. Providing access to contraception is a top priority.\u201d  A recent report from the Copenhagen Consensus, a group of economists that is calling for fewer sustainable development goals, said that for every $1 spent on family planning, there is a return of $120. In a worst-case scenario, development in the poorest countries will be seriously hampered by population growth, argues Maaike van Min of Marie Stopes International. Van Min works in the Sahel in sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the countries with rapidly growing populations are found. She fears that unchecked population growth could \u201clead to a continued cycle of poverty and lack of opportunities: child mortality will stay high, education will remain low, literacy rates will remain low and therefore economic opportunities will also remain low.\u201d   Related: Tomorrow\u2019s world: seven development megatrends challenging NGOs    She says NGOs shouldn\u2019t shy away from the subject. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot of taboo around the topic of fertility rates, family planning and contraception. It\u2019s difficult to say that in the future there will be too many people to sustain, but we need to be realistic on what women are already expressing that they need.\u201d Min believes the solution is relatively simple. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to do anything revolutionary, all we need to do is provide women who have already expressed the need for family planning with that option.\u201d In Senegal she found that sending teams to rural areas, working with the government and working with private healthcare providers all helped to improve access to contraception. \u201cWhat is key that we take the power away from the government and [put it] more in the hands of women,\u201d says van Min. \u201cWe can trust her to make a good choice.\u201d The countries that do succeed in reducing fertility rates can benefit from a demographic dividend, where there are more people in work than children to support. \u201cIf you have very rapid decline in fertility, the younger population is no longer growing so fast and the economy gets a boost because the number of workers per child goes up and that gives you a period of rapid economic growth,\u201d says Bongaarts. \u201cThis is what happened in the east Asian \u2018tiger\u2019 countries like South Korea and Taiwan in the 70s. China and India are currently benefiting from a demographic dividend.\u201d Prepare for the youth bulge A consequence of falling child mortality but continuing high fertility is a \u201cyouth bulge\u201d \u2013 a high population of young people. In Africa, because increased numbers of increasingly educated people has not been matched by jobs, this has led to significant youth unemployment. A young population offers a lot of potential for the development of a country, but only if their talents are realised through investment. \u201cWe like to think it\u2019s great to have a lot of young people because that could be a potential resource for productive engagement,\u201d says United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) economics adviser Michael Herrmann. \u201cIf all of these young people who are entering the labour market are productive it could give the economy a huge boost, but often there\u2019s a gap between what we expect young people to do and the investment that we\u2019re making.\u201d The solution is to equip youth in sub-Saharan Africa with 21st-century skills, says Michael Boampong, founder of NGO Young People We Care, which is headquartered in Ghana. \u201cOften you have a situation where you increase investment in education but when young people come out they are disconnected with what the industrial sector requires,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to prepare them so they have the employable skills.\u201d   Related: 2015 challenges: geopolitical shifts    NGOs can help by providing education and training and more, because investment in \u201chuman capital\u201d includes all aspects of development work, says Herrmann. \u201cInvesting in human capital starts with nutrition at the earliest childhood. It includes sexual and reproductive health.\u201d But this investment \u201cis well beyond the capacities of the poorest countries ... It\u2019s a call for development aid.\u201d A connection is often made between large numbers of unemployed young people and social unrest, even terrorism. But Herrmann says it\u2019s important not to overplay this. \u201cIt almost makes it sound as if young people are a danger in themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cEvidence doesn\u2019t support that. If there are a lot of young people and we don\u2019t provide them with opportunities, you might have a backlash. But I wouldn\u2019t say that more young people equals inevitably social unrest.\u201d Boampong says it is crucial that young people are listened to. Young People We Care encourage inter-generational dialogue between the youth and policymakers. \u201cCurrently one of the challenges we have in Africa is that there\u2019s a disconnect between young people and governments,\u201d he says. \u201cGovernments that are very disconnected with the young find themselves in situations like the Arab Spring. \u201cGovernments often see young people as a threat. They should try and maintain a closer connection to the youth.\u201d Governments need to involve young people in decision-making, provide jobs, and be transparent about what they are doing to reduce corruption, says Boampong. Encourage long healthy lives Another global demographic shift is ageing populations in developed countries such as Japan and Germany, and also in advanced developing countries. \u201cIn countries as diverse as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Mongolia and Vietnam, the population over age 60 will triple by 2050,\u201d William A Ryan wrote in an article for the UNFPA. \u201cThe growing health care and social support costs associated with ageing will pose tremendous challenges.\u201d In response to these changing populations, NGOs need to focus on preventing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in order to ensure older people are healthy. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about life expectancy, it\u2019s about healthy life expectancy,\u201d says Toby Porter, chief executive of HelpAge International. \u201cAt the moment most development health is orientated towards infectious disease control, which is important, but aging populations means higher rates of NCDs. We need better regular monitoring of blood pressure. For example, undiagnosed hypertension is still responsible for more preventable deaths and avoidable disabilities than any other single cause around the world.\u201d Herrmann says that society will need to respond to a higher population of older people by redesigning pension systems and making sure that they continue to be positively engaged in their communities. But he adds that we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the fact that ageing populations are a cause for celebration. \u201cPopulation ageing is a positive thing. It means we have had success in investing in people. It means development has taken place.\u201d How do you think demographic shifts will affect the way NGOs work?

He asked the question in writing this time, to new commissioner Rob Manfred, just as he did to Manfred\u2019s predecessor Bud Selig and Fay Vincent before him. Obviously, neither of the previous two commissioners ruled in his favor \u2013 Selig postponed making any decision at all on the matter \u2013 but at the very least, Rose has to have figured that there can\u2019t be any harm in trying the new boss. Especially when he\u2019s already a bit out there with some of his other baseball opinions. Rose has every right to ask, of course. But the answer should be a resounding \u201cno\u201d.Pet Rose was banned from baseball for life, and banned for life he should remain. There is a reason that the infamous Rule 21(d) \u2013 the provision of MLB\u2019s codified rules on sports gambling that specifies that any person who bets on a game in which, in the rule\u2019s words, \u201cthe bettor has a duty to perform\u201d \u2013 remains the only one-strike lifetime ban provided for under major league bylaw. There is a reason that rule is posted publicly in every clubhouse across the county. That reason is that the very fact of gambling on an outcome is anathema to a fair process. Sports betting scandals destroy professional sports leagues. We don\u2019t even need to look to other sports to see that this is true; the Taiwanese professional baseball league, the CPBL, is still trying to recover from the arrests made in connection to a 2009 investigation into a game-fixing ring that implicated players on the country\u2019s most popular team, the Brother Elephants, as they lost the championship series to the Uni-President 7-11 Lions in seven games. The league had seen an increase in average attendance in 2009; it saw attendance shrink by 28% in 2010. This is not a new problem for the Taiwanese league, either: scandals in 1996 and 2005 also rocked fan faith that the games they were seeing were untainted by organized crime influence. Obviously, lifetime bans haven\u2019t been enough to dissuade those who would fix matches in Taiwan \u2013 other, more pro-active action is required for that country, and the culture and climate surrounding the sport and its players has to change. But there is no evidence whatsoever that this same culture exists in MLB clubhouses. And there is no excuse to give it any grounds in which to prosper by signalling betting scandals can be forgiven if enough time has passed, or if that player or manager was good at their job when they weren\u2019t gambling on the fate of their team. Which brings us to the most contentious part of all this: Rose\u2019s assertion that he never bet against his team. It\u2019s an assertion that gets held up constantly in this discussion as a sign of Rose\u2019s good faith even as he broke MLB rules, and that he wasn\u2019t engaging in the actual activity that Rule 21(d) exists to countermand. First off, doubt surrounds Rose. It simply doesn\u2019t scan that someone with such profound gambling problems as Rose had \u2013 and there is no way to describe being compelled to engage in activity that you know will ruin your livelihood and reputation if found out as anything other than \u201ca problem\u201d \u2013 would somehow find within him the restraint to tame his habit on days when he thought his team stood a good chance of losing. This doesn\u2019t mean he actively set his team up to lose some games \u2013 merely that it\u2019s unlikely a man with a gambling problem was able to choose with ironclad specificity when and when not to feed his addiction. Secondly, it\u2019s common sense that \u201conly betting on the Reds to win\u201d enables just as much distortive behavior as betting on them to lose would. When to use a relief pitcher, and which relief pitcher to use, is the most crucial balancing point here: while it\u2019s not as hurtful to a team\u2019s health to treat a random day game in June like Game 7 of the World Series, Rose\u2019s bets for the Reds certainly would have tempted him to manage as if that were the case. And as the gambling world became more and more familiar with the fact that Rose was in fact betting on his team, they also learned, therefore, what it meant when Rose wasn\u2019t betting for his team. In the end, one suspects this is mainly about what it\u2019s always been about for Rose, at least ever since he was banned from the sport for life: money. Rose pays his bills these days in large part by signing autographs, and his reinstatement and following selection to the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee would allow him to bump up the price of an autograph by anywhere between $20 to $50. And while Rose might have signed more autographs than any other single person currently alive on planet Earth, you can be sure at least at first there would be no small demand for a copy of his autograph with a \u201cHall of Famer\u201d inscription preceding it. Rose\u2019s entire post-managerial career has been one attempt after another to cash in on what was left of his credibility and fame; there\u2019s no reason to believe this should be any different. In the end, that\u2019s what should seal the deal, here: Rose\u2019s greatest remorse isn\u2019t that he damaged the integrity of the game, but that he damaged his own brand. He just realized what that meant far earlier than the rest of us. Rose committed the ultimate crime against his sport, and he should have to live with what that\u2019s done to him and his marketability. It is not Rob Manfred\u2019s obligation, nor would I argue is it his job, to fix that for him."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/24/hm-to-open-more-international-stores-as-profits-surge", "publicationDate": "2015-03-24T09:28:11Z", "tags": ["Retail industry", "Business", "H&M", "Fashion", "Life and style"], "sentences": ["In February it opened its first store in Taipei, Taiwan."], "title": "H&M pushes ahead with new stores amid disappointing sales growth", "article": "Swedish fashion retailer H&amp;M has reported better than expected first quarter profits as it pushes ahead with rapid international expansion.

Last year it opened 379 outlets and this year\u2019s expansion plans would push the number of stores worldwide to around 3,950. The retailer is pushing into new markets including Peru, Macau, South Africa and India. In February it opened its first store in Taipei, Taiwan. The company intends to unveil a new flagship store on Herald Square in New York next year, which will be one of its largest shops at 5,700 sq m. It opened one on Fifth Avenue last year, with the store front (and H&amp;M handbags) decked out in images of Jeff Koons\u2019 yellow Balloon Dog sculpture. Profits after tax were SKr3.6bn (\u00a3284m) in the quarter to 28 February, up 36% on last year and better than expected. However, H&amp;M warned that the strong dollar would drive up its sourcing costs this year. The retailer makes most purchases in dollars but a large chunk of its sales are in euros, and it reports its results in Swedish krone. Analysts fear this will hurt profit margins. Sales in local currencies were up 9% in the first three weeks of March, which analysts described as disappointing, after climbing 15% in the first quarter.

Zoos belonging to the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (Waza) have been filmed over the past five years making animals perform dangerous tricks, confining them to inadequate premises and beating them, contrary to Waza\u2019s code of ethics, which demands the \u201chighest standard of animal welfare\u201d. In November, an animal keeper at Mysore zoo in India was filmed beating an elephant, and Taman Safari in Indonesia runs a travelling dolphin circus in which dolphins are forced to jump through flaming hoops. Tourists are also able to pose with tigers for photos. Zoo Negara in Malaysia has been condemned by a local MP for the terrible condition of its animals, and Dehiwala Zoo in Sri Lanka has come under fire after the deaths of a hippo, a lion and all the zoo\u2019s penguins. The zoo has also been criticised for an elephant show in which handlers threaten the animals with sticks to make them do tricks.  A manacled performing elephant has been filmed at Dusit Zoo in Bangkok, and Almaty zoo in Kazakhstan and the National Taiwan Aquarium have been accused of housing bears and beluga whales, respectively, in sub-standard enclosures. In 2009, a South Korean TV show filmed a small, terrified bear being placed inside a tiger enclosure at Everland Park. All these zoos are members of Waza, a Switzerland-based organisation that acts as the peak member body for the world\u2019s zoos. As revealed by the Guardian, Waza is being taken to court by an Australian conservation group over its alleged complicity in the infamous dolphin hunts in Taiji, Japan.    Related: World's top zoo organisation accused of links to Taiji dolphin slaughter in Japan    Waza\u2019s code of ethics states that where animals are used in performances by zoos, they must \u201cfocus on natural behaviour\u201d and \u201cnot demean of trivialise the animal in any way\u201d. It states: \u201cWaza and its members should make all efforts in their power to encourage substandard zoos and aquariums to improve and reach appropriate standards. If it is clear that the funding or the will to improve is not there, Waza would support the closure of such zoos and aquariums.\u201d Despite these stipulations, Waza has confirmed that no zoo featured in the videos of alleged cruelty has been expelled, or publicly or privately condemned.  Waza has more than 300 individual zoo members, including London Zoo, the Zoological Society of San Diego, Toronto Zoo, Bronx Zoo and Melbourne Zoo. Sarah Lucas, head of Australia for Dolphins, which is leading the court action against Waza, said the organisation was too closely wedded to the interests of its members. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to find abuses in these zoos \u2013 elephants being beaten or bears being kept in tiny, grimy cages \u2013 but Waza doesn\u2019t call out its members on any of these abuses,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to form the view that Waza is an organisation that protects its members\u2019 interests above that of the animals. \u201cMany of the zoos and aquariums do take the code of ethics seriously, but there\u2019s clearly a significant number that don\u2019t and Waza itself doesn\u2019t take it seriously. They need to enforce it, to take action. They\u2019ve either got to do their job or stop pretending to be a policeman for zoos and aquariums.\u201d Lucas said Waza\u2019s dual role as a voice for zoos and a conservation organisation was \u201cinherently conflicted\u201d. Waza has previously expelled zoos for breaches of conduct, such as Johannesburg Zoo for the illegal importation of animals last year. A spokeswoman for Waza said it took \u201creputable and reasonable complaints\u201d very seriously. She said there had been no complaints over any of the examples of abuse highlighted by the Guardian, but that the man filmed beating an elephant at Mysore zoo had been fired.  The claims have raised concerns among Waza members, with one, Kolmarden Zoo in Sweden, weighing up whether to quit the organisation. The director of the zoo, Mats H\u00f6ggren, said he could not be part of the same organisation as the Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums, which takes dolphins from the Taiji hunt. \u201cWe can\u2019t be even indirectly associated, that\u2019s not possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel horrible about what\u2019s happening over there and we need to put pressure on Waza to do something. \u201cWe will wait a little longer but there needs to be something constructive or we will terminate our membership, for sure.\u201d H\u00f6ggren sits on the executive committee of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, and said it would also discuss Waza membership.

Well, put out the bunting and pop the party poppers: this is the sweetest of music to my ears. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m a precious, overindulged restaurant critic, it\u2019s that I\u2019m neurotic: the idea that I&nbsp;might not make it into dinner sends me into a panic. I also don\u2019t do&nbsp;spontaneity, much as I\u2019d love to: I&nbsp;don\u2019t live anywhere near 99.9% of the restaurants I review. Where New York leads, London \u2013 and the rest of&nbsp;the UK \u2013 frequently follows. All digits crossed for an end to standing in line with a gazillion twenty-somethings whose circulation clearly works better than mine. \nYet here I am again, in a place that&nbsp;doesn\u2019t take bookings, where the music is deafening and you\u2019re likely to teeter back out into the night fragranced with smoke (not, weirdly, from the barbecue). Despite&nbsp;turning up ludicrously early,&nbsp;all the nicest tables at the front are reserved. I&nbsp;thought you didn\u2019t take bookings? \u201cSorry, madam,\u201d says the charming manager. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping those for the press.\u201d As ever, I\u2019m undercover and have to keep shtum. \nThe alternative is a tiny, gloomy room at the back, so we end up at the bar. I quite like eating at bars, pretending I\u2019m in Bushwick, but to navigate these stools you need legs like Alek Wek\u2019s to avoid looking like a hippo rogering a crane. We\u2019re welcomed with one of my favourite things, the mansplaining of \u201cthe concept\u201d: Mexican Korean BBQ, should you wonder, and once you\u2019ve finished wondering, should you fancy having a bit of a sneer. So&nbsp;why do I report back on B\u00f3 Drake with sunny bonhomie, happy to go back tomorrow, happy to recommend; in&nbsp;fact, just generally happy? \nThe answer, mostly, is ribs. Beautiful ribs. Ribs are one of those dishes that people mistakenly regard as easy trash food, having endured horrible versions in pubs and chains, the meat sweaty and flopping exhaustedly from the bones, the connecting tissue strained and shiny, the sauce like something coughed up by a Haribo-addicted pipe smoker. Good ribs aren\u2019t easy to do: they require time, skill, TLC and excellent produce. B\u00f3 Drake\u2019s tick all of these boxes: long wands of bone amply padded with pink-ringed meat; you need your teeth to tear it away from the bone, but there\u2019s smoky tenderness once you do. They\u2019re just sticky enough, gently sweet with Korean pear (those crisp, elegant creatures also known as nashi), lightly scattered with toasted sesame and tendrils of&nbsp;green chilli. \nThe folk behind B\u00f3 Drake include ex-Roka, Scottish-Chinese Jan Lee, and the joint shares with Roka a feel for meat and big flavours. Perhaps our bar perch leads us to order eccentrically, almost dish by dish, but&nbsp;I\u2019d argue this is the best way to experience the place; to use it like a&nbsp;less draughty version of Seoul\u2019s pojangmacha (plastic drinking tents) or LA\u2019s Korean-Mexican food trucks. The holy trinity of salt and fat and sweet pairs beautifully with booze, even if&nbsp;my sorta-negroni \u2013 in a tiny Kilner jar with an infuriating, golf-ball-shaped ice cube, the kind that always end up banging me on the nose \u2013 is little more than a couple of&nbsp;oversweet thimblefuls; daft name, too. B\u00f3 Drake marmelade \u2013 purlease. I should have stuck to the soju, theatrically zhuzhed up with a&nbsp;Professor Branestawm-worthy smoker that wreathes us in clouds of bamboo smoke. \nSo we order appetisers (\u201csmalls\u201d, ugh): quesadillas stuffed with gooey cheese and some fine, fruity, home-fermented kimchi. These come with a deceptively cooling chipotle cream with a ballsy after-kick. There are taro crisps with an uninspiring habanero-avocado dip, a bit Old El Paso for my liking. Vegetables don\u2019t miss out on the fusiony treatment: asparagus roasted with soy and yuzu; cauliflower, fried, with the earthy thrum of mushroom puree and red cabbage, and topped with translucent crisps of lotus root: good, but a tiny serving for a fiver. \nI\u2019d prop up the bar for hours on a promise of the brisket bao: a thinner, toastier version of the fashionable Taiwan-style buns, stuffed with slow-smoked beef, thinly-sliced pickle, frilly onion rings, a mustardy sauce \u2013 a Big Mac for the beardy generation.

Too many of the restaurants serve claggy, poorly executed food served by waiters with interpersonal skills that make traffic wardens look like first-class airline stewards. And yet, in the last decade, Chinatown has steadily improved. A growing appetite for and understanding of China\u2019s regionalism has been met by restaurateurs offering the thrilling cooking of provinces such as Sichuan, Hunan and Xinjiang, alongside the food of Taiwan, rather than just a sloppy approximation of Cantonese.   Related: Big trouble in little Chinatown as rent rises force restaurant owners out of West End    It would be a crying shame if all this real progress was stopped in its tracks by heavy-handed landlords seemingly with their eyes only on the bottom line. Historically, British restaurant-goers have always been less willing to pay serious money for \u201cethnic\u201d food than for European. As a result, central London\u2019s Chinese restaurants \u2013 and its Indians and Thais \u2013 tend to be high-volume, low-margin operations leaving little wriggle room when it comes to swallowing an increase in the overheads. And when long-standing businesses are forced out, it has a wider, negative impact on the area as a whole. But to portray multibillion-pound property firms as merely unscrupulous businesses with their eye on nothing but the bottom line is to oversimplify things. In truth, much of what\u2019s happening is just brutal economics, rent hikes reflecting the demographic and financial changes that have taken place across the capital in the past 10 years. But the landlords don\u2019t always sell to the highest bidder; they talk regularly of creating attractive \u201cestates\u201d.   Related: The Observer view on the threat to London\u2019s Chinatown: its loss will be no one\u2019s gain | Observer editorial    Outside London, independent landlords may well be in thrall to the mid-market chains, but in Soho, Chinatown and the surrounding areas, chain operators are regularly rejected in favour of independents more likely to improve the general mood of an area. All well and good, but alongside the values of \u201chipness\u201d, \u201cattractiveness\u201d and \u201cvibe\u201d, there must also be a responsibility to community. In my south London neighbourhood of Brixton and Herne Hill, businesses housed for decades in railway arches are fighting an attempt by their landlord, Network Rail, to force them out in the name of a refurbishment programme, with the prospect that when they return, their new rents will be unsustainably high. Network Rail promises to bring in only independent businesses, but that\u2019s not the point. Existing businesses have supplied cheap food and services to the local communities for decades. They are its beating heart. Replacing them with glossy, upmarket shops, however independent, will rip out that heart and character for ever. It\u2019s a story repeated across Britain\u2019s high streets, and its quickly gentrifying inner-urban neighbourhoods. Just as in Chinatown, landlords have to recognise that with their multibillion-pound property portfolios comes a responsibility \u2013 one that goes far beyond that to their shareholders."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/29/adam-driver-lots-things-said-about-face-interview", "publicationDate": "2015-03-29T08:30:00Z", "tags": ["Adam Driver", "Film", "Girls", "Martin Scorsese", "Noah Baumbach", "Culture", "While We're Young", "Star Wars: The Force Awakens"], "sentences": ["When I speak with Driver on the telephone, he\u2019s in Taiwan, filming Martin Scorsese\u2019s Silence, in which he plays a Jesuit priest."], "title": "Adam Driver: \u2018Lots of things have been said about my face\u2019", "article": "Adam Driver, 31, is the Emmy-nominated star from the HBO series Girls, in which he plays Hannah Horvath\u2019s (Lena Dunham) on-off love interest Adam Sackler. As Sackler, Driver combines memorable looks (6ft 3in frame, raven hair, a face like human origami), with an intensity that seems part apocalyptic internalised rage, part brittle vulnerability, part no-nonsense brio, leading many to cite him as a new kind of modern screen male. Driver was raised in Mishawaka, Indiana, by a paralegal mother and Baptist minister stepfather. After 9/11, he joined the US marines, but before being deployed to Iraq he broke his sternum during an exercise and was medically discharged. Driver has since founded the non-profit organisation Arts in the Armed Forces, which performs theatre for military personnel. Driver won a place to study drama at New York\u2019s Juilliard School, where he met classmate Joanne Tucker, whom he married in 2013. He\u2019s been cast in films such as Inside Llewyn Davis and JJ Abrams\u2019s forthcoming Star Wars: The Force Awakens. When I speak with Driver on the telephone, he\u2019s in Taiwan, filming Martin Scorsese\u2019s Silence, in which he plays a Jesuit priest. His latest film is Noah Baumbach\u2019s black comedy While We\u2019re Young. What\u2019s it like being directed by Martin Scorsese? Surreal. I grew up watching his movies. In my culture, in Indiana, it was all about going to Blockbuster Video and renting Martin Scorsese movies. So to get to work with him is pretty surreal. It\u2019s suddenly gone from watching as an audience member to feeling like a participant in a way that\u2019s pretty exciting. With projects such as Silence and Star Wars, do you feel a gravitational career pull from indie to the mainstream? I\u2019ve been fortunate to do things in both worlds so that\u2019s been interesting. There\u2019s no set plan, or feeling pulled to do anything other than getting to work with really good people. While We\u2019re Young has definitely got an indie feel to it. I worked with Noah before on Frances Ha. I think he\u2019s fucking brilliant! I could work with him on anything. All these great directors, like the Coen brothers, Scorsese and Noah, obviously they have different ways of working, but they\u2019re all specific \u2013 they know what the story is. At the same time, they surrender to not knowing when it comes to actually doing it. So they surprise themselves. They\u2019re not rigid? Yeah, they don\u2019t come in with the right answer. In While We\u2019re Young, an older blocked documentary maker(Ben Stiller) and his wife (Naomi Watts) get involved with a younger hipster documentary maker (Driver) and his wife (Amanda Seyfried). At first, the older couple feel that they can learn from the younger bohemian couple, but then it turns sour. There seems to be a battle going on between old-school authenticity and phoney culture?           The film team review While We\u2019re Young     Yes, that\u2019s a big theme of the movie. When I first read it, the character I related to most was Josh. I love watching Ben Stiller playing him, but also I believe in so much of what he preaches. I believe in creating history with something \u2013 not just being connected to the internet, and appropriating things and adopting history. But my character, Jamie, can take that interconnectiveness and make something pretty great, pretty fast. He\u2019s unprecious and by operating on impulses he\u2019s creating something, getting it out there. That\u2019s why it\u2019s such a good script. It argues both sides pretty well. You\u2019ve spoken before about how you worry about the culture of instant gratification among your generation, specifically regarding the Internet. Yes, you have information at your fingertips, but there\u2019s something about going through all the steps, as painful as the process is. And I\u2019m not by any means immune \u2013 I\u2019m completely susceptible. I think we\u2019re almost too interconnected, with no emphasis on putting in the time, because there\u2019s an expectation in the culture that things will happen immediately. Your breakthrough character, Adam in Girls, was widely judged to be a new kind of young male. Did you see him as a boy or a man initially? I\u2019ve never thought of him as a boy or a man. I think of him in moments. I don\u2019t think that he thinks of himself as a boy or a man either \u2013 he probably thinks of himself as \u201cin process\u201d.     With Lena Dunham in Girls. Photograph: c.HBO/Everett/REX    There was a mad energy about Adam at first. Recently, he\u2019s seemed slightly tamed \u2013 not so much domesticated as less feral? Hopefully he\u2019s changed. I think it\u2019s about him growing up, and putting his energy in different places. Adam had some graphic sex scenes (telling Hannah that she was 11 years old; urinating on her in a shower). For me, such scenes represented a jadedness among some modern young males \u2013 the saturation of readily available internet porn made them desensitised so they had to raise the erotic stakes to feel anything? This is not something that we talked about or made a conscious decision about. But I see what you\u2019re saying. Did the sex scenes ever make you feel uncomfortable? No, if it was just sexual things for the sake of being sexual, then that would make me uncomfortable, but it was part of the storytelling that Lena was going for. Did you feel empathy for how Lena Dunham was treated when Girls came out - the personal criticisms directed at her? Empathetic? Always, when a friend is being attacked. Lena is a grown woman and totally capable of handling it, way better than I would ever be able to. That\u2019s because she\u2019s thought it through and she\u2019s not just making arbitrary choices. That\u2019s the great thing about her writing \u2013 again it\u2019s specific and it\u2019s not for everyone. Some people get it, some people don\u2019t. That\u2019s par for the course with everything. She\u2019s more than capable of handling it. Do you consider yourself feminist in spirit? No\u2026 well, yes. But I don\u2019t go in for \u201cI am this\u201d or \u201cI am that\u201d. I read that you joined the marines because you were overwhelmed by feelings of patriotism after 9/11. That\u2019s why I initially joined. Then you forget your original reason for joining \u2013 it transforms into something different. It\u2019s about serving with the platoon of people that you\u2019ve grown to love \u2013 serving them as much as serving your country. You\u2019re surprised by how strongly you can bond with a group of strangers. That bond is a powerful thing \u2013 difficult to find in the civilian world. At the time you joined, it sounds as though your life wasn\u2019t really going anywhere? No, it wasn\u2019t going anywhere. I was working a bunch of odd jobs and living in the back of my parents\u2019 house, paying rent. When you were forced to leave the marines, you said you were devastated. Do you still feel that way? Well, it\u2019s easier now, but at the time I was pretty disappointed that I couldn\u2019t go overseas with my group of guys. I think I\u2019ll always regret that. Is there crossover with the marines and acting? Of course, big time! The small group of people trying to accomplish a mission greater than themselves. It\u2019s not about one person; it\u2019s a collaborative effort. You have to know your role, and sometimes within that group there\u2019s one person who knows what your mission is. That\u2019s a direct crossover. You can\u2019t act alone in a room \u2013 no one is going to see it. You can\u2019t create something alone. You need people to support you. Was the impetus behind starting your non-profit organisation, Arts in the Armed Forces, that forces personnel are more complex and cultural than people might think? Yes \u2013 it\u2019s to bring thought-provoking theatre-based troop entertainment to an audience that wouldn\u2019t normally be associated with theatre. And we get the reactions that we\u2019re going for. \u201cMost troop entertainment is so bad and this is so good.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never been to a play before.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know theatre was like that.\u201d The responses are overwhelming. I get a tremendous amount from it. How are you with the frothy side of celebrity? I don\u2019t think of myself as a celebrity. There are things about being known for your work that are good and there are things that are bad, so I try to keep perspective. I\u2019m surrounded by people who keep things as real as possible. You had quite a religious upbringing. Are you drawing on that as a priest in Silence? I was raised in a Baptist church in the midwest. Religion was part of my upbringing, so yes. Do you have faith yourself? No, I try not to have the right answer about anything. You got married in 2013. Is it important for you to have stability in your private life? Isn\u2019t that important to everybody? Some artists may prefer to live as wild, unstructured and bohemian a life as possible. They might think that\u2019s how artists need to live - to mix things up? Well, you can still mix things up in married life. What about being a sex symbol? [Laughs loudly] I have nothing to say about that. You must have been told before that you have an amazing unusual face? It\u2019s a compliment - not being the standard Hollywood McHunk has worked in your favour.  I have been told before that I have an unusual face. But my face is my face. I had a whole life before acting, over the years. Lots of things have been said about my face. What about awards and general public reaction \u2013 people coming up to you in the street? As far as awards go, it\u2019s flattering and humbling to be honoured by your peers, but it doesn\u2019t mean anything. Reactions in the street are always good \u2013 people don\u2019t tend to come up to you and tell you you\u2019re an asshole. It\u2019s never a long conversation anyway \u2013 they usually see that I\u2019m more scared of them than they are of me and the whole power dynamic shifts. What is the actor\u2019s job? It\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t know. Sometimes it\u2019s a service; sometimes it feels like a business; sometimes it feels like just storytelling; sometimes it feels more powerful than that. There are said to be east coast and west coast acting sensibilities \u2013 are you equally comfortable with both? I very much live in New York and I\u2019m very much simpatico with a New York sensibility. But I just want to work where the writing is good. The scale or the budget shouldn\u2019t be where you put your energy. The size doesn\u2019t matter to me. You could work on something that\u2019s big budget but it\u2019s not creatively challenging. What are your immediate plans? After this, I\u2019ll be working on Girls again, and whatever happens after that will happen. As far as plans go, I try not to have one. I hope I\u2019ve learned that having a plan turns out to be a waste of energy.

Yet a survey of solo exhibitions in American galleries over the past six years has revealed that 73% were by male artists.  A report in the Art Newspaper found that Andy Warhol, Ellsworth Kelly and Jasper Johns each had seven exhibitions over the period. The female artist with the most exhibitions was Kara Walker, who had four. However, as Kusama\u2019s success indicates, audiences are not biased against women artists. The second-most popular solo show in the six-year period was Marina Abramovic\u2019s retrospective at MoMA in New York. An average of 7,120 visitors a day came to see, among other works, Abramovic sitting motionless in the gallery.  She was only beaten by the sculptor Richard Serra, whose momumental sculptures drew 8,585 visitors a day to MoMA in 2007.  Defying the conventional wisdom that only big names draw crowds, the Swiss (and female) artist Pipilotti Rist had the fourth-most popular solo show in the period. Her installation at MoMA, which hosted 17 of the 20 most popular exhibitions in the six-year period, drew 6,186 visitors per day. The Art Newspaper found that male artists represented by the world\u2019s major art dealers were over seven times more likely to be given a solo exhibition than female artists signed to the same top gallerists, including Gagosian, Hauser &amp; Wirth and David Zwirner.  Against this background, Kusama\u2019s success in 2014 looks even more remarkable.

As the Japanese advanced, Liu directed his workmen to dig a large hole in the garden, deeper than a man was tall and as wide as a bedroom. They lined the pit with bamboo shelving, on which they stacked the family\u2019s heirlooms: antique furniture, jade, scrolls, and Liu\u2019s prized porcelain collection, all carefully packed in straw. The men laboured after dark, filling the vault to its brim before covering it with a false floor and replanting the vegetation on top.     Liu Feng Shu with one of his grandsons in the 1930s.    One night in July, shortly after the burials were completed, a raggedy Chinese soldier knocked on the door and asked for something to eat. After Liu took him in and fed him, the soldier said, \u201cWhy have you not left yet? The city has fallen. The Japanese are here.\u201d The next morning, my great-great-grandfather and his family stuffed as much jewellery and silver as they could fit in their pockets and bundled their clothes in knapsacks. They barricaded the heavy front doors and fled for Sichuan province, where the Chinese army had retreated, leaving behind the buried treasure. Liu had been born to a modest, landowning family as China\u2019s last imperial dynasty \u2013 the Qing \u2013 was crumbling. Though he earned the second-highest score on the district-level imperial civil service examination, he declined a government position, instead returning to his village of Xingang, where he established a private school and invested his earnings in land. In the tradition of Chinese scholar-gentry, Liu patronised the arts and collected porcelain by the crate. He filled his house with vases of every shape and size, decorative plates, figurines of Buddhist gods, tableware, and dowries for his five granddaughters. The collection supposedly included valuable imperial wares. The family lived a wealthy, comfortable existence in post-imperial, Republican China. Though a staunch Confucian, Liu had his sons study at engineering colleges and, at a time when women often didn\u2019t even receive names, sent his granddaughters to a nearby Methodist boarding school where they learned English and received western educations; my grandmother was not the first woman in the family to earn a college degree. The family summered on nearby Mount Lu in Guling, the missionary retreat established by an Englishman, Edward Selby Little, their villa sitting across a small stream from that of the Chinese military and political leader Chiang Kai-shek. Occasionally, the girls would see the generalissimo out on his evening walk. \u201cHello, Mr President,\u201d they said as he passed by. Chiang would wave and warn them to be careful around the water. If my parents told me about Liu and his buried porcelain, it never registered. Growing up in Utah, I paid little attention to family stories, most of which concerned overcoming hardships that I, preoccupied with overcoming my own hardship of being Chinese and non-Mormon in Salt Lake City, couldn\u2019t relate to and didn\u2019t care to hear about. As far as I was concerned, the Chinese people in my life, with their loud, angry-sounding manner of speaking and odd habits, were from another planet and had travelled to Earth for the sole purpose of embarrassing me. By the time I went to China to look for my great-great-grandfather\u2019s porcelain, armed with little more than strands of a family legend, I still had far more questions than answers. How much porcelain and silver was buried? Were there really imperial pieces in the collection? Where was the old family house? Did it still belong to us? Had anyone ever tried to recover the porcelain? What happened to it? But my family\u2019s long march had splintered it over thousands of miles and two continents, an estrangement that hardened when the Communists took the mainland in 1949. My grandmother, the oldest of her generation and a chemist working in a Kuomintang research laboratory, and her cousin, married to a high-ranking Kuomintang officer, fled to Taiwan. My grandmother\u2019s family eventually resettled in the US. The rest of their family \u2013 sisters, cousins, my great-great-grandfather \u2013 stayed behind in China, and for decades neither side knew anything about the other. When I arrived in Shanghai, where my 96-year-old grandmother had moved after many decades in Texas to live with one of my uncles, many of the principal characters were long dead, and those old enough to still remember the porcelain were elderly and unknown to me. I soon learned that when the porcelain was buried, my grandmother had already graduated from Ginling women\u2019s college in Nanjing (just months before the Rape of Nanking) and headed south to teach at a missionary school in Guangzhou, and then Macau. Though Macau remained a safe haven for most of the war, food shortages after Hong Kong fell in 1941 forced my grandmother into her own harrowing trek back to Chongqing, China\u2019s wartime capital. Though her memory remained impressively sharp, she preferred the family history to remain buried. The old fears and grudges \u2013 including against Liu, who had prevented her from pursuing her desired medical studies \u2013 from the wars and dislocations had ossified over time, and she discouraged me from seeking out other relations. Navigating family mores was nothing like navigating China, which unfolded relatively easily once I relearned the Chinese that I had forgotten. But through a mixture of patience, persistence, and felicitous timing, I eventually arranged to visit my grandmother\u2019s cousin in Taiwan, Liu Pei Yu, who had remained close to their grandfather and had helped with the burials. She turned out to be as chatty as my grandmother was reticent. As the widow of a Kuomintang military officer, her loyalties were clear. In her stories, the Kuomintang were the noble heroes, while the Communists are \u201cred bandits\u201d, \u201cghouls\u201d or \u201cbastards\u201d, the Communist sympathisers in the family were \u201ctraitors\u201d, and she gave dates as \u201cthe nth year of the Republic of China\u201d. From her, I learned about Liu\u2019s scholarly achievements, the small empire he built in Xingang, the respect he commanded from the villagers, his heroism in taking his family to safety during the war, and how he died in 1951 after being kicked out of his house and forced to live in a pigsty by the Communists. She even had a box of photographs from her childhood, my first real glimpses of a time that, until then, had been more myth than reality. But she could only speculate about the fate of that buried porcelain, as the Sino-Japanese war was just the start of a series of catastrophes for the country, and when she returned to see her hometown well after the cultural revolution, it was so changed she could barely locate Liu\u2019s house. By then, everything belonged to the government, anyway. Back on the mainland, I rushed to visit the remaining relations while I still could, a winding journey punctuated by dinner meetings with Chinese officials, altercations with reckless drivers, a frantic night searching for a rabies clinic in Jingdezhen, numerous illnesses, and plenty of wild goose chases. These were relations whom I had not even known existed, much less been familiar with their stories. And yet they welcomed me, the first of my generation to seek them out, with an unexpected warmth.     Huan Hsu, who journeyed to China in search of his great-great-grandfather\u2019s buried treasure. Photograph: Martijn van Nieuwenhuyzen    In Beijing, I met my grandmother\u2019s youngest sister, Liu Pei Sheng, whose vivacity made it hard to believe she had suffered a stroke a few years ago. Her memory faded in and out, and I tried my best to coax clues from her. Her husband, on the other hand, a retired academic, could not have been more lucid. An American-educated metallurgist, he had been tapped for China\u2019s nuclear programme in 1956, and for nearly two decades worked on an arid plateau in western Qinghai province running experiments. When the country began devouring itself during the cultural revolution, his position was such that he was singled out for torture, physical and psychological. His children were sent to the countryside for \u201cre-education\u201d and locked out of universities. Somehow, despite all the murders and suicides around him, he survived, and he recounted it all with remarkable equanimity. But they could tell me little about the porcelain, so I went north to Jinan, in China\u2019s agricultural heartland, to find the only male of my grandmother\u2019s generation, who would have inherited my great-great-grandfather\u2019s estate. Liu Cong Ji had also stayed on the mainland after the Communist victory, and, like everyone, had paid the price for his bourgeois background. His father, the only one of my great-great grandfather\u2019s three sons to survive the war, was terrorised so unrelentingly during one of Mao\u2019s campaigns that he killed himself. Liu Cong Ji showed me the only photograph of my great-great-grandfather that my family owned. Once I made my way back to Xingang, still home to the Liu family cemetery, where my great-great-grandfather was buried, I could hardly keep up with all the relations I was introduced to, including the keeper of the jia pu, the recorded genealogy stretching back more than a dozen generations. By then, my journey had become more than a search for clues to lost treasure. It was a race to preserve stories before they, too, were lost, an accretion of the memories and piecing back together of the narratives that were far more fragile than porcelain. And the journalist in me couldn\u2019t help testing and corroborating the information I had heard. A native term for overseas Chinese is huaqiao. Hua means \u201cChinese\u201d and qiao is a homonym for \u201cbridge\u201d. When I first heard the term, I imagined myself stretched across the Pacific Ocean with my head in America and my feet in China (or vice versa, a fitting confusion for an American-born Chinese), getting trampled on by people from both sides. But as I untangled the antecedents to my return to my ancestral home, I was reminded that being a huaqiao had also revealed a new world that I, by an accident of birth, could explore with as much or as little confrontation as I chose. And that I could spend the rest of my life tracing my roots through that world. I began to understand the concept of a huaqiao not as a burden but a privilege. Truth is a shifty thing in families. I had hoped to find consensus, a unified theory that captured and explained the entire history of the Lius. Instead, each relation had his or her own version of events, often cast in light of their personal experiences, biases and insecurities. Liu Pei Yu, my grandmother\u2019s cousin in Taiwan, remembered the porcelain collection having been as vast as it was valuable. Her cousin Liu Cong Ji on the mainland described it as nothing special, of mostly sentimental value. Were her memories gilded by a life spent in exile? And had he changed his in order to survive movement after movement targeting the gentry and intelligentsia? In the end, the truth is whatever you choose to believe. Yet I was surprised at how much turned out just like my family had said. After three years of searching for Liu\u2019s buried porcelain collection, I found myself squeezed into a black Mazda with distant relations, cruising along the Yangtze river to Xingang. The village was indeed a half-day\u2019s walk east of Jiujiang, the port city where my grandmother and her sisters had attended boarding school, which still stood. The fields along the river that had belonged to Liu were as expansive as my relations described. After we made a left at the main intersection, wound around a gentle, inclined turn, and stopped before a tall metal gate, I saw that his estate really had been converted into a cotton factory after it was \u201cliberated\u201d by the Communists. The factory looked as if it had been abandoned for years, the lock on its gate rusted shut. Weeds pushed up between the seams of the concrete courtyard around which long brick buildings were arranged. Grass and bushes grew wild on the vacant, northern end. We found a rickety ladder made of scrap wood leaning against the wall, and moments later I was standing on my great-great-grandfather\u2019s old property. We walked into the overgrowth, my grandmother\u2019s local cousin, whom I called Uncle Tang, holding his arms before him like divining rods. The air buzzed with cicadas. \u201cThe washroom was over there, I think,\u201d he said, motioning for me to follow him to a small clearing. \u201cThere was a big cistern we used for baths.\u201d \u201cAnd over there was the kitchen,\u201d he said, pointing to another area. He put one palm against his head and thought. \u201cThat retaining wall used to run all the way along the property. That means the garden would have been \u2026\u201d He led me to another spot where someone had planted a few rows of wilted vegetables. \u201c\u2026 about here.\u201d Uncle Tang pointed at the ground. \u201cThis is it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is probably where they buried the porcelain.\u201d We looked, but it turned out not to be the place, and so the search continued. But I had closed the circle. Somewhere near where I stood, on this very patch of land, my great-great-grandfather had breathed the same air and dug the same earth. And I realised that no matter what I might find, I\u2019d already discovered heirlooms far more valuable and enduring than Liu\u2019s buried treasure: my family. \u2022 The Porcelain Thief by Huan Hsu is published by Fourth Estate, \u00a316.99.

The Four Books is an Orwellian satire of life in a re-education labour camp for intellectuals during Mao\u2019s Great Leap Forward. In District 99, one area of a sprawling re-education complex, no one has a real name. Yan\u2019s protagonists are simply the Musician, the Scholar, the Author, the Theologian. Their days involve gruelling physical labour. They are exhorted to inform on each other\u2019s deviant behaviour. Their supervisor, the Communist party personified, is called the Child, and enjoys his system of reward and punishment. As the story develops, the novel touches on a forbidden topic in contemporary China \u2013 the Great Famine of the late 50s. Misconduct in food distribution and unbalanced industrial production, fused with natural disaster, produced a staggering death toll \u2013 officially 15 million, but independent historians surmise it was closer to 36 million. The novel gives us a strangely abstract, almost disembodied idea of human suffering; it is depicted as an all-pervading atmosphere, from which neither religion nor human love can offer any escape. Reading The Four Books isn\u2019t an easy undertaking, but it is richly rewarding. The English translation comes across as quite precise and poetic to me, a native Chinese speaker. I was hoping to find an original version in Chinese, being curious about the exact form of Yan\u2019s style, but there is no Chinese publication available, either on the internet or as a physical copy. There is talk of a Taiwanese version, but it\u2019s not distributed outside Taiwan. This is another case of a Chinese novel that can never be published in mainland China \u2013 and Yan has said that while he was writing the book, he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to publish it in his native country, so he wrote it with absolute freedom in his heart. Chinese writers generally work under self-censorship. This is a deep troublesome issue for any writer. From a practical point of view, it\u2019s almost a necessity that writers bear in mind the regulations of censorship in composition. But what if the internal censor cannot do its job? The writer who recognises this can choose exile: Ma Jian in London, Gao Xingjian in Paris, Liao Yiwu in Berlin. But not every artist whose internal censor fails to suppress thought can, or wants to, take this option. And for them the only outcome is jail, with all civil rights removed by the state, as in the case of Liu Xiaobo, the poet and Nobel peace prize laureate. For Yan, the situation is complex. He is a well-respected state writer in China, but for most of his books, discussion in the official media is forbidden. Nor can he participate much in the official life of Chinese writers. Yet he is not interested in living abroad, even though he is the winner of the prestigious Franz Kafka prize and has been a finalist for the Man Booker International prize. He encompasses both internal and external contradictions, perhaps not an unusual Chinese predicament. A great writer is able to transfigure harsh reality, tread a path equally absurd and transcendent. In The Four Books, Yan confronts his characters with brutality, but also immerses them in religion and myth, and not just of the Chinese variety. The book of Genesis and the Virgin Mary obsess some of the characters: the Theologian eventually comes to hate the Virgin, whose icon he tramples, while the Child, who struggles to eradicate religious texts and images, perversely triggers his own spirituality. The novel ends with \u201cA New Myth of Sisyphus\u201d, presented as one of the four books on which the Scholar has been working intensely. Yan offers us a different Sisyphus and claims that a hero is \u201cone who can accept the absurdity, hardship and punishment\u201d. Yan seems to accept the idea of God, even though he is living in a post-Mao, atheistic China. As a reader, you close the book with a profound sense of how ideology has permeated and changed every sector of collective human life, from trivial daily matters to the great ruptures of history. \u2022 Xiaolu Guo\u2019s I Am China is published by Chatto &amp; Windus.

The reason for this is slightly more contested. Perhaps unsurprisingly, lack of financial investment is consistently touted. George Osborne has announced that \u00a340m will be set aside for research and development around the internet of things, which many people say is too little. \u201cThe truth is, that\u2019s nothing. A venture capital company would provide this kind of funding,\u201d says John Bates, head of industry solutions at Software AG. Instead, he offers, \u201cOsborne should provide tax breaks for early adopters to remove the risk aversion.\u201d  Jon Hook, vice-president of platform and product at Phunware, is encouraged by the pledged investment, but questions how far it will go. \u201cWith Gartner, IDC and Cisco predicting figures from \u00a3800bn to \u00a31.5tn in net revenue generated by internet of things services, it\u2019s hard to see what \u00a340m will achieve.\u201d     The public sector needs to pay better salaries so it can get more visionary IT leaders  John Bates, Software AG     While internet of things investment would likely result in cost savings in the long term, Bates claims that \u201clack of vision, entrepreneurial thinking and execution\u201d is a barrier to the public sector\u2019s adoption of such technologies. Tim Wilson, former deputy head of ICT for NHS City and Hackney, and current chief information security officer at Optum International, insists that shrinking budgets combined with IT staff cuts mean that \u201cthe talent has moved to the private sector to use their knowledge and contacts to develop this IoT technology\u201d. The public sector is often faced with red tape and the requirement to provide a strong return-on-investment argument, which is challenging in a fairly unproven area. \u201cThere\u2019s a real lack of successful IoT use cases in both the public and private sectors, so risk averse public sector officials are not likely to invest in new, unproven IoT technologies,\u201d says Charlie Clark, CEO of Rosslyn Analytics. It will therefore be left to the private sector tech giants \u2013 such as Cisco and Samsung, as well as the venture capital backed startups \u2013 to drive innovation and ultimately bid for the public sector technology contracts.  More visionaries Risk aversion is less of a concern in the private sector where companies are dependent on a competitive edge. That, combined with greater financial investment, and an understanding that both costs and risks can be reduced through the internet of things, keeps the private sector at the forefront of IoT innovation. \u201cBusiness people see these opportunities and realise they are game-changers, but local authorities don\u2019t think the same way,\u201d says Bates. \u201cThe public sector needs to pay better salaries so it can get more visionary IT leaders.\u201d  There may be a lack of awareness of what the IoT can bring to public services.   Related: Eight questions you should be asking about the internet of things    According to George Rousso, professor of pervasive computing at Birkbeck, University of London, public opinion and reluctance towards the IoT is currently holding back governments and councils from extending its use. \u201cThe IoT potentially creates an extremely detailed and suggestive data trail about citizens\u2019 movements in the material \u2013 as well as the digital \u2013 world, and this data footprint raises deep concerns about intrusions to the life of individuals,\u201d he says. Insufficient infrastructure  Public opinion and talent aside, experts caution that old IT infrastructures are, crucially, unable to support IoT systems. \u201cThe nation needs to have the correct communications and Wi-Fi infrastructure in place to be able to support millions of sensors within connected devices,\u201d says Mark Morley, director of manufacturing at OpenText. Wilson, too, is concerned that this is a much greater concern in rural areas where \u201ceven basic internet infrastructure is missing\u201d. Internet of things technology can\u2019t simply be bolted on as an after-thought: it needs to be developed from within.  \u201cDespite the analyst forecast, IoT is not seen as an immediate priority weighed up against existing infrastructure projects,\u201d says Phunware\u2019s Hook. Where huge investment has been poured into the devices \u2013 by 2015, research firm Gartner estimates that there will be more things than people on the internet \u2013 very little has been afforded to the infrastructure behind it. Digital pioneers  In the UK, Milton Keynes, Bristol, Glasgow and Manchester have all been leading the way, rolling out smart city initiatives. Overseas, experts list Germany, Singapore, US, Korea and Taiwan as the IoT pioneers.   Related: How the internet of things could revolutionise council services    In the UK, the most significant IoT headway has been made by the healthcare sector and the military.  \u201cThe military have been IoT pioneers under the guise of \u2018network-centric warfare\u2019 and \u2018the digital battles space\u2019,\u201d says Bates. \u201cSemi-autonomous drones are leading the move towards fully-autonomous swarming battle strategies, and wearable computing is being adopted.\u201d In healthcare, the NHS has invested millions of pounds into virtually monitoring patients\u2019 health. The telehealth project, an expansion of telemedicine, enables the home monitoring of patients. \u201cFigures provided by the NHS showed that using telehealth reduces mortality by 45%, A&amp;E attendances by 15% and emergency admissions by 20%,\u201d said Alistair Smit, CEO of Blueberry Home Solutions, a company developing IoT solutions for remote hot water and boiler technology for the NHS and other public sector areas.   Another NHS project has switched three million long-term NHS patients scheduled for regular hospital check-ups to remote monitoring.  Out of the lab into the real world  Paul Sant, associate dean at the University Campus Milton Keynes, University of Bedfordshire, is heading up the MK Smart project \u2013 a big data hub gathering information on smart parking, smart bin collections, and smart watering for gardens. Sant explains how Milton Keynes council is working with the Satellite Applications Catapult to see how high-resolution satellite imagery can be combined with planning application data to help planning officers oversee developments.  \u201cThere are clear public service benefits [from the IoT] that can make a real change to citizen\u2019s lives,\u201d says Sant. The public sector just needs to take IoT projects out of the research labs and find the funding to deploy the technology in the real world.

Loathed by the older generation, and largely unknown by the younger, milky tapioca pudding\u2019s bad rep, and the dish itself, has all but faded into obscurity. \u201cLots of people associate tapioca with boarding school or school dinners,\u201d says Brett Graham, head chef at The Ledbury, \u201cbut that tends to be the older generation, so things are changing\u201d. Graham, who grew up in Australia, is just one of a growing cohort of celebrated chefs elevating tapioca beyond bowls of milky gloop. It turns up in sweet and savoury forms at his two-Michelin-starred restaurant in Notting Hill. He\u2019s far from alone - chefs around the world love it. At The French Laundry in California, Thomas Keller serves it with oysters, the small pearls suspended in an oyster-infused sabayon; Michel Roux Jr cooks tapioca in squid ink and teams it with calamari and garlic butter at Le Gavroche. In his S\u00e3o Paulo restaurant, DOM, Brazilian chef Alex Atala serves tapioca pearls in a sharp manioc-root extract tucupi with giant river fish pirarucu. Heston Blumenthal used tapioca flour, masquerading as sand, in his seafood ensemble Sound of the Sea. But it\u2019s not just the preserve of michelin-starred chefs. Tapioca starch, extracted from manioc (cassava), is sold in a number of guises, from flour to flakes, pearls of varying sizes, and precooked \u201cinstant\u201d tapioca. It\u2019s cheap, too \u2013 around \u00a31 for a 500g bag of pearl \u2013 and it\u2019s a staple in many cuisines. In Brazil, it\u2019s an everyday ingredient, savoured in bite-sized cheese breads (p\u00e3o de queijo), as puffed biscoito globo crisps, boiled up with red wine, sugar, clove and cinnamon as sagu de tapioca, or melted into crepes (beiju) that are stuffed with everything from sun-dried beef, to coconut and condensed milk. As Atala points out, tapioca is used a lot in Asia, \u201cand so Europeans know it as an Asian ingredient,\u201d having made its way east from Brazil with the Portuguese in the Age of Discovery. In India, sabudana (tapioca pearls) are boiled up with sweetened milk in a pudding that was perhaps the precursor to our milk pudding. Or mixed with potatoes, peanuts and spices in sabudana vada (fried dumplings) or sabudana ni khichdi \u2013 a popular saut\u00e9ed dish on fast days in Gujarat and other Northern Indian states. Tapioca flour is also used to make crispy papad and coconut rolls (puttu) in Malayali cuisine. \u201cIn Thailand, tapioca is used for thickening sauces, and to make a few desserts,\u2019\u201d says Thai chef Yui Sriyabhaya, who describes a handful of desserts all made with coconut milk, palm-sugar syrup and tapioca in varying forms, such as the fat worms of boiled tapioca dough in krong kraeng, or the green (dyed with pandan leaves) tapioca jelly matchsticks in lod chong Singapore. Marina Pipatpan, Thai chef-owner of S\u00e3o Paulo restaurant Tian, remembers growing up in Thailand with similar desserts that mix saku (tapoioca pearls), syrup and coconut milk with black beans (saku tua dtam) or crunchy corn kernels (saku kao pod). \u201cMy favourite is an ancient dish that\u2019s still popular to this day \u2013 saku sai moo. We cook ground pork with sugar and add peanuts and make a ball that we then wrap in tapioca pearls and steam,\u201d she enthuses. Similar dumplings and desserts can be found in other Southeast Asian cuisines, including Korea, Indonesia and China. Not to mention Taiwan, the country that started the craze for bubble tea in the 1980s, with western youth en masse slurping up shiny tapioca pearls through fat straws, and franchises making or breaking based on their ability to cook the pearls to perfection, between bouncy and chewy. Tapioca is the perfect blank canvas; its capacity to hold colour, to absorb and release a burst of flavour (my favourite is tapioca pearls cooked in soy), and its versatile texture are exactly why chefs love it. So how to get it right at home? \u201cCook it till you have just the tiniest pinprick of white left in the centre,\u201d says chef Alyn Williams. \u201cTapioca pearls should be soft and silky.\u201d For Brett Graham, the secret is in soaking the pearls in milk or stock first (the former for sweet and the latter for savoury), then rinsing them and cooking them in plenty of milk or stock, and rinsing again afterwards to remove any excess starch. Do you dare have a go?

Using data from 24 separate trials involving almost 6,000 children around the world, researchers found that pupils who are taught at school about preventing sexual abuse through games, books and songs are more likely than others to report their own experiences of abuse. The findings, which were published on Thursday, show that among children who did not receive any teaching about sexual abuse, four in 1,000 disclosed some form of sex abuse. Among those who were taught about it at school, the figure went up to 14 per 1,000. Children who receive teaching on the subject also seem better equipped to deal with potentially dangerous situations, with those who participated in the education programmes more likely than other children to try to protect themselves in a simulated abuse scenario in which they were asked to leave school with a stranger. Whether such school-based programmes actually reduce the incidence of abuse is still unclear, however, and the review\u2019s authors have called for more research to build on their findings. The report concludes: \u201cEven if successful in only a small proportion of situations, given the prevalence of child sexual abuse, it is possible that the skills and knowledge learned in prevention programmes may be of assistance to a considerable number of children.\u201d The quality and availability of sex education in England\u2019s schools has been under scrutiny in recent months, with a report by MPs on Westminster\u2019s education committee calling for it to be mandatory to help safeguard young people from abuse. As this study shows, however, in certain countries primary-age children are already taught how to recognise, react to and report abuse situations through school-based programmes designed to prevent sexual abuse. The findings are the result of a Cochrane review of data from trials of prevention programmes in the US, Canada, China, Germany, Spain, Taiwan and Turkey. Cochrane is a highly regarded, not-for-profit global network of researchers and professionals that carries out systematic reviews of the best available health research. Schools used a variety of methods to educate children about sexual abuse, including films, plays, songs, puppets, books and games. The children, who were almost all of primary-school age, were taught about safety rules, body ownership and who to tell. The report\u2019s authors said there was little evidence that children who took part were worried or in any way adversely affected. In one American school, children took part in a one-hour Stop programme (stop, tell someone, own your body, protect yourself) taught through role-play; in Germany, children watched a live performance called (No) Child\u2019s Play, and in Turkey there were four hour-long sessions based on a programme called Good Touch, Bad Touch. Globally it is estimated that at least one in 10 girls and one in 20 boys experience some form of sexual abuse in childhood. Those who have been abused are more susceptible to depression, eating disorders, suicidal behaviour and drug and alcohol problems in later life. \u201cThis review supports the need to inform and protect children against sexual abuse,\u201d said the Cochrane report\u2019s lead author, Kerryann Walsh, of Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. \u201cBut ongoing research is needed to evaluate school-based prevention programmes, and to investigate the links between participation and the actual prevention of child sexual abuse. To really know whether these programmes are working, we need to see larger studies with follow-up all the way to adulthood.\u201d The study also indicated that the programmes were effective in increasing kids\u2019 lasting knowledge of sexual abuse, with children remembering much of what they had been taught six months later. But the authors also said it was difficult to prove the children had learned the skills that would necessarily translate to a real-life future scenario involving abuse. Walsh said: \u201cEven if a child demonstrates that they know how to behave in a certain scenario, it doesn\u2019t mean they will behave the same in a real situation where there is potential for abuse. Tests cannot mimic real abuse situations very well. For example, we know that most sexual abuse is perpetrated by someone known to the child, whereas in the test situations, unfamiliar actors or research assistants were used.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/16/london-book-fair-erica-jong-new-novel-fear-of-flying-fear-of-dying", "publicationDate": "2015-04-16T13:22:41Z", "tags": ["London book fair", "Books", "Publishing", "Fiction", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Just acquired by Canongate in the UK, and St Martin\u2019s Press in the US, with international publishers snapping up rights from Taiwan to Denmark, Fear of Dying is one of the hottest properties at the international publishing event."], "title": "London book fair excited by Erica Jong's new novel", "article": "More than 40 years after Erica Jong coined the term \u201czipless fuck\u201d in Fear of Flying, her feminist novel of a young woman\u2019s quest for sex with no strings attached, its heroine Isadora Wing is set to return in Fear of Dying.

Brompton folding bikes on display at the London Bike Show. Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images    The demise of bicycle manufacturing in Britain is all the more sad at a time when cycling\u2019s popularity is soaring, with almost \u00a31bn worth of bikes sold in Britain last year. According to CTC, the national cycling charity, even in 2010 around 23,000 people were employed directly in bicycle sales and distribution, which generated \u00a3500m in wages and \u00a3100m in taxes.  The charity also says that staff who regularly cycle to work take on average one less sick day each year than non-cyclists, saving the UK economy almost \u00a383m. Will Butler-Adams, chief executive of Brompton, says: \u201cWe are a solution to a global problem. People forgot about the bike in the 1950s and that was a mistake. We are spending \u00a315bn to build Crossrail, but we have the solution here with this little bike.\u201d Apart from the problems of traffic congestion in large cities such as London, Adams believes the bigger picture is the burden placed on stretched NHS departments by the growing number of people leading much more sedentary lives. \u201cWe are in the urban transport industry; the competition for Brompton is the tube or the car. That\u2019s who our customers are \u2013 urbanites,\u201d he says. \u201cWe cannot go on living in cities the way we are. Governments cannot afford it, they have got to get people more active in cities.\u201d Indeed, city dwellers have become accustomed to the sight of Brompton owners in their office clothes whizzing down cycle lanes on the distinctive small-wheeled bikes, or hopping on a busy commuter train carrying a neatly folded package of wheels and tubes.  Brompton has fared well from the growing number of devotees. . Since Adams, 40, joined the business in 2002 turnover has exploded from \u00a31.7m to \u00a328m last year, with profits of \u00a33.4m. It is on course to hit \u00a330m of sales this year. The success of Brompton is down to a curious combination of Adams\u2019 youthful drive and ambition added to the timeless design of the \u201cfolder\u201d, first created by Andrew Ritchie, founder of the west London bike maker. Ritchie began designing the bike in 1975 from his flat in South Kensington, London, which overlooked Brompton Oratory, the imposing Roman Catholic church from which he took the name. He established Brompton Bicycle a year later and produced the first prototype.  Over the years, Ritchie carved out a niche market of enthusiasts for the folding bike, which was produced under a railway arch in Brentford before moving to its current factory tucked under a flyover near Kew Bridge. By 2008, Ritchie realised he needed somebody to help nurture his baby. Adams, a former Du Pont engineer, had been helping to run the business for six years by then and was keen to push things forward. \u201cI had to do things he\u2019d find difficult,\u201d Adams says. \u201cI wanted to grow faster and become more aggressive with how we communicated. Andrew designed a bike for himself and so he doesn\u2019t see the need to do a lot of these things.\u201d Ritchie stepped back in 2008 and allowed Adams to go for it. There is a strong sense that this was, and still remains, a tough decision for the founder, who continues to work two or three days a week.     A workman brazes components of a folding bike in the Brompton Bicycle factory. Photograph: Piero Cruciatti/REX    There is little doubt though Adams has succeeded. Brompton had just 24 staff producing 7,000 bikes a year when he joined; it now has 230 people and is on course to make 50,000 this year. It sells to 44 countries around the world and 80% of its folders are exported. Although there is huge respect between Brompton\u2019s two protagonists, there also appears to be some tension. Adams describes the relationship with Ritchie as \u201clike a marriage\u201d. \u201cWhat he achieved with the bike is beyond comprehension,\u201d he says.  He describes the founder as a \u201clegend\u201d \u2013 but also as \u201ca constructive pain in the arse\u201d who never lets Adams, or the business, get too big for its boots. As well as retaining an emotional attachment to Brompton, Ritchie remains its biggest shareholder, holding around 20%; Adams has 10%; the staff share 15% and the remainder is split between friends of the founder and chief executive. \u201c[Andrew Ritchie] gave up his baby in 2008 and he\u2019s allowed us to do things he finds uncomfortable. Sometimes he gets upset about it,\u201d Adams says.  \u201cHe\u2019s cantankerous and eccentric but you don\u2019t get to make a difference if you are a shrinking violet. Andrew deserves a lot of credit for the way he\u2019s let go. It\u2019s by no means perfect, but I have huge respect for Andrew. And, on good days, I\u2019m sure he has respect for me.\u201d It is the founder\u2019s laser focus on the detail of the design, he says, that has always set Brompton apart. That design has remained fundamentally the same over the years, tweaked only to make it lighter.  There are likely to be plenty more decisions made by Adams in the next few years that will make the founder flinch. Plans are advanced to move into a bigger factory, still in London, within the year and Adams wants to open a New York sales office to help take a bigger bite out of the Big Apple. Such moves are risky, but the rewards could be huge. A factory tour highlights the urgent need for more space. oTwo cramped lines of Brompton workers are busily assembling the folding bike; adding handlebars and seat, bolting on wheels and pressing stickers onto the frame. A giant scoreboard at the end of the line tells them how they are performing against the target 18 bikes per hour; they are making 19. Adams says the expansion is a gamble. \u201cThe next two or three years we are going to take a bit of a pounding on profits because of the planned investments we are making.\u201d     The Brompton M3R. Photograph: PR handout    At this point, I wonder whether Adams is fattening up the calf ahead of a sale? He dismisses the suggestion, noting that he and Ritchie agree that keeping the business under their control is key. \u201cWe could sell this business today,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sellable business, but for what? Andrew and I have endless differences of opinion but one thing we share vehemently is a passion for retaining control.\u201d He reels off a list of successful privately owned British businesses - Jaguar Land Rover, JCB, Triumph. These are great examples, but they are surely exceptions rather than the norm. Why do so few privately owned businesses in Britain become world beaters in their field?  \u201cI think the temptation to [sell] is huge,\u201d he says. The dealmaking financial culture seems to be against it, he reckons. \u201cWe have the biggest City and I think that gets under the skin of the founders.\u201d  But as a privately owned business Adams says Brompton enjoys more freedom to plan and invest for the long-term.  \u201cIt means we can have fun and we are not too worried about the quarterly results. If you know what is right for the business, bugger the payback time,\u201d he says.      Cyclists prepare their penny-farthings for the Great Knutsford Penny Farthing Race. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images    From penny-farthing to goldmine The bicycle originated in Germany, where in 1817 the Baron Karl von Drais invented his Laufmaschine \u2013 German for running machine, a pedal-less contraption similar to a modern child\u2019s balance bike. The concept was swooped upon by a number of British cart makers, including Denis Johnson of London. In 1818, Johnson patented his \u201cVelocipede\u201d, which the public dubbed the \u201chobby horse\u201d. It is thought Kirkpatrick MacMillan, a Glasgow blacksmith, built the first mechanically propelled bike in 1839. His nephew later claimed his uncle had developed a rear wheel-drive design using mid-mounted pedals, which were connected by rods to a rear crank. By the 1860s, French designs were using larger front wheels and steel frames, which although lighter were more rigid, leading to its nickname of \u201cboneshaker\u201d. The high-wheel bicycle, called the penny-farthing in Britain, had wire spoke tension wheels and proved hugely popular with the Victorians. A burgeoning bicycle manufacturing industry began to grow in Coventry, Oxford, Birmingham and Manchester, manufacturing centres that already had the skills in engineering and metalworking needed for bike production. By the end of the 19th century, Britain had established a clear lead in the development of bicycle manufacturing. In 1888, John Dunlop reinvented the pneumatic bicycle tyre, producing a smoother ride, and in 1890 Sir Frank Bowden formed the Raleigh Bicycle Company in Nottingham."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/australia-culture-blog/2015/apr/18/artist-peter-nelson-new-faces", "publicationDate": "2015-04-18T00:52:55Z", "tags": ["Art", "Culture", "Sculpture", "Video art", "Art and design", "Game culture"], "sentences": ["Peter Nelson, Extensions of a No-Place (Panel 28), 2012    Tell me about the residency you did in Taiwan.It was at Treasure Hill artist village in Taipei, which is half a cultural site and half a village.", "I also included works from MAP Office, an art/architecture duo who live in Hong Kong, and two ink and brush painters, Leung Kui Ting from Hong Kong, and Hsu Yu Jen from Taiwan."], "title": "Artist Peter Nelson: I don\u2019t have the detachment a curator should have", "article": "What\u2019s your art about?It\u2019s about landscape, the way people represent the world around them, and how they end up representing themselves in the process. I\u2019m trained in painting and drawing, but I work between sculpture, video, 3D animation and self-publishing. I make books as well. But the ways that I do all of those things comes from a grounding in drawing. What are your main influences?It changes a lot over time. For years I looked at landscape painting obsessively, then for a while I was into utopian architects, then Chinese painting, which is why I work in Asia so much. Now I\u2019m learning how to make computer games and creating works that have that aesthetic and that hopefully will be experienced like a game. But I think of all of these things as landscapes \u2013 that\u2019s a common thread.     Peter Nelson, Extensions of a No-Place (Panel 28), 2012    Tell me about the residency you did in Taiwan.It was at Treasure Hill artist village in Taipei, which is half a cultural site and half a village. There were a lot of these in Taipei 20 years ago. Most of them were knocked down in the 80s, but this one still exists. I was there for six months.  I find, as an artist, the longer I\u2019m somewhere the better \u2013 in a short amount of time, you have no relationship to the people or art communities. This was the longest residency I\u2019ve done and by far the best, because over time I got a feel for what people there are doing. The exhibitions I had there were something we all enjoyed together; it was different to bringing a show over. And you recently had an exhibition in Hong Kong?Yes. With Grids &amp; Stones, I wanted to say my piece about my relationship to Chinese painting as a contemporary artist. It was at Johnson Chang\u2019s HanArt TZ gallery and I was given free range to curate any artist I wanted into the show. So I had a five-screen animation, a series of drawings, some 3D printed sculptures, and three self-published artist books. I also included works from MAP Office, an art/architecture duo who live in Hong Kong, and two ink and brush painters, Leung Kui Ting from Hong Kong, and Hsu Yu Jen from Taiwan. Is it difficult to be a curator and an artist at the same time?I don\u2019t think I am a curator, really. I was saying: this is stuff I understand in my work and I understand it in their work too, so it made sense to have those artists in that show. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have the detachment a curator would have.            You were involved in the Biennale of Sydney boycott. What do you think the ramifications were?The obvious ramification was that the entire discussion focused on the art world, yet again. I wonder if the best people to ask would be outside that world to see if it had any broader effects in awareness. Obviously it didn\u2019t change anything in terms of government policy \u2013 mandatory detention still exists. I think we\u2019ll have a better way of seeing how all this stuff all plays out in 10 years time. What are you working on next?I have a solo show at MOP Projects called Landscape Tractate opening at the end of April. It\u2019s a collaboration with sound artist Peter Farrar. He\u2019s highly regarded in the experimental music scene and also makes beats for a lot of hip-hop acts. I contacted him because I wanted to do a cultural remix from an art-landscape point of view, and with time-based media I need a rhythm to work to. Which other contemporary artists do you like at the moment?Paul Noble, Harun Farocki, MAP Office. Also Cory Arcangel. I like the breadth of everything that he does. He\u2019ll rejig gaming consoles, makes beautiful drawings, but then he makes remixes of Seinfeld and he has a clothing label, which is hilarious. What exhibitions are you most looking forward to this year?Richard Goodwin\u2019s Bangaroo performance. Richard has a long memory and understanding of what the city of Sydney is about and he\u2019s got a poetic way of combining architecture and performance.            What would you be if you weren\u2019t an artist?After I finished my masters, I thought I should\u2019ve done science. My mum, who is a scientist, laughed at me. She said: \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the same as art. You\u2019re just going to be grinding your teeth for grant money your whole life and 10 years down the track, we\u2019ll have the same conversation!\u201d I had the same thing with architecture. But from that conversation, those two fantasies disappeared because I realised how similar they were to art, and it made me happier about what I am doing. \u2022 Landscape Tractate is at MOP Projects, Sydney from 29 April to 24 May"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/23/china-funeral-strippers-crackdown", "publicationDate": "2015-04-23T19:06:09Z", "tags": ["China", "Death and dying", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["Stripping at funeral is widespread in Taiwan and is a regular feature on YouTube."], "title": "Party's over: China authorities crack down on funeral stripping", "article": " China is cracking down on funeral strippers after controversy over \u201cobscene\u201d performances in the east of the country. In China, the bereaved often put on elaborate entertainment to send the departed off in style and draw more mourners to the ceremony \u2013 but recent funeral shows in Jiangsu and Handan have led the ministry of culture to announce it will work with the police to eliminate such performances. Pictures of a dancer removing her bra in front of parents and children in Handan last month were circulated online, the Wall Street Journal reported.

And a big funeral crowd is also a class marker, much like a big wedding might be. Stripping at funeral is widespread in Taiwan and is a regular feature on YouTube.  Everett Zhang, assistant professor of east Asian studies at Princeton University, has studied Chinese funeral rites and said the practice of hiring performers for lavish shows was expected when the deceased had lived a long life.  \u201cIn China, when the person who dies is very old and has lived a long life, this kind of occasion becomes purely a celebration,\u201d he said.  It\u2019s also a time when the community shows its gratitude to the dead by giving gifts to the family, so there\u2019s pressure to show attendees a good time. \u201cEveryone who comes to the funeral will present a sum of money to the host \u2013 a funeral is a time to collect money and hopefully cover the cost of the service,\u201d Zhang said.

Photograph: Andy Willsher/Redferns    On the one hand, the story of Super Furry Animals is not so very different from the story of any other great rock\u2019n\u2019roll band; they are a group celebrated not only for their exceptional songwriting, their eclectic pop-rock and spectacular live shows, but also for their sheer creativity and imagination. And yet what they represent beyond this is more complex, more heartfelt \u2013 a story of Welsh identity, language and belonging. This week sees the reissue of the band\u2019s fourth album, Mwng, 15 years after it was first released. Mwng was a defining moment in the band\u2019s career \u2013 recorded on the heels of 1999\u2019s bold and inventive top 10 album Guerrilla, it was a quieter offering. Lo-fi and quickly set down, it was also their first album to be written entirely in the Welsh language, and reached No 11 in the UK charts \u2013 the first Welsh language record ever to make the top 20. In the House of Commons Elfyn Llwyd, MP for Meirionnydd Nany Conwy, described Mwng as a celebration of \u201ca new wave of confidence in the Welsh nation\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get it together to rerelease it since its 10th anniversary,\u201d says Rhys. \u201cAnd then we didn\u2019t get around to it \u2013 we forgot.\u201d We have relocated once again, this time to a tapas restaurant on the waterfront, where we are the only customers and a Gipsy Kings album spills across the empty tables. Rhys mimes playing a small, Spanish guitar as he speaks. \u201cWe released Mwng ourselves the first time, and it\u2019s been out of print \u2013 it\u2019s never been released digitally,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd it was also our 20th anniversary as a band and people were offering us lots of gigs. This seemed a good time to celebrate.\u201d   Related: American Interior review \u2013 a Super Furry Animal heads for the frontier    Mwng means \u201cmane\u201d in Welsh, and the album turned much of its gaze inwards on the Welsh nation: its lyrics concerned hard times, the decimation of rural communities, sleaze, land, Roman roads and the ostracism the band had felt from the Welsh music community when they made the decision to sing in English. \u201cMwng is the most minimal thing we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d says Rhys, \u201cand the most difficult to pinpoint when it was made \u2013 our other records are maybe more influenced by the technology of the day. But we wanted to make a very stark record, after Guerrilla, and after spending months and months making big pop records, or records that were quite ambitious, we reacted to that, to make a very simple record. Bringing it down to earth.\u201d They took their cue from a cover of a track, Y Teimlad, by experimental Welsh punk band Datblygu. \u201cAh, it\u2019s an amazing song,\u201d Rhys says. \u201cThe lyrics are incredibly profound, incredibly simple. The band were very experimental, but beneath those textures there\u2019s some incredible songs and we wanted to pull that song out and pay homage in a way to the songs we grew up listening to.\u201d    We were stood by the side of the road in America, in a forest, miles from anywhere    \u201cDatblygu were one of the first bands that actually had a pop at Welsh culture,\u201d says Pryce. \u201cIn a very sharp sense of humour type of way.\u201d Rhys nods. \u201cJust having digs at the Welsh establishment,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere was a Welsh language scene in the 1980s who were anarchist in background rather than nationalist, using the Welsh language because it was their first language, and being radical in their first language. It wasn\u2019t about flag-waving, it was about sentimentality, experimenting and using the Welsh language as a modernist language. Musically, we reacted against it, because they were punk rockers, experimentalists, so we responded by classic rock, because punk had become dull by that point. But they resonated, politically, for us as a band. They\u2019d have a pop at BT or something, or Thatcher, but it definitely caught the mood \u2013 not just in Wales but for all the people who were having a really hard time.\u201d The era in which Mwng\u2019s is being rereleased is not much easier \u2013 that the band have chosen International Workers\u2019 Day as its release date is no coincidence; the band have a long history of activism (Ciar\u00e1n, for instance, once played in a wind turbine in protest against the government\u2019s plans for nuclear expansion, and earlier this year recorded a protest album with ex-Beta Band frontman Steve Mason). It also falls a week before the general election \u2013 could this be seen as an effort to galvanise the voting public? \u201cIt\u2019s an horrific election in many ways,\u201d says Rhys. \u201cThere\u2019s a severe threat to the social fabric; any more years for the Conservative party and it\u2019s going to be disastrous. The quality of life is going to go downhill very fast if they get in again. The cuts are getting serious now \u2013 and the cuts imposed on Wales are horrific. They\u2019re closing birth units. People are going to start dying.\u201d (In a recent NME interview he described this election as \u201ca battle for civilisation\u201d.)         Super Furry Animals performing Demons at Glastonbury in 1999.    Rhys, whose father campaigned for Welsh independence, finds his own perspective on the issue more complicated, muddied by his firm allegiance to the concept of the European Union. \u201cIt would be horrible,\u201d he says, \u201cif everyone sleep-walked out of the EU.\u201d Buford states his intention to vote (\u201cwe\u2019ll be on tour, so postal or by proxy\u201d) but sees that many might be perplexed by the political options before them. \u201cThere\u2019s so many disenfranchised people now,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the young, it\u2019s everyone. So I don\u2019t know, people might even not vote. Not because they\u2019re not arsed, but just because they don\u2019t know who to vote for.\u201d Returning to Mwng, and the language question, Rhys says that writing in English and singing in Welsh don\u2019t feel much different. \u201cThey\u2019re both fantastic languages; it\u2019s just a load of sound coming out of your head.\u201d But the songs for Mwng felt different. \u201cThey feel slightly less throwaway; the songs for Mwng were a bit more emotional.\u201d Welsh poet and writer Menna Elfyn says: \u201cThere is a lyric intensity to the songs on Mwng \u2013 you could almost look at them in a post-colonial way. There\u2019s so much about being on the periphery and banishment and leaving heritage, connecting with those who have been displaced.\u201d Elfyn is a fan of Rhys\u2019s writing. \u201cHis great gift is wordplay,\u201d she says. \u201cThe mischievous element to his writing, the surreal element. Just under the surface, the subliminal message may be a very strident one, but it\u2019s always delivered in such a tender and palatable way, with so many clever echoes of things that are so intrinsically Welsh \u2013 from chapel hymns to singing competitions. The language is a crucial element, but the mood allows it to reach out and be accessible to non-Welsh speakers too.\u201d Fifteen years ago, the band made the somewhat unexpected decision not to perform Mwng in Wales. \u201cIt would have been too emotional,\u201d says Rhys. \u201cFor us, but also because people could have turned out like at rugby matches, with people dressed up as red dragons and leeks. So we decided only to tour it in America and Japan.\u201d In America, the band had at first been swept under the umbrella of Britpop. \u201cBut then when Mwng came out it was like, \u2018Oh right, they\u2019re not Oasis then\u2019,\u201d recalls Bunford. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really understand it from the start,\u201d says Pryce. Their abiding memory of that tour occurred several miles out of Woodstock, when the husband-and-wife team driving their bus decided to throw the band out and leave them by the side of the road. \u201cIt was quite an extreme tour, and they thought we\u2019d been disrespecting the bus,\u201d Rhys explains. \u201cAnd we simply hated them,\u201d adds Bunford. \u201cThey were horrible. Racists.\u201d \u201cAnd then they drove off with some of our stuff still in the van,\u201d Rhys continues. \u201cWe were just stood by the side of the road, in the forest, miles from anywhere in the middle of the USA.\u201d They did not see their belongings again, he recalls dimly. \u201cI lost a record deck. Bunf got off with one shoe. What did you do for shoes?\u201d Bunford thinks for a moment. \u201cI had one shoe. I think most of my clothes went away. I remember the last 10 minutes just before we got kicked off. I was in a haze, an amazing haze, and actually just coming out with just one shoe it just felt really normal. And I think I was the only one who was smiling.\u201d Pryce and Rhys laugh. \u201cAnd that,\u201d Rhys says solemnly, \u201cwas the end of the Mwng tour.\u201d Since they went on hiatus six years ago, the band have been busy with various other projects, including Ieuan\u2019s band the Peth, with Pryce, actor (and former Super Furries singer) Rhys Ifans, and numerous others; and Gulp, Pryce\u2019s band with his partner, the Scottish keyboardist Lindsey Leven. Rhys, meanwhile, has pursued a number of other projects, among them Neon Neon, a collaboration with the producer Boom Bip dating from 2006, and, most recently, a concept album and film, American Interior, about the life of Welsh explorer John Evans. To be back together again \u201cfeels quite normal, because we spend so much time together\u201d, Rhys says (the band\u2019s line-up has remained unchanged since they formed in 1993). \u201cWe\u2019re like an asteroid belt \u2013 it\u2019s like a cosmos of bands. We go out in orbit and then there are moments when we\u2019re squashed back together.\u201d The reunion shows this year will not only draw upon Mwng but the band\u2019s entire nine-album back catalogue. As might be expected from a band who have dressed as yetis and once faked their own deaths with (malfunctioning) blood packs on stage at Hammersmith Apollo, they have some fairly ambitious plans for these performances. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try and visually feed back as people,\u201d says Rhys, neatly. Pryce looks at him quizzically. \u201cAre we?\u201d he asks. Rhys nods. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d he says. \u201cWe contacted the most extreme lighting person we\u2019ve ever met, and he\u2019s worked out a system where through multiple projections we can appear like we\u2019re feeding back ourselves.\u201d \u201cI had no idea about this,\u201d says Bunford. \u201cThis is the first I\u2019ve heard about it. All I knew was that we were wearing some painter and decorator overalls. Is that part of it? Is that why?\u201d Pryce smiles. \u201cIs this is a game-changer?\u201d he asks and Bunford shakes his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just trying to get my head round it. How would you do it?\u201d Rhys will not be drawn on technical details. \u201cThat\u2019s the thrill of trying out ideas. We consider ourselves a public service of trying things out, and some things work and some things don\u2019t.\u201d Several things, he concedes, have not worked. \u201cThe tracksuits we once used that were covered with little bulbs weren\u2019t particularly bright, but we tried them, we gave it 100%. We thought we were going to be like Blackpool.\u201d Pryce looks a little sad. \u201cI thought we were gonna look like Tron,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought we were going to look like the future, but we looked like Teletubbies. And they were the second lot, because we got one set made and they were too small.\u201d After a warm-up gig just over the border in Gloucestershire, the reunion shows will begin in Cardiff with a three-night sold-out run. \u201cWe feel we\u2019re ready to reveal the Mwng songs!\u201d says Rhys. \u201cIt will be very emotional.\u201d Pryce agrees: \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be an enjoyment,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of water that\u2019s gone under the bridge since Mwng was released. Time, time, time\u2026 everything becomes a bit more nostalgic with time. And lots of Welsh bands have come and gone since then \u2013 it\u2019s become normal for bands to come from Wales.\u201d He stops, contemplates the empty restaurant and the Gipsy Kings. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says after a moment or two. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be moments where possibly a guy jumps on stage dressed as a leek.\u201d The Super Furries play Gloucester Guildhall on Tuesday, Cardiff University Students\u2019 Union (1, 2, 3 May) and further dates throughout May.

This year\u2019s tables show a mixed picture in the UK, and suggest that academic excellence is continuing to spread eastwards. But which countries are gaining ground and who is losing out?  The subject tables are dominated by US universities \u2013 again US institutions continue to outperformed their rivals, accounting for more than a third of top 50 places. This isn\u2019t a huge surprise \u2013 US universities also did best in the overall institution-level performance table that was released in September last year. The top US performers are Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u2013 one or other is ranked first across 21 subject areas. In terms of subject areas, the US did especially well in communication and media studies \u2013 where it accounted for 30 of the top 50 institutions. It also dominated the top 50 list for statistics and operational research (24 institutions), as well as the tables for environmental sciences, earth and marine sciences and biological sciences (23 institutions each). The UK comes second, but some institutions lose out UK universities rank second to US institutions, accounting for 14% of the top 50 spots available. But it\u2019s a mixed picture \u2013 of its subject entries listed, 30% have lost ground, while 18% have improved. Researchers say this is partly because newer, emerging institutions are challenging the dominant countries. The types of UK institution that are making it to the top of the rankings has also broadened. UK universities ranked best in seven subject areas, including education, development studies, art and design, English language and literature, and business and management studies. This marks a slight improvement on 2014, where it led in five subjects \u2013 though both development studies and art and design are new categories.  This year the University of Sussex, London Business School and the Royal College of Art joined the list of UK universities to be awarded first place.       Other top performers include the University of Oxford \u2013 the only UK institution to lead in two subject areas, geography and modern languages \u2013 and the University of Cambridge, which has the highest number of disciplines ranked in the top 10. Cambridge appeared in the top 10 for 31 subject areas, whereas Oxford and Standford did so in only 29 subjects.  John O\u2019Leary, member of the QS Global Academic Advisory Board, says UK universities do well in virtually all the subjects, but adds: \u201cSpecialist providers like the Royal College of Art and University College London\u2019s Institute of Education are also shown to be world-leaders.\u201d Overall, UK universities excelled in the arts and humanities, with 17 institutions featuring in the top 30. Of these, nine were part of the Russell Group.  Chris Husbands, director of the UCL Institute of Education, which was ranked top of the education category, says the rankings show that UK higher education is punching above its weight. But he warns that the sector is changing quickly and becoming very competitive.  \u201cAcross the piece, Asian universities are rising. That\u2019s not a surprise \u2013 levels of funding for higher education are high, and universities are a key element in the knowledge economies. The well-endowed private American universities also do well.  \u201cBut the world of higher education is shifting fast, and I suspect that in 15 years the picture will look different.\u201d  Is academic excellence moving eastwards? Asian universities are continuing to emerge as competitors to the US and UK, according to Ben Sowter, head of research at QS. He says that institutions in the region are much more strongly represented than last year, with 70 additional places across the subjects occupied by universities from China and Hong Kong.  \u201cChina in particular has been investing heavily in research productivity over the past 10 years, and quality is beginning to follow. China has recently become the world\u2019s largest economy, and more and more universities across the world are keen to partner with Chinese universities.\u201d It\u2019s not just China that\u2019s improving its standing, he adds. \u201cThere are institutions in Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan that have been very driven over the past few years and, in most cases, well funded. The partnerships that they\u2019ve been building with institutions in the west have helped slingshot them into higher positions.\u201d But Africa is also making its mark on the tables, according to Sowter who says that the introduction of new subject areas, such as development studies, is revealing new areas of academic excellence. \u201cWe\u2019ve introduced more subjects and so are now looking through a more powerful lens. There are nine African universities in the top 100 for development studies, including universities in Uganda, Kenya and Egypt as well as South Africa.\u201d It\u2019s more difficult to see which countries are falling behind, according to Sowter. \u201cOver the course of the last five years or so, we\u2019re seeing some continental European universities not doing as well as they might. The economic situation in southern Europe has set institutions back a little bit.\u201d How is the data collected? The subject rankings are based on research citations from Scopus data \u2013 this includes analysis from 17.3 million research papers and over 100 million citations \u2013 alongside reputational surveys of over 126,000 academics and graduate employers worldwide. This year, QS introduced six new subjects to the rankings: business and management, architecture, art &amp; design, dentistry, development studies and veterinary science.   This article was amended on 30 April to correct the number of subject areas that UK universities ranked top in.

Here\u2019s my plan to make it work for them | Marcus du Sautoy", "article": "The Labour party has made a commitment to ensure that every young person studies mathematics up to the age of 18. Of course, the people it will affect don\u2019t have the vote \u2013 although if it was up to Labour they would: to give 16- and 17-year-olds the right to vote is one of their other promises. But what about all those people who do have the vote? Would they have appreciated the chance to carry on their mathematical education, or were they only too happy to give it up as soon as they could?   Related: Labour plans for maths until 18 'best protection' against unemployment    The majority reaction is probably \u201clet me give it up\u201d \u2013 but changing that attitude is partly what this initiative is all about. Certainly not everyone is maths averse. Many employers are crying out for a more mathematically and scientifically literate workforce: 60% of UK companies are not confident they will have employees with the mathematical skills to meet the needs of an increasingly scientific future. As a country we are so short of engineers that we are barely able to fill half the engineering jobs that our technical age demands. You only have to look at those countries that make it compulsory to study maths to 18 \u2013 such as Taiwan and South Korea \u2013 to realise that it probably has a massive knock-on effect for the economic success of that country. The UK is an outlier when it comes to maths education post-16. Only a fifth of pupils in England currently carry on studying maths at any level after GCSEs \u2013 the lowest rate of 24 developed countries in a Nuffield Foundation survey, behind Estonia, France, the United States, Spain, Russia and China. But why should maths be privileged above learning a foreign language or history? Does everyone need to know what a cosine is if the UK is to have a brighter future? Does the success of our economy depend on every citizen feeling confident factorising a quadratic equation? It may come as a surprise to you that I don\u2019t think so, but I\u2019m still a big believer in teaching maths to 18. What will be important is making sure that the maths we expose students to is both relevant to their future and the future of our country.    Many of the best algorithms contain no numbers or equations at all, but are full of mathematical thinking    What many are not aware of is that maths is so much more than the technical cogs that currently form the backbone of the curriculum. It is about pattern searching, extended analytical and logical thinking, problem solving. I am just embarking on making a new programme for the BBC about the beauty of algorithms. Many of the best algorithms contain no numbers or equations at all, but are full of mathematical thinking. And it is those algorithms that are creating efficient approaches to a whole range of business solutions, from the distribution of goods from supermarket warehouses to decisions about flight schedules at\u00a0Heathrow airport. It is the same algorithmic mathematical thought process that feeds into even the efficient running of small-scale businesses or our public services, from running a restaurant to scheduling staff in a hospital. And it is sensitivity to a mathematical thought process that is going to enable people to construct a rational approach to each\u00a0challenge \u2013 an approach that doesn\u2019t require reinventing the wheel each time a new problem crops up. What about those humanities students or creative artists or vocational students who might argue that they will never need more maths? I believe that even these students, if exposed to the right curriculum, will recognise the benefits of more maths. I am doing an event with the Booker-winning novelist\u00a0Ben Okri at the Hay festival next month about the connections between mathematical proof and literary narrative. As a novelist, Okri is\u00a0the first to recognise the importance of a logically consistent narrative to the success of a novel \u2013 but also the wonderful benefit that a mathematical sensitivity to pattern and structure can give novelists as they create a narrative arch. From musical composition to carpentry, from street art to journalism, a mathematical mindset potentially gives one an edge. But here will be the challenge for any government keen to implement a post-16 mathematical commitment. For some students, learning more calculus and trigonometry will be just the right tools to equip them to give us the missing 50% of engineers we need. But perhaps, just as English splits into language and literature GCSEs, there is a place for a second maths GCSE course. This would expose students to the big ideas of maths: concepts of infinity, the maths of symmetry, the challenge of prime numbers. It is finding out what maths is really about that might change the national mindset to one that will thank a Labour government for the chance to continue mathematics to 18."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/apr/30/daniel-hahns-top-10-underrated-or-forgotten-childrens-classics", "publicationDate": "2015-04-30T11:07:42Z", "tags": ["Children and teenagers", "Teen books", "Children's books: 8-12 years", "Children's books: 7 and under", "Classics"], "sentences": ["Its fame is very widespread (just last week, in Italy, I met a publisher from Taiwan who named it her childhood favourite), but it\u2019s mostly ignored here in the UK, and it shouldn\u2019t be!"], "title": "Daniel Hahn's top 10 forgotten children's classics", "article": "For my list I\u2019ve chosen 10 works of children\u2019s fiction that I think don\u2019t receive enough attention. They\u2019re not known to millions of readers here in the UK, and they ought to be! 1. Fire, Bed and Bone by Henrietta Branford This slim book is one of the finest of all historical novels for young readers, I think. And it\u2019s narrated by a dog. But it\u2019s not a fluffy, cute or sentimental story, quite the contrary. Set during the Peasants\u2019 Revolt of 1381, which is seen through the experiences of a nameless old hunting dog, it\u2019s tough, tense and vivid. It\u2019s also, unlikely as this may sound, entirely believable. An astonishing achievement. 2. Tulku by Peter Dickinson Oh, read Peter Dickinson! I\u2019m recommending Tulku as a starter, but there are many gems to choose from. (His Changes trilogy is a masterpiece, by the way\u2026) Tulku is a historical novel set in China during the Boxer Rebellion. An American missionary\u2019s son flees from his ruined home and travels to Tibet, and discovers that life is more complicated (especially in terms of religion) than his father had taught him. It\u2019s complex, clever, dramatic, with some finely drawn characters \u2013 all of Dickinson\u2019s great strengths in one small book. Read it. And then read everything else he\u2019s written. (There\u2019s lots.) 3. Corbenic by Catherine Fisher I\u2019ve never understood why Catherine Fisher isn\u2019t one of the book world\u2019s superstars. She writes richly imagined dark fantasy, woven through with myth and legend, and all realised just beautifully. Corbenic \u2013 which has all these qualities \u2013 is a grail story filled with Arthurian legend, but it\u2019s also a completely contemporary book, with real characters with modern problems. Despite its ancient influences, it feels constantly fresh and utterly original. 4. Dinosaurs and All That Rubbish by Michael Foreman Foreman is a bit of a wizard of picture books, producing book after book full of wisdom and beauty, and this is one of his best. A man builds a space rocket, and ferocious dinosaurs are reawakened\u2026 But this isn\u2019t an adventure story, it\u2019s a clever, important, thought-provoking environmental fable. Rather incredibly, it was published over 40 years ago, and its message gets more relevant, not less, as the years go by. (Let\u2019s ignore just for a moment how sad that is\u2026) This one is essential reading for young children. And older children. And grown-ups. And, um, everyone else. 5. Badger on the Barge by Janni Howker I\u2019ve just written a new reference book, The Oxford Companion to Children\u2019s Literature, and a friend has already taken me to task for neglecting Janni Howker. And she\u2019s right, of course \u2013 Howker has written relatively few books, but they\u2019re exceptionally good. Badger on the Barge, her debut, is unusual in that it\u2019s a collection of short stories, five of them, each looking thoughtfully at a relationship between a young character and an old one. And the writing is just stunning \u2013 it\u2019s not always a simple read, but more than repays the effort.     There\u2019s No Such Things as a Dragon...but hunt one down if you can! Photograph: PR    6. There\u2019s No Such Thing as a Dragon by Jack Kent One of my favourites when I was small, and like any personal favourite I simply cannot understand why it\u2019s not everyone else\u2019s favourite, too! It\u2019s the story of a small boy called Billy Bixbee, who wakes up one morning to find a very small dragon in his room \u2013 but his mother won\u2019t believe him, saying very sensibly \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a dragon\u201d. But then, bit by bit, page by page, the dragon starts to grow\u2026 This book isn\u2019t all that easy to find nowadays (I\u2019ve given so many as presents I feel I may have bought most of the existing copies myself\u2026) but it\u2019s worth hunting down \u2013 it\u2019s so very good. (And though, yes, it\u2019s for relatively young children, there are bits that still make me laugh and I\u2019m 41.)          7. From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs Basil E Frankweiler by EL Konigsburg This one\u2019s an absolute classic in America, and has been since it won the prestigious Newbery medal almost half a century ago. Its fame is very widespread (just last week, in Italy, I met a publisher from Taiwan who named it her childhood favourite), but it\u2019s mostly ignored here in the UK, and it shouldn\u2019t be! It\u2019s great. It\u2019s the story of Claudia and Jamie, who run away from home and move instead into New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Mrs Frankweiler of the title, the book\u2019s narrator, is a rich, elderly eccentric, who has sold the museum a renaissance statue which the children believe is by Michelangelo. Brilliant. Fortunately this one\u2019s being reissued by a British publisher this year, and you can see for yourself.      8. Fattypuffs and Thinifers by Andr\u00e9 Maurois, translated by Norman Denny This is a pretty well-known book, but I\u2019ve chosen it because of the illustrator, Fritz Wegner. Wegner, who died last month, was never the household name he deserved to be, even if his illustrations are recognisable to anyone who\u2019s seen them \u2013 and the ones in Fattypuffs and Thinifers are some of his best. Two boys travel underground to a pair of enemy kingdoms, inhabited by fattypuffs and thinifers, respectively \u2013 it\u2019s a terrifically fun story, full of pleasingly surreal inventiveness; but it\u2019s Wegner\u2019s hilarious, irresistible illustrations that make it for me. They do that thing all great illustrations do, making it quite impossible to imagine the story existing without them. 9. Conrad (sometimes called The Factory-Made Boy) by Christine N\u00f6stlinger, translated by Anthea Bell N\u00f6stlinger is one of the best children\u2019s writers of our time, but she\u2019s practically unknown in the UK. (We have a rather bad habit here of reading only writers who write originally in English, and ignoring those writers whose work could be translated for us from other languages.) This is one I remember from my own childhood reading, a brilliantly funny story about conformity (or otherwise). In it, a rather eccentric woman, Mrs Bartolotti, receives a parcel in the post containing a factory-made child called Conrad, who is perfect in every way (and much better behaved than his new parent); but the factory have made a mistake and soon they want him back\u2026 10. Don\u2019t Let Go by Jeanne Willis and Tony Ross Willis and Ross have collaborated on so many famous picture-books, but this is my all-time favourite of theirs \u2013 it\u2019s the simple, rhyming story of a girl learning to ride a bike, and it\u2019s joyful and heart-breaking all at the same time. (Quite apart from children liking it, I defy any parent to read this one without a tear in their eye.) Not enough people know this book, but it\u2019s much loved by those clever people who do\u2026      And oh, these but also so many others. Honestly, do you have any idea how hard it is to choose just 10?

The other three are arguably her successors: Carol Morley, Joanna Hogg and Clio Barnard, each of whom will be appearing in discussion alongside one of their own films. In a similar vein, another highlight of the festival is a screening of Peter Strickland\u2019s gorgeous The Duke Of Burgundy, which will be accompanied by a live score from Cats\u2019 Eyes (22 May). Various venues, Sat to 24 May Chinese Visual Festival, London Despite a huge season at the BFI last year, we\u2019ve still barely scratched the surface of Chinese cinema. But the curators of this festival have been scouring mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore to bring a more complete picture. There are more than 40 films here, and names to acquaint yourself with include Gu Tao, who records disappearing traditions in his latest, The Last Moose Of Aoluguya (Fri), Zhang Peili, AKA \u201cthe father of Chinese video art\u201d, and Zhou Hou, whose award-winning Cotton (11 May) gives a personal slant to modern Chinese labour conditions. Other highlights include Meeting Dr Sun (22 May), a lively high-school heist comedy from Taiwan. Various venues, Thu to 22 May UK Green Film Festival, Nationwide Not a party-affiliated election event, but instead a focus on environmental issues far bigger than national politics (though it\u2019s all political, of course). Seven recent documentaries play in more than 20 UK cities and towns, most of them focusing on local issues with global resonance.

Much of this was down to Gustavs Erenpreiss, whose innovative and durable designs were favoured by everyone from housewives to Latvia\u2019s 1936 Olympic team. In 1937, Erenpreiss shifted his operations to an enormous purpose-built factory, amid forecasts that there would be five times as many bicycles in Riga by 1990. However, this all-too-brief golden era came to an end in 1942, when the Erenpreiss factory was taken over by the Soviets, who eventually used it to produce mopeds. Erenpreiss himself left for Germany in 1944, and died in exile 12 years later, having never returned to his homeland.     Gustavs Erenpreiss in exile in 1955. Photograph: Erenpreiss    The Soviets finally left in the early 90s but when I visited Riga recently, I was surprised to find that, some 20 years on, many Latvians are still coming to terms with their freedom; attempting to recall and revive a national identity that was long suppressed, and finally facing up to decades of suffering and humiliation. The guides at the notorious KGB building, opened to the public only last year, told me that they are still reconstructing the events that took place there, from the often harrowing testimonies of former prisoners who have screwed up the courage to revisit the site of their incarceration. And 10 years ago, acting on his lifelong obsession with bicycles, the great-grand-nephew of Gustavs Erenpriess decided to strike his own blow against Latvians\u2019 collective amnesia, by bringing the old brand back to life. I met Toms Erenpreiss at a party following Riga\u2019s annual Tweed Run.     Toms Erenpreiss, great-grand-nephew of Gustavs Erenpriess. Photograph: Stefan Jacobs/Erenpreiss    Toms is almost entirely self-taught. He restored his first vintage bicycle at the age of 12, and has spent the intervening years poring over books and websites, and picking the brains of Latvia\u2019s few surviving bike builders. After serving his apprenticeship by restoring over 100 bicycles, he designed and produced a new range of Erenpreiss bicycles in 2012, combining his great-grand-uncle\u2019s tried and tested methods with modern innovations such as a Sram 2-speed coaster brake. They sold out within three weeks. The new bikes are manufactured in Taiwan, with the Riga operations devoted to restoration, so in some ways Erenpreiss HQ is very much as it would have been 60 years ago. Sales manager Ance Pud\u0101ne led me into the bowels of the workshop, where racks of ancient dust-covered bicycles hung from the walls, waiting to be dismantled for parts, and neatly labelled shelves and drawers bulged with rusted handlebars, forks, cranksets, hubs, contorted leather saddles, and everything else that might possibly be salvaged from a 70-year-old bicycle that has spent the last few years in someone\u2019s attic or back garden. Ance, who is also a restorer with a degree in metalwork, explained that some of the parts they receive are so corroded by long neglect that they fall apart when she tries to clean them. Usually the team will wait until a project comes in \u2013 often an original Erenpreiss \u2013 and then ransack their extensive collection to identify and refurbish the parts that will restore it to its former glory and, most importantly, get it back on the road. Of course the Erenpreiss team are setting themselves a high bar. Many have remarked that, if Toms has done his job properly, the bikes now flying in from Taiwan will last as long as their 1930s ancestors. Ance led me over to a display of these recent arrivals. \u201cDo you want to ride one?\u201d she asked. Of course I did.     One of the modern Erenpreiss models, the Paula. Photograph: Erenpreiss    I was given a sleek \u2013 and surprisingly light \u2013 bicycle with a step-through frame and swept-back bars wrapped in soft brown leather. Since I generally ride a road bike, the first few seconds were alarmingly wobbly, and a few people smirked as I swung my leg over the saddle, rather than demurely stepping through the frame as nature and Erenpreiss intended. But then I was off, flying along smoothly, comfortably and speedily, bumping gently over the cobbles that still line the streets of Riga, marveling at how little, really, the bicycle has changed in all those years \u2013 indeed, how little it ever needed to change. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 May 2015.

Calls to restaurants, massage parlours and tea shops that advertised on the websites backpackers.com.tw and tigtag.com uncovered numerous cases of below-award wages for jobs targeted at Chinese-speaking students and visitors on working holidays. The investigation was carried out with the advocacy group Taiwanese Working Holiday Youth (TWHY). Most of the jobs offered were with relatively small, family-owned businesses, but in one case the man who answered said he was hiring for a Sydney branch of the Taiwanese teahouse chain Chatime. The global franchise has more than 1,000 branches, including 60 in Australia. He said the service role based in the Sydney suburb of Parramatta paid working holidaymakers $9 an hour for the first month and $11 an hour thereafter. Payment was to be cash in hand, but a tax file number was required. The full-time adult award rate for a food and beverage attendant is $17.35. Overseas visitors must be over 18 to be on a working holiday visa in Australia. Chatime Australia confirmed with Guardian Australia the ad was for a job at the company\u2019s Paramatta store but said as it was a franchise the company was not involved in the hiring of employees.  A spokesman said via email: \u201cChatime franchisees fully understand their rights and obligations to their employees. This is something that is continually communicated to them. We certainly take these accusations seriously and we will pursue the matter further with the franchisee in question.\u201d  The Parramatta branch of Chatime did not respond to calls. A Japanese restaurant in Melbourne offered working holidaymakers $10 an hour. A Brisbane massage parlour offered 45% commission of all bookings with no basic wage. Inexperienced staff were expected to do one week of training without pay. A contracting company advertised for a fruit picking job in central Queensland with a piece rate of 11 cents to 14 cents per branch picked and no basic wage. TWHY spokesman Yao-Tai Li said working holidaymakers often did not complain to authorities about pay and conditions because they lacked confidence in their English. Along with low wages, workers also often faced long hours, poor work conditions and, in some cases, sexual harassment by their employers, Li said. The treasurer, Joe Hockey, announced in this week\u2019s budget that working holidaymakers will be taxed on every dollar, instead of being able to claim the $18,200 tax-free threshold. The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) was unable to comment on individual cases, but said there were nearly 1 million recently-arrived visa-holders with working rights in Australia. An FWO spokeswoman told Guardian Australia overseas workers could be vulnerable if they were not fully aware of their workplace rights or were reluctant to complain.  \u201cWe are conscious that youth, language and cultural barriers can also create difficulties for overseas workers,\u201d she said. One in 10 requests for assistance to the FWO are now from from visa-holders working in Australia, more than ever before. \u201cThat\u2019s significant and is a trend that is concerning us greatly,\u201d the spokeswoman said. Of the workers who contacted the FWO, 60% were male, more than a third were aged 26-30 and most were born in Korea, China, Germany, France or India.  Industries known to employ significant numbers of overseas workers include horticulture, cleaning, convenience stores and trolley collecting. A recent Four Corners report investigated the use of foreign workers in the fruit picking industry and poultry factories, with one Queensland grower equating the work conditions and pay to \u201cslave labour\u201d. But the largest number of requests for assistance from overseas workers, nearly one in four, come from employees in the accommodation and food services sectors. The FWO established an overseas workers\u2019 team (OWT) in 2012. In the first nine months of the current financial year, it recouped $1.2m in underpayments for 345 visa-holders, surpassing last year\u2019s figure of $1.1m. The spokeswoman said it was impossible to visit every workplace in Australia to carry out checks, \u201cand nor should we\u201d.   \u201cEducation is equally as important as deterrence in achieving compliance with workplace laws.\u201d  The ombudsman has an interpreter service and educational material translated into 27 languages, including Chinese. A recent campaign targeted overseas workers with advertisements in Korean on Korean websites.     A Fair Work Ombudsman campaign ad written in Korean.

Photograph: Australian Government: Fair Work Ombudsman    Workers from non-English speaking backgrounds have extremely limited access to the Fair Work system and a large number of Australian employers \u201chave turned this knowledge into a profitable business model\u201d, Jo Schofield, national president of the union for hospitality workers United Voice Workers said. A report by United Voice showed extensive exploitation of international students in Melbourne\u2019s office cleaning industry where some were underpaid up to $15,000 per year. Union members have proposed \u201cwhistleblower\u201d protections for foreign workers and the introduction of an immigration inspectorate at the FWO. Schofield said workers\u2019 rights are best protected where there are enough people to support each other, so small businesses pose the greatest challenge. \u201cDodgy employers are often masters of re-invention: when they are discovered, they shut up shop and re-emerge, rebranded in a new location.\u201d Unions should be given better access to workplaces to assist workers who may have breached their visa conditions without the threat of deportation to allow them to create the conditions needed to work legitimately, she said. Ten, a former backpacker and massage therapist from Taiwan, got a job at a Sydney massage parlour in 2013 (he withheld his real name due to signing a non-disclosure agreement). Among the parlour\u2019s 10 staff members, he said, only two were experienced masseurs. The rest were students with little or no experience. The parlour\u2019s owner, a woman from Beijing who had lived in Australian for more than 20 years, told Ten his pay consisted of commission only \u2013 45% of any booking. The owner demanded he fill out falsified masseuse accreditation, he said. \u201cWhen I refused she rolled the certificate up and bopped me on the head!\u201d Ten said. After two weeks, Ten resigned. He made several requests for his pay, which were ignored. Ten said for most backpackers the story would end there. Most choose to cut their losses and hope that the terms and conditions of their next job will be better. \u201cChinese and Taiwanese people are afraid of going through the legal process,\u201d said Ten, or are limited by their lack of English proficiency. But he filed a complaint with the FWO, then took the matter to the small claims court when his employer failed to appear at scheduled mediation sessions. After nine months, and having enlisted the services of a pro bono lawyer, he received amounts equalling the minimum award wage, tax and superannuation \u2013 almost double the amount of the original cheque. He said that persistence was \u201cvery, very, very uncommon\u201d among his peers, but he hoped his actions would help improve the situation for backpackers in Australia. Stories of working-holidaymaker exploitation in Australia have found their way back to Taiwanese media. In one account, a 26-year-old Taiwanese backpacker recounted being paid $14 an hour at a Thai restaurant. Fulfilling any dream of getting rich in Australia was impossible, the backpacker said, \u201cnot unless you eat nothing, drink nothing and sleep by the side of the road\u201d.  Li, from the TWHY, said that no matter how low the wages offered, \u201cthere will always be people willing to do the job\u201d. But it was unfair working conditions \u2013 not backpackers \u2013 that should attract criticism and that needed government action.   \u201cIt\u2019s not a unique problem, that\u2019s only applicable to Taiwanese or other pan-Chinese migrants or students. It\u2019s a widespread, common phenomenon around Australia. Lots of people doing these \u2018black market jobs\u2019 are local Australians.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/18/universal-health-coverage-private-sector-world-health-organisation", "publicationDate": "2015-05-18T08:00:01Z", "tags": ["Private sector", "Global development", "Health", "World Health Organisation", "World news"], "sentences": ["Expanding health insurance coverage to poor people, allowing them to freely access private providers, is well underway in Ghana, Thailand, Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia and many other countries."], "title": "Universal health coverage and private hospitals are not mutually exclusive | Dominic Montagu", "article": "This week health ministers from around the world gather in Geneva for the annual meeting of the World Health Organisation (WHO). While they will no doubt take some time to enjoy the beautiful scenery, their working agenda will cover some of the world\u2019s biggest health challenges, including planning for the next pandemic Ebola and influenza outbreaks. Decisions will also be made on topics that are less alarming but equally important for health. Chief among these is how to encourage developing countries to move towards universal health coverage (UHC), in which everyone in a country can access basic health services without facing financial hardship. The WHO director general, Margaret Chan, has described UHC as \u201cthe single most powerful concept that public health has to offer\u201d. Given that 150 million people each year suffer financial catastrophe due to paying for healthcare, this is no exaggeration.   Related: 'My mother did everything but she was left to bleed to death after giving birth' | Alon Mwesigwa    UHC now tops the domestic agenda in countries from India to Uganda, thanks partly to WHO-led advocacy. But progress is being complicated by a needless debate about the role of the private sector in healthcare provision in poor countries. Oxfam, which has the ear of many development officials, summed it up in a series of papers attacking private sector involvement in healthcare, describing it as \u201cunregulated, unaccountable, and out of control\u201d.  According to this view, which is shared by many western aid agencies, UHC can only be achieved by a massive expansion of government-owned hospitals and clinics in developing countries.   The idea that involving the private sector is antithetical to UHC is bizarre. The private sector (which includes non-profit providers) forms the backbone of healthcare in a range of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries including Japan, South Korea and Germany. In fact, more than two-thirds of all OECD countries rely mostly on private outpatient care and some of the best performing countries also deliver the majority of inpatient care through private hospitals. All of these countries have achieved both universal coverage and high levels of patient satisfaction.  The private sector also provides up to 80% of healthcare in many developing countries. Proponents of public sector care are therefore effectively asking governments to massively expand government health provision in order to duplicate existing hospitals, doctors, labs, clinics, blood banks, maternity homes, and pharmacies.  This is not only an unrealistic proposition, it is also pointless. There is no evidence that government control is the only way to achieve UHC. Quite the opposite: the evidence suggests there are many ways to get to UHC, and advising countries otherwise will drive them into needless, substantial spending to replicate resources that already exist.  Harnessing the private sector to achieve UHC need not be traumatic. National or social health insurance schemes should be agnostic about whom they purchase services from: private or public, so long as quality, fairness and cost standards are met.    The idea that involving the private sector is antithetical to universal health coverage is bizarre     This approach works well in many developing countries. Certain districts in Thailand have achieved UHC by allowing all residents to use private hospitals, and then reimbursing those facilities. In the Philippines, growing numbers of pregnant women use private midwives, reimbursed by the national social health insurance fund, PhilHealth.  Expanding health insurance coverage to poor people, allowing them to freely access private providers, is well underway in Ghana, Thailand, Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia and many other countries. A host of other countries are moving towards this approach, including Kenya, Indonesia, India and Uganda. The idea that such \u201ctawdry\u201d notions as profit and business have no room in healthcare is perhaps understandable among those who have made a career in public health, and whose motivations are altruistic rather than financial. Even a cursory examination of most health systems, however, reveals that very few countries can meet this high moral standard: pharmacies in the UK, France, and in most other countries are private, profit-driven, and most effective when they are well-run businesses. Dental services in most countries are private, as are outpatient clinics. Good care is still delivered. High-quality medicines can still be found at Boots, Watsons, or Walgreens.  As a growing number of developing countries stand ready to redouble their financial and political commitments to making healthcare more accessible to their citizens, we do them no favours by giving them ideologically-driven advice.  Cuba has the best health system in the world according to the WHO, and Brits are impressively vocal about their love of the NHS. But surveys tell us that the Dutch, Germans, and Japanese, though not as vocal, are no less satisfied with their private-delivery-based health systems. The WHO and the supportive aid ministries in the developed world should provide the best objective advice and evidence to developing countries on this topic. UHC is the goal; let\u2019s not be sidetracked by pointless debates about getting \u201cmy way\u201d or \u201cyour way\u201d. However we arrive at our goal, a great many people will benefit.  \u2022 Dominic Montagu is associate professor of epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/censorship-in-hong-kong-how-china-controls-sale-of-sensitive-books", "publicationDate": "2015-05-19T00:00:04Z", "tags": ["Hong Kong", "China", "Censorship"], "sentences": ["\u201cTaiwan translated it, but the Hong Kong authorities did not allow for it to be published and distributed here,\u201d he says."], "title": "Creeping censorship in Hong Kong: how China controls sale of sensitive books", "article": "The shop assistant is abrupt when the question comes. \u201cWe are not going to sell that one.

On the surface, there seems to be no censorship in Hong Kong. Unlike the mainland, the web is free, a wide range of newspapers is available, TV news covers demonstrations and protests, and nobody needs to apply for permission to print books. \u201cIn 40 years, I know of only one book that has ever been stopped from distribution,\u201d says Wong Sheung Wai, director of Greenfield Bookstore, a shop and distribution company, \u201cand that was the Chinese translation of a guide to suicide.  \u201cTaiwan translated it, but the Hong Kong authorities did not allow for it to be published and distributed here,\u201d he says. But mounting pressure from China to have greater control over what the Hong Kong public, and the Chinese tourists flocking there, read is creeping into this former British colony. Through a complex web of self-censorship, soft censorship and mainland economic control, bookshops and media outlets in the territory have been changing their tone or giving less coverage to topics that China deems sensitive.     Zhao Ziyang\u2019s memoir, Prisoner of the State, about the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in 1989. Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP    A slow but steady \u201cmainlandisation\u201d of Hong Kong, a key factor in bringing tens of thousands of protesters to the streets during last year\u2019s umbrella movement, has been changing the face of the publishing and book distribution industry, with fewer shops willing, or able, to sell books forbidden in China. Booming real estate costs add to that problem. \u201cReaders\u2019 numbers are going down everywhere, and nobody can afford a ground-floor bookshop unless they are backed by people with very deep pockets,\u201d says one publishing industry insider. The three main local bookshop chains, with a total of 51 outlets, are controlled by the Liaison Office, Beijing\u2019s official representation in Hong Kong, which, she adds, makes sure they only pay a nominal rent for their operations. That the Liaison Office is controlling most media in Hong Kong has been raising concerns. Recently, an article in the Chinese language Apple Daily (the only newspaper in Hong Kong completely independent of mainland influences) detailed how, at times through shell companies, the office controls 100% of Joint Publishing, Commercial Publishing and Chung Hwa Books, the three main bookshop chains, fully owned subsidiaries of Sino-United Publishing. The Liaison Office also controls two newspapers (Ta Kung Pao and Wen Hui Pao) and three magazines, according to Apple Daily. \u201cIf you ask me what is the biggest problem that Hong Kong faces right now,\u201d says Alex Chow, one of the student leaders at last year\u2019s protests, \u201cit is the Liaison Office, and their growing involvement in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs.\u201d Renee Chiang, of New Century Press, an independent publisher that prints many politically sensitive books, says: \u201cEven the three big chains are commercial interests, so they do try to sell what clients want. At times certain books disliked by the Chinese authorities will still be available, but hidden behind a counter, or piled up with the spine turned to the walls.  \u201cIn the past two years, though, things have been tightened up further. There used to be a table in the Chinese-backed bookshops which we called the \u2018jinshu books table\u2019, where forbidden books could be bought. It has disappeared from every shop. The only place that still has it is the airport, but they hide it at the back.\u201d One of Joint Publishing\u2019s largest branches, in Queen\u2019s Road Central, proves the point. A three-floor outlet, until a few months ago it used to have a big jinshu table crammed with titles banned in the mainland: mostly unofficial biographies of the main Chinese political leaders, past and present, and volumes that promise to reveal all the murkiest secrets behind high-profile trials \u2013 especially those that involve political, economic or sexual scandals. Zhao\u2019s Prisoner of the State, published by New Century Press, which detailed how the decision to open fire on unarmed protesters in 1989 was taken, is not available in Hong Kong despite previously selling 150,000 copies in a market where 2,000 is deemed a good return. Another book, by the same publishing house, To Be a Citizen: My Free China, by the lawyer and pro-democracy activist Xu Zhiyong (who is serving a four-year prison sentence for \u201cgathering a crowd to disturb public order\u201d), is not on the shelves, and any order for it receives a shake of the head. The censorship is subtle enough, though. On the ground floor, where books on Hong Kong are located, the are plenty of titles on the umbrella movement and people browse through them openly. However, those most prominently displayed are critical of the Occupy movement. \u201cThings have been changing dramatically in the last two years.

Its $154.1m six-day Chinese debut was impressive \u2013 the second-highest ever in the territory and evidence of how the Marvel universe is now establishing itself in the farthest corners of the real one. But it\u2019s short of the truly ridiculous pace, $250.5m in eight days, set by Furious 7 in April. Both films are in the running for the No 3 spot, currently held by the first Avengers, on the all-time worldwide chart: Furious 7, its takings slowing to a crawl now, is about $20m short; Ultron about $380m. Ultron looks, right now, to be slightly off Furious 7\u2019s blistering overseas pace, and also unlikely to match the $623.7m US haul that was the foundation of the first Avengers\u2019 massive strike.               It\u2019s still doing very capably on both counts: ahead of Avengers 1 in most emerging markets, which should balance out the reduced US pot \u2013 now $372m, the year\u2019s highest domestic figure so far. What it\u2019s lacking is that hot twitch of cultural excitement that would set it on the way to break records absolutely everywhere; it\u2019s notable that the UK box office is also running shy of the first film\u2019s at the same point ($65.9m to the first\u2019s $71.2m). But there\u2019s still a lot to play for. If I was betting, then I\u2019d put money on Furious 7 finishing a fraction above Avengers 1, and Ultron a fraction below. Mad world              After his 30-year absence, there was no guarantee audiences would be keen on another parched excursion in the company of Max Rockatansky. Very much a low-budget, midnight-movie kind of proposition for the first two Mad Maxes, building up to something of Hollywood stature for the third, there\u2019s no mistaking the pressure this time. A $150m budget plus a rumoured $100m in marketing putting Fury Road \u2013 releasing in 69 territories \u2013 puts Fury Road in the indisputable worldwide blockbuster ballpark.  A $45.4m US opening in that context looks like a disappointment, but given that the film is R-rated and, with Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron headlining, contains no A-list stars, it\u2019s a qualified success (the 24th best R-rated debut). It\u2019s the best Mad Max debut \u2013 and puts Fury Road in a strong position to become the top-grossing film of the series, even adjusted for inflation (which would lift Beyond Thunderdome\u2019s $36.2m to $82.8m). Given the almost unanimously worshipful reviews, studio Warner Bros will be hoping that George Miller\u2019s film has the same kind of durability at the box-office as its protagonist does in the outback.  Even if that comes to pass, the international figures are concerning \u2013 $64m from 68 markets \u2013 set against meaty costs. That doesn\u2019t say must-see blockbuster to me; more cult breakout that you pray doesn\u2019t have a three-figure-budget. Fury Road\u2019s $7m UK figure was beaten into second place by Pitch Perfect 2, but still enough to make it top territory; $6.6m was enough for No 1 in South Korea and $6.1m for France; but $4.9m in Australia has to be counted as a stumble, given the franchise\u2019s uniquely screwy antipodean identity.  Compared to other adult-certified films that have performed better (Fifty Shades of Grey opened at $20.8m in the UK in February), Fury Road feels like it\u2019s labouring to get much beyond the geek quorum that remembers and reveres the original films. Hopefully, the film\u2019s superior quality will change that over the coming weeks. But it\u2019s a problem for now. It feels like Fury Road is suffering because it\u2019s up against Pitch Perfect 2 in many countries, whose easy mainstream hooks are picking up the female audience more readily (see below) than the abstract case for Miller\u2019s film as an anti-patriarchal work that emerged when the reviews embargo was lifted on 11 May. There was no sense in the long-term marketing campaign that this could be a selling point for the film \u2013 and a 70% male US audience on opening weekend is the result.  Bravura trailers aside, the publicity was rather diffuse, with Charlize Theron\u2019s shaven-headed Furiosa mystifyingly prominent on posters at the expense of Tom Hardy, the ostensible star of the show. There was also an impersonal poster campaign that relied on bland road-warrior imagery that would only resonate with Mad Max aficionados, and a \u201cmastermind\u201d billing for dirctor George Miller that, again, preaches largely to the converted.  It feels as if there wasn\u2019t a clear sense of who to aim Fury Road at beyond the cult-movie crowd, or that someone lacked the conviction to sell it to women because of the fear of losing the male audience. Now, if the film is to meet its costs, the studio is partly reliant on the last people they usually ask to sell stuff for them: the critics. Sweet harmony              Pitch Perfect 2 is going to be big. The US opening for Universal\u2019s a cappella comedy sequel \u2013 $69.2m, easily a record for a musical \u2013 confirms that the franchise is firmly bedded in when, back in 2012, it was a quirky proposition feeding off the likes of Glee and given a limited, slow-building release. That could put it in line for $150-200m in the US alone. It\u2019s a calculated retread, with university singing outfit the Barden Bellas pushed on to the international a cappella scene for no other reason than that\u2019s where the bigger box office lies.  It\u2019s also spectacularly outperforming the first film in the 30 markets where it\u2019s out so far. After an upper-register No 1 in Australia last week, co-star Rebel Wilson\u2019s home turf, it\u2019s going great guns in the UK (PP1: $1.5m; PP2: $7.7m) and Germany (PP1: $1.9m; PP2: $4.1m), who were the next hottest for the original. The Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan also posted No 1s, suggesting that Pitch Perfect is breaking new ground, perhaps already tilled by the greater visibility of female-led studio fare since Bridesmaids, and the fact that Pitch Perfect shares the aspirational dramatic set-up of TV talent shows that are syndicated worldwide.  It\u2019ll surely surpass the original\u2019s $50.3m overseas take several times over, which could add up to $300m+ overall; enough to have it ululating alongside the likes of Into the Woods ($212m), Chicago ($306m) and Les Mis\u00e9rables ($441m). A third round seems inevitable, and the franchise, with its transportable tight unit of singers and college setting, surely has potential to bud off into localised versions, too.  The rest of the world            Four offerings from outside the Hollywood system: Korean thriller Chronicles of Evil, left eating Mad Max\u2019s dirt in second place in that country but still good for sixth place globally, about a police officer who covers up the murder of a taxi driver. Two British entrants \u2013 Ex Machina and Far From the Madding Crowd \u2013 continued modest international runs in eight and 13 territories respectively. Now at $26.5m and 11th place on the worldwide rankings, Alex Garland\u2019s $16.4m sci-fi thriller must be hitting black some time soon; one place below and currently on $10.6m, it looks more dicey for Madding Crowd, for which no budget is available but which certainly looks glossy enough. But it\u2019s got a lengthy rollout to come, including major territories in the shape of France (3 June), Australia (25 June), Brazil (25 June) and Russia (2 July). Finally, Ostwind 2 \u2013 which looks to have a sort of German Black Beauty thing going on \u2013 took 13th place with a $2m take. The future            Mad Max: Fury Road and Pitch Perfect 2 dribble out in a few more spots. But if Marvel\u2019s owner Disney is fretting about the next big boy with a real chance of cramping Age of Ultron\u2019s style, it can console itself with the fact that it is a Disney film, too. Pixar alumnus Brad Bird brings his $190m sci-fi fantasia Tomorrowland \u2013 the latest in that beloved oeuvre based on theme-park rides \u2013 to 40 territories, including the US and the UK. In what seems like an emerging pattern lately, it\u2019ll open in China belatedly mid-week. Anything to do with government-stipulated release dates trying to depress Hollywood grosses? (If so, it\u2019s not working if Furious 7 and Ultron are anything to go by.) Fox\u2019s reboot of the Poltergeist property created in 1982 with Tobe Hooper as director and Steven Spielberg producing also hits 30 markets, chief among them the States, UK, Australia and Brazil, as well as a big swathe of the Middle East. The new one comes courtesy of Monster House director Gil Kenan and producers Sam Raimi and Roy Lee, the man who strip-mined J-horror for Hollywood remakes. Light on star names \u2013 just Sam Rockwell \u2013 it has the original\u2019s impressive $121m haul ($296m adjusted) to beat.  Top 10 global box office, 15-17 May 1.

CNN reported that a Chinese naval vessel issued eight warnings to the US plane on Wednesday, in an apparent effort to establish a no-fly zone near the artificial islands.

Books, electronic gizmos, even clothes and shoes. But bikes? Can you really decide on a bike \u2013 especially a flashy carbon fibre-framed one costing north of \u00a31,000 \u2013 without first having a test ride? The answer is yes, and a lot of people do. There\u2019s a few reasons. Firstly, if you already own a bike of roughly the same style you can compare the frame dimensions and angles and have a pretty good guess at what might work. Also, the fiddly elements \u2013 stem length, saddle adjustment etc \u2013 can be amended or swapped without too much fuss. Then, as with most internet shopping, if you get the frame size wrong you can return the whole bike, albeit in a very big box. Finally, the internet is awash with bike reviews, giving an impression of how a particular model feels, its strengths and quirks.  But most of all, people buy bikes over the internet because it can bring astonishing value for money. A series of web-only bike brands have sprung up over recent years, eschewing the cost of showrooms or retailer mark-ups to offer significantly more bike for your cash.  Overall, is it worth it? I decided to see by testing out road bikes from three predominantly web-only marques (all do have showrooms, but only one or a handful, so of little use to most customers).  The plan was to focus on bikes costing about \u00a31,000. However, the limited availability of test machines in my size meant they ended up that bit more posh, a hardship I endured as best I could. In each case I tried to act as much as possible as a paying customer, browsing the size guides on the websites and deciding on a frame and stem I thought best. Overall, it worked pretty well. With two of the three bikes the fit was perfect, and with the third I was almost exactly between frame sizes anyway, so even a brief test ride might not have helped. These are, on the face of it, broadly similar bikes, all with carbon frames, and featuring components from industry behemoths Shimano or Sram. But they are very different to ride. Finally, the usual caveats apply. I\u2019m not arguing that anyone, let alone everyone, \u201cneeds\u201d an expensive, high-tech road bike. That 30-year-old steel-framed clunker you rescued from a skip (or, as in my case, a \u00a3150 second-hand Dutch bike) might be perfectly fine for everyday needs. But the bikes below are generally used for longer-distance sport or leisure riding. Yes, \u00a31,500 is a lot for a bike, but not so much when compared with, say, a car, or a jet ski. It\u2019s all relative. I\u2019m listing the bikes purely in the order I tested them, not as any sort of league table. Canyon Endurace CF 8.0 - \u00a31,299     The Canyon Endurace CF 8.0. Photograph: Canyon    Despite their anglicised name, Canyon are based in the German city of Koblenz. As with all the bikes tested here, while they\u2019re designed by the company, the frames are manufactured in Asia, in this case Taiwan. Canyon\u2019s top-end bikes are used by two top-level professional teams, Movistar and Katusha, and if you have more than \u00a33,000 burning a hole in your bank account you can ride an identical machine. The model I tried out is a bit less gung ho. The Endurace, as the name suggests, is designed more for long-distance comfort as flat-out sprinting, more specifically the sportive, those often long but generally relaxed one-day events increasingly popular with road bike riders. Canyon have a flashy gizmo on their website to gauge your perfect bike size from body measurements you enter. This told me I needed a large frame, which sounded too big for my 5ft 10ins. Guessing the result might have been skewed by the fact my tape measure assistant was my four-year-old son, I instead went for a medium, or 56cm, frame, which was perfect. As with many modern carbon bikes, the Endurance frame is shaped in all sorts of clever ways, some parts large and super-stiff so your pedalling power is transmitted efficiently, others slim and reed-like, to make the ride that bit less bone shaking. Further increasing the comfort level are 25mm-thick Continental GP 4000s tyres \u2013 if there was ever a Nobel prize for bike tyres these would surely win \u2013 and a space age-looking split carbon seatpost, which works as a sort of leaf spring. Overall, you get a lot of of bike for your \u00a31,300. On to a \u00a3900 list price frameset go some fairly posh DT Swiss wheels and an 11-speed Shimano 105 groupset. Even the tyres would officially set you back \u00a380 a pair. The effect is quite magical \u2013 one of the most intuitive, trustworthy and comfortable lightweight road bikes you can imagine. I tried the Canyon out on a sopping wet, hilly, 70-mile April sportive, on back roads sufficiently covered in muck to leave the new brake pads half-flat by the end.  Throughout it all the bike didn\u2019t flinch or falter, with every corner handled confidently, every gear change a satisfyingly precise click. Almost as notable was how the bike felt nearer home. Carbon-frame bikes are known for being forgiving, but the Canyon made the rutted, potholed south London roads feel as close to comfortable as you\u2019ll get on such a machine. With all this comes some compromise. By most standards the Canyon is super light \u2013 a claimed weight without pedals of about 7.5kg \u2013 and very nippy.  But it is built for easier riding. Mine came with a relatively vast 11-32 tooth cassette, encouraging knee-friendly sit-down climbs rather than out-of-the-saddle grinds. And it is slightly if noticeably less responsive than more racy bikes. There is just not quite the same visceral connection between the force from your legs and resultant surge in speed. Does that make it less fun? That\u2019s up to you. Rose X-lite CRS 4000 - \u00a32,304     The Rose X-Lite CRS-4000. Photograph: Rose    When this arrived at the office I got a call from the post room. \u201cThere\u2019s a bike box arrived for you,\u201d they said. \u201cI think it\u2019s empty.\u201d A short pause. \u201cOh, hang on, there is something inside.\u201d The mistake was understandable: this machine from another German web behemoth has a measly claimed weight of just over 6.3kg, below the legal minimum for top-end racing. To be fair, it is a more expensive bike than I\u2019d intended, as Rose\u2019s tiny UK operation possesses just a handful of test machines. This one was fitted with Shimano\u2019s Dura Ace components, a good \u00a31,000-worth of pro-level kit. But even the more comparable next model down, fitted with Shimano\u2019s Ultegra and costing \u00a31,668 (Rose\u2019s sterling prices are pegged to euro rates, hence the oddly precise numbers), weighs a mere 6.75kg. I opted for a 57cm frame with a 90mm stem, which felt comfortable if a tiny bit stretched. If I was going to buy this bike \u2013 can we pause here for a moment while I idly dream of this happening \u2013 I might go for the next size down, the 55cm, but it\u2019s marginal. Rose don\u2019t have the snob pedigree of Canyon, let alone of the more venerable marques, but they are known for astonishing value, as well as a website that lets you create a bespoke bike from a list of options, built for you at their cavernous facility near the German-Dutch border.  On to the high-tech frame, itself weighing less than a kilo, is bolted a range of shiny kit: aside from the Dura-Ace components you get about \u00a3400 of DT Swiss wheels, the same Continental tyres as the Canyon, even about \u00a3175 of bling carbon fibre \u201cmonolink\u201d seatpost and saddle. Buy a bike with this sort of kit from a high street bike chain and you\u2019ll generally be thinking above \u00a33,000. My main try-out for this ultra-light machine was 102 hilly miles of a sportive around Surrey, which was, thanks to the Rose, the most astonishing fun. Compared with the Canyon, the Rose is designed more for speed, and that\u2019s just what you get. For all sorts of legal reasons, sportives are not officially races, but organisers often classify rider\u2019 times into gold, silver or bronze, depending how fast you finish. The Rose led me to my first-ever gold time, which is not a coincidence. That a 6.3kg bike is nippy up hills won\u2019t come as a shock, but it\u2019s also hugely assured and intuitive, and still pretty comfortable. If Rose UK hadn\u2019t needed it back very quickly I\u2019d still be riding it now. Planet X RT-90 Comp - \u00a31,599.99     Planet X RT-90 Comp. Photograph: Planet X    My plan had been to try out one of the Sheffield company\u2019s venerable Pro Carbon machines, but the company\u2019s founder, Dave Loughran, unexpectedly hijacked the email exchange with his press officer to insist I ride their latest, flashy offering. I tried hard to argue against him ... well, actually I said yes straight away. Loughran\u2019s evident keenness to show off his new creation seems typical of Planet X, very much a firm run by, and for, excitable enthusiasts. The RT-90 is a cut above the \u00a31,000 bike to work scheme specials on which Planet X made their name. It is avowedly race-based. In fact, the \u00a32,000 model is the bike raced by two domestic teams kitted out by the firm. Using Planet X\u2019s website guide, I plumped for a medium frame with a 90mm stem, and it was pretty much a perfect fit. While the Comp usually comes in a somewhat muted black and green look, as pictured above, mine had the same dayglo yellow look of the team model (and slightly different wheels). Wherever I rode, it seemed, I was a beacon, both metaphorically and literally, for would-be overtakers. Being inconspicuous was not an option. Just as well, then, that the RT-90 is expressly designed to scoot you along as fast as you can possibly manage. The frame is stiff and responsive to grin-inducing levels. It might not actually make you a stronger rider, but it has a near-magical ability to hypnotise you into believing you are. On a hilly 60-mile ride through south-east London and into Kent I somehow kept up with a friend who usually a fair bit quicker. As we weaved through the backmarkers of a sportive using the same roads, sprinting up the short climbs, it was about as much fun as you can have on a road bike. As a race machine, the bike comes with a fairly narrow 11-25 cassette. Being more of a spinner than a grinder I feared for myself on the steeper inclines. As it turned out, even York\u2019s Hill in Kent with it\u2019s maximum 25% gradient, proved possible. Like the other two test machines the RT-90 is exceptionally well kitted out, this time with a Sram Force groupset, officially costing a good \u00a3700 on its own.

Plans to ramp up the US military presence in the area would probably involve flying over and sailing close to artificial islands that were only reefs before the latest building project, and China last week issued multiple warnings to a US plane flying above Fiery Cross reef, where China has built an early-warning radar station and airstrip. Defence ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said that the country\u2019s reclamation activities were comparable with development of homes, roads and other infrastructure on the mainland.

Americans fear that China\u2019s rapid economic growth will slowly translate into a more expansive and assertive foreign policy that will inevitably result in a war with the US. Harvard Professor Graham Allison has found: \u201cin 12 of 16 cases in the past 500 years when a rising power challenged a ruling power, the outcome was war.\u201d Chicago University scholar John Mearsheimer has bluntly argued: \u201cChina cannot rise peacefully.\u201d But the apparently looming conflict between the US and China is not because of China\u2019s rise per se, but rather because the US insists on maintaining military and economic dominance among China\u2019s neighbors. Although Americans like to think of their massive overseas military presence as a benign force that\u2019s inherently stabilizing, Beijing certainly doesn\u2019t see it that way. According to political scientists  Andrew Nathan and Andrew Scobell, Beijing sees America as \u201cthe most intrusive outside actor in China\u2019s internal affairs, the guarantor of the status quo in Taiwan, the largest naval presence in the East China and South China seas, [and] the formal or informal military ally of many of China\u2019s neighbors.\u201d (All of which is true.) They think that the US \u201cseeks to curtail China\u2019s political influence and harm China\u2019s interests\u201d with a \u201cmilitaristic, offense-minded, expansionist, and selfish\u201d foreign policy. China\u2019s regional ambitions are not uniquely pernicious or aggressive, but they do overlap with America\u2019s ambition to be the dominant power in its own region, and in every region of the world.  Leaving aside caricatured debates about which nation should get to wave the big \u201cNumber 1\u201d foam finger, it\u2019s worth asking whether having 50,000 US troops permanently stationed in Japan actually serves US interests and what benefits we derive from keeping almost 30,000 US troops in South Korea and whether Americans will be any safer if the Obama administration manages to reestablish a US military presence in the Philippines to counter China\u2019s maritime territorial claims in the South China Sea. Many commentators say yes. Robert Kagan  argues not only that US hegemony makes us safer and richer, but also that it bestows peace and prosperity on everybody else. If America doesn\u2019t rule, goes his argument, the world becomes less free, less stable and less safe. But a good chunk of the scholarly literature disputes these claims. \u201cThere are good theoretical and empirical reasons\u201d, wrote political scientist Christopher Fettweis in his book Pathologies of Power, \u201cto doubt that US hegemony is the primary cause of the current stability.\u201d The international system, rather than cowering in obedience to American demands for peace, is far more \u201cself-policing\u201d, says Fettweis. A combination of economic development and the destructive power of modern militaries serves as a much more satisfying answer for why states increasingly see war as detrimental to their interests.  International relations theorist Robert Jervis has  written that \u201cthe pursuit of primacy was what great power politics was all about in the past\u201d but that, in a world of nuclear weapons with \u201clow security threats and great common interests among the developed countries\u201d, primacy does not have the strategic or economic benefits it once had. Nor does US dominance reap much in the way of tangible rewards for most Americans: international relations theorist Daniel Drezner  contends that \u201cthe economic benefits from military predominance alone seem, at a minimum, to have been exaggerated\u201d; that \u201cThere is little evidence that military primacy yields appreciable geoeconomic gains\u201d; and that, therefore, \u201can overreliance on military preponderance is badly misguided.\u201d The struggle for military and economic primacy in Asia is not really about our core national security interests; rather, it\u2019s about preserving status, prestige and America\u2019s neurotic image of itself. Those are pretty dumb reasons to risk war. There are a host of reasons why the dire predictions of a coming US-China conflict may be wrong, of course. Maybe China\u2019s economy will slow or even suffer crashes. Even if it continues to grow, the US\u2019s economic and military advantage may remain intact for a few more decades, making China\u2019s rise gradual and thus less dangerous.  Moreover, both countries are armed with nuclear weapons. And there\u2019s little reason to think the mutually assured destruction paradigm that characterized the Cold War between the US and the USSR wouldn\u2019t dominate this shift in power as well.  But why take the risk, when maintaining US primacy just isn\u2019t that important to the safety or prosperity of Americans?

Related: South China Sea islands are Chinese plan to militarise zone, claims US    The Chinese are dredging the sea bed to transform a few reefs and rocks in the Spratly group of islands and atolls \u2013 which they claim \u2013 into man-made islands with a runway that can support military flights. This has caused great concern among their neighbours. The Chinese government rejects international criticisms, asserts its sovereign right to build on the islands, and demands that American naval surveillance aircraft overflying the new islands leave the Chinese air control zone immediately. There are also reports that China has begun to put heavy weapons on one of them. While one of the new islands looks like an unsinkable aircraft carrier in the making, it is unlikely to be built to project Chinese air power. In the age of long-range missiles and precision weapons, immovable aircraft carriers are easy targets. What really motivates the Chinese government is something more strategic. By transforming rocks into islands, the Chinese government is creating a reality on the ground in asserting its sovereignty over these disputed rocks and laying the ground to claim the territorial waters around them. The Chinese statement that they will eventually allow others to use facilities on the islands for disaster relief or rescue operations is significant. To take advantage of them, users will no doubt need to acknowledge Chinese sovereignty. The fact that the United Nations convention on the law of the sea is clear on what constitutes an island with territorial water \u2013 which should exclude such man-made structures \u2013 is not deemed an insurmountable obstacle in China. The ruling Communist party has never allowed the law to restrict what it can do. Even in the international community it has a record of successfully imposing its will on other states, notwithstanding the norm. The classic case is Taiwan\u2019s international status. Taiwan has a permanent population, a defined territory, a democratically elected government and the capacity to enter into relations with other states, and thus meets all the criteria for statehood under the Montevideo Convention of 1934. It has also never come under the jurisdiction of the People\u2019s Republic of China. But the Chinese government lays claim to Taiwan and insists on other states not violating its \u201cone China principle\u201d. By dogged insistence and skilful use of leverage, it has successfully persuaded most nations not to challenge its assertion that Taiwan is not a country but a \u201crenegade province of China\u201d. It has reason to believe it can achieve the same with the Spratly islands. This is exactly why Vietnam and the Philippines, which also claim the same islets, are deeply concerned. Most other states in east Asia also find the Chinese move discomfiting. It is the apparent casualness with which China asserts its claims regardless of other conflicting claims that is disconcerting. What will China do next? In its rush to secure this crucial waterway for Chinese shipping, Beijing is seeking to strengthen its efforts to build a new \u201cmaritime silk road\u201d through the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean to east Africa and the Mediterranean. But it is counter-productive. For the maritime silk road idea to succeed, it must be embraced by China\u2019s maritime neighbours. They need to feel reassured that the Chinese are not aggressive. The island-building delivers the opposite effect. Maritime powers with no involvement in the disputes, such as the US and Australia, are also concerned as the Chinese move is a big step forward to laying claim to territorial waters around these man-made islands. If China should successfully claim all of the Spratly islands, it would transform most of the South China Sea, one of the most important maritime routes in the world, into a \u201cChinese lake\u201d. The US has sent a naval aircraft and may dispatch ships close to the new islands to demonstrate that it does not acknowledge that any change of status under international law has taken place. It needs to do so to protect the freedom of navigation, but it is a dangerous game that is being played \u2013 by both sides.

The Chinese dredger barges can reach up to 30 metres below the surface, cutting out and scooping up huge quantities of sand and coral for land reclamation projects. The technology is sophisticated, but the idea is simple: debris is collected from the seabed and piled up until it creates an island.   Related: China cares little for other countries\u2019 territorial claims    Sometimes the slurry is pumped straight from the boats in heavy plumes, landing between barriers marking off what will become solid ground. If the areas being dredged and reclaimed are too far apart, it is loaded on to smaller boats that ferry it over before dumping it in place. Decades old, the technology has been used around the world to build projects ranging from Hong Kong\u2019s main airport and entire districts of Singapore to the ostentatious villa settlements on Dubai\u2019s Palm Islands \u2013 man-made islands which form the shape of a tree. But what was once largely a practical concern of urban planners and developers has been thrust into the international spotlight by Beijing\u2019s decision to use the technology to consolidate its presence on a string of islands in the South China Sea. In barely two years, more than 2,000 acres, an area more than twice the size of New York\u2019s Central Park, has been carved from what were open stretches of the South China Sea.       The area is a busy shipping route connecting to the Strait of Malacca and the Pacific and is believed to have rich oil and gas deposits, meaning that the tiny specks of land that dot it have been contested by many neighbouring powers for decades. Some countries, including Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan, have used land reclamation to expand or plan expansion of the islands so that they can better support human life and, by extension, troops and other military capacity. However, China is the only power to have begun turning reefs, which are under water at high tide and therefore not considered land under international law, into permanent islands. This weekend Beijing\u2019s conversion of open ocean it claims as its own into land that could be used to claim even more ocean triggered a serious escalation in the long-running dispute. US defence secretary Ashton Carter yesterday demanded an \u201cimmediate and lasting halt\u201d to the reclamation projects after stepping up surveillance flights and a naval presence around the new islands. His demand has been supported by other regional powers alarmed at the speed of the developments. \u201cChina has reclaimed over 2,000 acres, more than all other claimants combined, and more than in the entire history of the region. And China did so in only the last 18 months,\u201d Carter told the Shangri-La regional dialogue in Singapore. \u201cIt is unclear how much farther China will go. That is why this stretch of water has become the source of tension in the region and front-page news around the world.\u201d China\u2019s breakneck pace of island construction is partly a result of technological improvements. The country has become a world leader in land reclamation, creating more than 10,000 square kilometres along its coastline, but managing projects on a remote ocean outcrop is much harder than pushing out the shoreline by a few hundred kilometres near home.     A US navy crewman aboard a surveillance aircraft views a computer screen purportedly showing Chinese construction on the reclaimed land of Fiery Cross Reef. Photograph: Reuters    \u201cTechnical constraints were a factor in the past for the reclamation of islands. The islands were too far away from the mainland for any construction work to be carried out,\u201d said Du Xiaojun, researcher at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies. Reefs are ideal locations for land reclamation because they rise far above the surrounding seabed, making them accessible to dredger barges. Recently released photos show more than 30 such ships clustered around one of the new islands, explaining the dramatic speed of the expansion. One ship working in the South China Sea, tracked by Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly, can suck up 4,500 cubic metres of debris an hour from the seabed. It has recently been at work on perhaps the most controversial aspect of the disputed expansion, runway construction. One of the peculiarities of Beijing\u2019s longstanding claim over the two South China Sea island chains, the Paracels and the Spratlys, is that they lie so far from the country that it has been effectively impossible for the Chinese military to patrol the area from its existing bases hundreds of nautical miles away. But tarmac is already being laid on Fiery Cross Reef for an airstrip which is potentially long enough to support most military and surveillance planes. Even more disturbingly for China\u2019s regional rivals, the airstrip may be intended as part of a wider web of bases and supply stations. Plans on the website of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation laid out details of an airstrip complex at the Johnson South Reef, with a CGI image of the outpost containing windmills for power and greenhouses for food, although they have been taken down. Beijing insists that the reclamation projects are part of an effort to support civilians and shipping in an area which has both heavy traffic and difficult weather and has brushed off reports that recent US satellite photos showed two artillery vehicles on one.    It\u2019s obviously unfair for the west to question China\u2019s intentions in its reclamation projects  Xu Liping, researcher at the Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies     \u201cThe Nansha [Spratly] Islands is in a distant sea area with busy shipping routes and vulnerable to marine perils,\u201d Ouyang Yujing, head of the foreign ministry\u2019s department of boundary and ocean affairs told the official Xinhua news agency. He listed China\u2019s responsibilities for \u201cmaritime search and rescue, disaster prevention and mitigation, marine scientific research, meteorological observation, ecological environment preservation, safety of navigation and fishery production\u201d. Objections to the plan are born of fear and discrimination, say officials and analysts in China. They argue that other nations\u2019 projects to boost their claims on disputed outposts, from expansion to sponsoring civilian communities, have gone largely unchallenged. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously unfair for the west to question China\u2019s intentions in its reclamation projects. It shows that the west has wilfully misjudged the situation in the South China Sea,\u201d said Xu Liping, researcher at the Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies inside the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a leading government thinktank. However, no other power has created dry land from stretches of open sea and, whatever their current use, Beijing\u2019s top generals and politicians are well aware of the islands\u2019 vital strategic importance to a country that is aiming to project its naval power ever further from its shores. The various outcrops claimed by China cover just 13 square kilometres in total, but are key to controlling 2m square kilometres of sea and critical routes to the Pacific, according to a recent US state department assessment of Beijing\u2019s claims. Analysts, including Xu, describe them as one of China\u2019s \u201ccore interests\u201d, and the government has flirted with officially giving the area that status, which would put it on a par with areas such as Tibet and Taiwan, and therefore be seen as critical to national sovereignty and a possible trigger of military action.     An uneasy relationship: US secretary of state John Kerry (left) and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi shake hands after a meeting in Beijing in May to discuss the South China Sea issue. Photograph: Ng Han Guan/AP    That hardline view may have been behind a recent editorial in the Global Times, a fiercely nationalist government-controlled paper which warned that war was inevitable if the US tried to stop the reclamation projects. Beijing has since said that the paper speaks only for itself and that the government is focused on maintaining peace and stability in the area, but there is little question that the tabloid\u2019s stance has been embraced by some hardliners within the Chinese military and government. \u201cThe Global Times\u2019 editorial has expressed a certain view,\u201d Xu said. \u201cChina is determined to defend its sovereignty in the South China Sea and others should not test its bottom line or challenge its core interests.\u201d Beijing\u2019s arguments have the weight of decades of history. The current claims were first expressed in recognisable form on a government map created several years before the communists swept to power in 1949, according to a US state department report . However, they are somewhat vague, defined by a \u201cnine-dash line\u201d, drawn on maps without detailed coordinates and never officially submitted to an international body. The lines often sit closer to the coast of nearby countries than to the nearest island on which China is anchoring its claim. Washington has always said that it takes no position on the sovereignty dispute, but objects to the islands because China is using the tiny new territories to take control of surrounding air and water, with a string of military warnings to stay away from one island recently captured on film by CNN. \u201cTurning an underwater rock into an airfield simply does not afford the rights of sovereignty or permit restrictions on international air or maritime transit,\u201d said Carter, warning that China may find decades of dusty agreements far harder to transform than the sea itself.

Familiar names such as Jo Brand, Al Murray and Phil Jupitus can be found in the comedy programme, which dominates the festival by making up 34% of the shows, but festival organisers said climate change, gender and sexuality, and father and child relationships had emerged as key themes from the shows on offer.

Elsewhere, the search for new venues has taken shows to the Clifton Hall public school, while a 15th century countryside church at Crichton will host medieval plainsong. Kath Mainland, chief executive of the fringe, admitted she was increasingly reluctant to focus on the event\u2019s routinely record-setting statistics each year as they detracted from the event\u2019s diversity, creativity and art.  But the 50,459 events scheduled for the festival\u2019s 25-day run \u2013 a 3.8% increase on last year \u2013 underlined the event\u2019s strength and vitality.  Broadly speaking, the fringe has doubled in size every decade since it began nearly 70 years ago, said Mainland. \u201cIt shows that it flourishes, it is in good health \u2026 it\u2019s a great place to show your work to a live, risk-taking audience, without waiting for an invitation.\u201d   Related: Edinburgh fringe 2015 lineup: grab your chance to see theatre's future    The official launch of the full fringe programme on Thursday put tickets on sale for a final batch of 600 shows, largely by smaller companies, whose performances had not yet become public.  The expansion of the fringe has significantly increased competition between production companies, and increased pressure for ticket sales to be opened far earlier in the year, to allow visitors to plan Edinburgh visits well in advance.  Mainland confirmed that the year on year expansion of the programme raised challenges for the Fringe to ensure audiences could navigate the 450-page long programme comfortably.  \u201cThe thing which is brilliant about the fringe is the element of discovery, the fact that you don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it, and it\u2019s our job to make that as undaunting as possible for an audience,\u201d she said. It also raised constant challenges for the city and the fringe to find new venues. Asked whether there was a physical capacity limit for the relatively small city, Mainland said: \u201cI guess logic would tell you that there must be, but experience would tell you that there isn\u2019t.\u201d  But she added: \u201c[I] think actually that venue landscape also appeals to the audience and is special about the fringe \u2026 venues just permeate through the whole city. The venues are sometimes as exciting as discovering the shows.\u201d After a controversy last year when two Israeli-government funded shows were cancelled after pro-Palestinian protests and artist-led demands for a cultural boycott, Mainland insisted that the fringe was completely open to all. \u201cWe\u2019re an open access festival where anybody who wants to come with a show can come,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s our job to do more to make sure that anybody who wants to perform here can, but we\u2019ve to be aware of the physical constraints and the decision they took last year was not taken lightly.\u201d "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/05/vietnam-message-china-fighter-jets-drones-south-china-sea", "publicationDate": "2015-06-05T09:18:56Z", "tags": ["Vietnam", "China", "Australia news", "Malaysia", "Brunei", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Philippines", "Drones (military)"], "sentences": ["Several countries claim islands and surrounding waters in the South China Sea, including Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, Taiwan and the Philippines."], "title": "Vietnam upgrade air defences South China Sea dispute", "article": "Vietnam is seeking to upgrade its air defences by acquiring western fighter jets and drones, a move which would further militarise a dispute with Beijing over territorial claims in the South China Sea.

Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in the 6-3 case, which ruled in favor of the US government and against the family of Menachem Zivotofsky, who sued to get the boy\u2019s birthplace listed as \u201cJerusalem, Israel\u201d. The US has declined to recognize the sovereignty of any country over Jerusalem since 1948. In 2002, Congress passed a law that instructed the State Department, which handles passports, to list Israel should a US citizen request it. \u201cTo allow Congress to control the president\u2019s communication in the context of a formal recognition determination is to allow Congress to exercise that exclusive power itself,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cAs a result, the statute is unconstitutional.\u201d  Chief justice John Roberts, Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito dissented. Clarence Thomas concurred only with regard to passports as a presidential power, and dissented on the remainder of the decision. Citing historical precedents \u2013 colonial revolts in South America, revolutions in Texas and Russia \u2013 and the president\u2019s many powers in foreign policy, including naming ambassadors and brokering treaties, Kennedy wrote that the president held exclusive power to recognize sovereignty, including through passports. \u201cCongress, by contrast, has no constitutional power that would enable it to initiate diplomatic relations with a foreign nation,\u201d he wrote, adding: \u201cPut simply, the nation must have a single policy regarding which governments are legitimate in the eyes of the United States and which are not.\u201d Kennedy said Congress retains ways to to regulate the president\u2019s powers, such as approving ambassadors and apportioning funds, but framed the decision as a victory for separation of powers. \u201cIn a world that is ever more compressed and interdependent, it is essential the congressional role in foreign affairs be understood and respected,\u201d he wrote.  Passports should be considered formal recognitions, the court ruled, and as a means of the president\u2019s communication with foreign states. By passing the 2002 law, Kennedy said: \u201cCongress wanted to express its displeasure with the president\u2019s policy by, among other things, commanding the executive to contradict his own, earlier stated position on Jerusalem.\u201d President George W Bush signed the 2002 bill into law but also objected, writing that it could \u201cimpermissibly interfere with the president\u2019s constitutional authority\u201d. In his dissent, Roberts complained of \u201cthe stark nature of the court\u2019s error on a basic question of separation of powers\u201d. The executive and legislative branches share powers of foreign policy, he argued.

Scalia argued that the president could always issue a statement to dispel any doubt over US policy toward Jerusalem, and noted the contrast in US policy toward China and Taiwan, which is similarly disputed but which can be listed on US passports. The State Department refused the Zivotofskys\u2019 initial request to designate Israel on their son\u2019s passport. In 2013, the supreme court ruled that the family could sue. The Washington DC appeals court ruled in the government\u2019s favor. Last year, the case returned to the supreme court. US solicitor general Don Verrilli reminded the justices of decades of consistent foreign policy with regard to Jerusalem, and argued that the law undermined the president\u2019s ability to mediate peace talks in the Middle East.  \u201cPassport power\u201d resides with the State Department, attorney Alyza Lewin argued in return, meaning that Congress had not encroached on any presidential authority.  The ability to request Israel on the passport was \u201ccreated to give individuals the right to self-identify\u201d, Lewin said.

The Kadazan Dusun people believe Mt Kinabalu is a sacred place \u2013 its name can be roughly interpreted as meaning \u201cthe revered place of the dead\u201d.  Travellers are repeatedly urged in guides and signage to show respect for the spiritual significance of the Unesco World Heritage site.

Four of the tourists are currently in custody. But what are they actually charged with?     Briton Eleanor Hawkins. Photograph: Family handout/PA    What did the initial reports say? The first indication that Malaysians blamed foreigners taking naked pictures on the country\u2019s highest peak for the deadly earthquake came after news agency reports of comments on social media, where images of the tourists were being circulated. The anger escalated after a press conference called by Sri Joseph Pairin Kitingan, the deputy chief minister and a key Kadazan Dusun figure. In comments reported by the Malay Mail and elsewhere, Pairin said the tourists should be taken to a local court and charged according to local customs. \u201cWhether other people believe this or not, it\u2019s what we Sabahans believe. When the earthquake happened, it\u2019s like a confirmation of our beliefs. It is a sacred mountain and you cannot take it lightly. \u201cThere is almost certainly a connection. We have to take this as a reminder that local beliefs and customs are not to be disrespected.\u201d Many locals have agreed with Pairin. Fendi Adam, a teenager member of the Dusun tribe, told the Guardian: \u201cIt was the first earthquake we had that we felt here in Kota Kinabalu. \u201cThe spirits don\u2019t like what they did. They should be kept in jail for a long time.\u201d Sabah\u2019s chief tribal priest, Tindarama Aman Sirom Simbuna, told Malaysia\u2019s Star newspaper that the tourists should be fined 10 head of buffalo in line with local customs. It quoted him saying: \u201cAccording to local beliefs, the spirit of the mountain is very angry,\u201d he said. \u201cThis fine, called sogit in the native tongue, should be in the form of 10 male or female buffaloes.\u201d Were the foreigners actually arrested for causing the earthquake? No. Although there have been calls to try the tourists in local courts and according to tribal laws, that is not what has happened.  The four who have been arrested in Malaysia will face charges under the national penal code, and the alleged offences do not have any connection to the earthquake. Hawkins\u2019 lawyer, Ronny Cham, said \u201ccausing annoyance by conducting obscene acts in a public place\u201d is the likely charge. Masidi Manjun, Sabah state tourism minister, said Malaysians \u201cespecially those in Sabah were very upset\u201d at some tabloid reports suggesting the tourists were arrested for angering the mountain gods and for causing the earthquake. \u201cThey were remanded for four days for further investigation for alleged offence or offences under the penal code. Definitely they were not arrested for causing a \u2018deadly earthquake\u2019,\u201d Masidi said. \u201cWe never said the naked stunt caused the earthquake. Sabahans were \u2018boiling hot\u2019 for their total disrespect of Mt Kinabalu, considered sacred by Sabah\u2019s largest indigenous tribe, even before the earthquake happened. The earthquake multiplies their anger 1,000 times.\u201d     People light candles in memory of the earthquake victims in Kota Kinabalu on June 7 Photograph: Xinhua/Landov/Barcroft Media    Were the \u2018earthquake\u2019 claims even started by Malaysians? Masidi has claimed the rumour that the nude pictures caused the earthquake was started initially not by Malaysians, but by the alleged ringleader of the stripping travellers, a Canadian called Emil Kaminski. The self-described \u201cperpetual backpacker\u201d was the first to post the naked picture on Mt Kinabalu, and has subsequently posted multiple times on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube about the incident.  Kaminski, who Hawkins\u2019 father called a \u201chalfwit\u201d, has a Facebook page with a number of nude pictures taken at altitude, most of which appear to be in his home country of Canada. It does not, however, appear to be the case that Kaminski was the first to connect his nudity with the earthquake.  The first reference Kaminski makes to the affair is on his Facebook page, where he links to reports of deputy chief minister Pairin\u2019s comments about the earthquake.  \u201cSome deranged prick has linked earthquakes and mountaintop nudity,\u201d he wrote.  \u201cWell, apparently I am responsible for the 2015 Nepal quake, and whatever incoming quakes in Canada (as well as Thailand, India, China, Taiwan, Hongkong, and a variety of other countries)...\u201d His later postings include a video called Trolling Malaysia which sees him continue to mock the outrage. \u201cJesus Christ people, it\u2019s just a fucking mountain,\u201d he says.

Those skills were said to include the power to predict people\u2019s futures and to cure incurable ailments.

Primark has acquired the leases for seven stores in the US and plans to open them by the end of 2016, while Topshop opened a store in Manhattan in 2009 and also has outlets in Houston and Atlanta. After launching in the US in 1996, Ted Baker now has 52 shops and concessions there. The UK remains Ted Baker\u2019s biggest market, but a strong US performance was singled out by the company as it reported a 24% rise in turnover between February and June. Retail sales over the 18-week period grew 18.9%, as Ted Baker capitalised on increased demand across the business by adding more store space. Internet sales had also risen sharply and that it expected to meet its financial targets for the year. The company\u2019s founder and chief executive, Ray Kelvin, said the company was pleased with sales of its spring/summer collections. The revenue boost came despite trading at the more expensive end of the British high street, where it faces stiff competition from rivals like Primark who cater for more cost-conscious shoppers. The four month period saw the company open new stores in Hong Kong and London as well as a number of concessions across Europe, North America and Asia.   Ted Baker said the US performance was helped by big orders from US wholesalers. Jonathan De Mello, an analyst at Harper Dennis Hobbs, a retail advisory firm, said brands like Ted Baker and Karen Millen were enjoying a surge of success in the US at present. They, alongside brands like Karen Millen and others, have this British design quality which is ringing quite true across the US,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the US a lot of the American retailers have basically the same brands. Just like we are in the UK, we have all the same brands in the different shopping centres and when a US brand comes here like a JCrew or an American Eagle or something like that, it is quite exciting new and different and they can do really well. And it is the same in reverse in the US where all these mall owners like General Growth and Simon Properties and others, they are always looking to refresh their tenant mixes. De Mello added: \u201cI think they [Ted Baker] are scratching the surface at the moment. I think they will open a lot more in the US as others have done successfully. They are part of a wave of European retailers who are targeting the US and expanding quickly in the US.\u201d Data from market research firm Euromonitor has shown that while US consumers typically spend less on clothes, they buy twice the number of items. Ted Baker said it has also expanded with new stores in Azerbaijan, Dubai, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Taiwan. Revenue growth for the full year is expected at 18%, with interim results to be announced in October. The group trades from 414 stores and concessions globally having grown from a single shirt specialist store in Glasgow. The majority of its stores are in the UK and mainland Europe. In March, the firm posted a 24% rise in annual profit, with revenue double that reported five years ago. \u201cWe are pleased with the performance of our spring/summer collections both in the UK and internationally, which is testament to our skilled and passionate team,\u201d Kelvin said. Analysts Liberium said the start of the year for the retailer had been \u201cexceptionally strong\u201d while retail commentator Nick Bubb said the success lay in giving the brand a \u201cquirky personality\u201d between the luxury and mid-level clothing markets.

Graham-Harrison fails to mention that China has claimed the disputed islands as Chinese territory since the 12th century, when Chinese texts record these islands as part of China. We should take note also that the US has numerous military bases in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Taiwan and that a number of Pacific islands host nuclear warships, nuclear missiles and B-1 bombers. America\u2019s seventh fleet \u2013 with more than 70 warships plus aircraft carriers with hundreds of fighter planes \u2013 continuously patrols the East and South China seas. In addition, it is well known that President Obama\u2019s Asia Pivot policy announced in 2011 in his speech in Australia\u2019s parliament is intended to strangle China militarily, while America\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership is intended to strangle it economically. It was the US who initiated these moves years before China\u2019s military buildup. Considering these facts, China\u2019s military installations in the South China Sea islands are clearly a reaction to America\u2019s overt military threats.Bill MathewMelbourne, Australia \u2022 That hardline warning in the Chinese press that \u201cwar [is] inevitable if the US [tries] to stop the reclamation projects\u201d in the South China Sea is the kind of thing that is once again making us nervous down here in our antipodean isolation from Europe and America. But it may be that our fear of Chinese military aggression \u2013 a fear that has a lot to do with our experience fighting off the Japanese in the 1940s \u2013 is focused in the wrong place.  A 1938 book in my late father\u2019s library had an interesting thing to say about the tension between nations in our region at a time when we were experiencing growing nervousness at the rise of an aggressive Japan. It\u2019s a message that may well be applicable to our current fear of an aggressive, expansionist, China. That book, Japan Reaches Out by Willard Price, stressed that \u201cnational supremacy is in the last analysis a matter of economics, not guns. If the Japanese can make better mouse traps than the rest of us\u201d, wrote Price, \u201cguns will not stop them conquering the earth\u201d. In the end, in the particular circumstances of that time, the Japanese did use military force \u2013 and lots of it. And it was guns that stopped them. But in the far less aggressive circumstances of today, Price\u2019s notion could still hold true. Nearly everything we buy down under, so it seems, is made in China. And we are still heavily dependent for our export wealth on the China market. If push came to shove in Sino-Australian relations, they would have us over a barrel economically, notwithstanding our strong US military alliance. They wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to use their guns.Terry HewtonAdelaide, South Australia Problem with referendums The problem with referendums is not \u201cthat they can go horribly wrong\u201d (Cameron should beware the referendum, 5 June). They go wrong when the process is abused by political leaders. Switzerland provides the evidence that when the referendum process is under citizen control it is efficient and effective. The Swiss typically vote on 12 to 14 national referendums every year. These referendums are not initiated by the Swiss government. Some are required by their constitution; most are petitioned by citizens. The Swiss referendum process keeps politicians on their toes. They know that a vote is likely to be petitioned where parliament fails to act. Citizens are aware of the referendum option should politicians fail to respond to public demands. They also know, however, that it is citizens, not the government, who will have to live with the consequences. The country\u2019s political and economic stability is due to the responsibility the Swiss constitution assigns to citizens for their own governance.Andr\u00e9 CarrelTerrace, British Columbia, Canada Australia\u2019s asylum failure The assertion that \u201cAustralia has successfully stopped its boat-people problem by the simple expedient of rescuing them, if necessary, and then returning them to their point of origin\u201d is a staggering misstatement (Reply, 29 May). How wide it is of the truth can be seen in the report of the commonwealth and immigration ombudsman, which slams the Australian government for its prolonged detention of asylum seekers after finding children are being born and remain in detention facilities waiting for their families\u2019 claims of protection to be processed. The ombudsman noted the government\u2019s duty of care to detainees, and the damage done to their physical and mental wellbeing. The director of the International Detention Coalition said Australia had one of the longest immigration detention rates in the world. So much for the benign policies with which the Australian government is credited. Malcolm RonanMelbourne, Australia Give Canada a break It\u2019s time the eco-world took a reality check and eased up on Canada bashing (Oil still king in Canada\u2019s west, 15 May). It\u2019s true that we are top of the league in per-capita production of CO2, but given our climate and population distribution, is that really so surprising? Moreover, much of that CO2 comes from the production of food and natural resources that are eagerly used by the rest of the world, who hypocritically assign the CO2 content to us rather than to them. Our CO2 production is minuscule compared with that from the \u201cdirty five\u201d of China, the US, Russia, the EU and Japan; if we stopped all Canadian CO2 emissions tomorrow, the resulting change in the atmospheric CO2 content would be less than the analytical error involved in its measurement. We\u2019re all in favour of CO2 reduction, but achieving that aim itself will take energy derived partly from hydrocarbons. Wouldn\u2019t you rather that the energy came from responsible producers in Canada than from the Middle East cauldron?A MitchellVancouver, British Columbia, Canada Uzbekistan\u2019s rights abuses Your article Fear still grips Uzbek refugees (29 May) makes no reference to the international response to the massacre.

Murray takes on Fernando Verdasco in the second round of the Aegon Championships, a man he has beaten 10 times out of 11 but who almost ruined Murray\u2019s march to the Wimbledon title two years ago when he led by two sets to love.

His form over the past few months suggests he should be able to handle Verdasco and he sharpened up by playing doubles with Dominic Inglot against the No1 seeds here, Bruno Soares and Alexander Peya. Their 6-4, 7-6 defeat will not have pleased either man but for Murray it was useful match practice and he should be sharper for it on Thursday. For Inglot, it was a first match in more than two months after a knee injury and a chance to put himself back in the mix for Britain\u2019s Davis Cup quarter-final against France, back here at Queen\u2019s the week after Wimbledon. Having played in the win over the USA, alongside Jamie Murray, Inglot said the Davis Cup was his main goal, a brave statement considering Wimbledon is just around the corner. Britain\u2019s captain, Leon Smith, was keen for Murray and Inglot to play together here and the big-serving Englishman knows that a good performance at Wimbledon could put him back in pole position. \u201cI think that position for the Davis Cup is really up for grabs,\u201d he said, acknowledging that Colin Fleming and Jonny Marray are also in the hunt. \u201cBecause anybody can step up and if they have a good tournament it\u2019s going to be tough for Leon to say: \u2018Well, I can\u2019t rule that guy out.\u2019\u201d Nine of the 16 wildcards into the main draw of Wimbledon were announced on Wednesday, with few surprises.

As Scotland is technically a regional parliament, rather than an independent nation in its own right, we perhaps have to look at this with a little more nuance.  The closest parallel is Germany, where there are several states that allow 16-year-olds to vote in their state election, including Brandenburg, Bremen and Hamburg. This is also true in the Swiss canton of Glarus, parts of Norway and, perhaps more relevantly, in the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey (all semi-autonomous UK territories). Italians have to wait till they are 25 to vote in senate elections, which is also the minimum voting age in the United Arab Emirates (where emirates select certain people in the electorate to vote, rather than extending the right to vote to everyone).  There is only one state in the world with a maximum voting age for its national election \u2013 the Vatican City, where only cardinals aged under 80 are allowed to cast a vote in papal elections.

On Palawan island, locals joke there might still be some hiding, waiting for the world to move on while unaware of the the fact that it has.

The Philippine defence secretary, Voltaire Gazmin, said this week that Japan should become further involved with Manila\u2019s military, arguing for a visiting forces agreement which would allow Japanese troops to be stationed in the Philippines, similar to a deal with Washington, which has naval ships in Filipino ports. \u201cIt would be ironic if we cannot do exercises with Japanese forces when Japan is one of the only two countries \u2013 the other one being the United States \u2013 which are strategic partners of the Philippines,\u201d Gazmin said on Wednesday.

After its defeat, Japan\u2019s 1947 constitution \u2014 which was largely written by US occupation officials \u2014 forbade the formation of a traditional military force. The country has a self defence force which is restricted to protecting the mainland. This has been used only when conflicts abroad are considered a potential threat at home and Japan has deployed troops to Afghanistan and Iraq. The push to restart its military after so many years of pacifism is down to one man: Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who defied public opinion a year ago to overturn the country\u2019s defence policy and make it easier for troops to fight overseas. Abe and his supporters want to go even further, arguing for a more active military in the wake of China\u2019s assertiveness. China and Japan have their own dispute over the Senkakus \u2013 known in China as the Diaoyu Islands \u2013 in the East China Sea. And although Japan does not claim any islands in the South China Sea it wants to make sure the area is not controlled by Beijing. Ian Storey, from Singapore\u2019s Institute of South East Asian Studies, says roughly 85% to 90% of Japan\u2019s energy supplies come through the South China Sea which Tokyo fears could be blocked by Beijing. \u201cAny threat to the maritime trade through the South China Sea seems existential to the Japanese,\u201d he said on the phone from Singapore. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a continuation of this trend. This dispute is a long way from being resolved. Japan will continue to step up its support for the Philippines and Vietnam and maybe some other countries in south-east Asia.\u201d   Related: Vietnam upgrade air defences South China Sea dispute    Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, Taiwan also claim islands in the South China Sea, while China claims most. The naval corridor is thought to have oil and gas reserves. And Tokyo has also promised patrol boats to Vietnam, which itself is looking to pump up its military hardware to deter China. \u201cThe Japanese can honestly say this is not about the South China Sea, this about south-east Asian nations improving their maritime security. But of course, it\u2019s really about improving their capacity to be able to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Storey says. A New War of Bravado Japan\u2019s return to the South China Sea, where the carcasses of world war two ships lie in its reefs, has compounded a crisis that has led to the militarisation of all countries involved. The risk of conflict is significant. Seventy Vietnamese soldiers were killed in a 1988 naval battle with China over the Johnson South Reef. And in 2001, a Chinese F-8 fighter collided with a US Navy EP-3 reconnaissance plane. In May this year, Chinese and Vietnamese ships collided as Beijing tried to set up an oil rig.  Oil survey ships operating in Reed Bank, close to the Philippines, have increasingly been harassed by Chinese vessels and Manila is beefing up its military in the area, increasing the threat of conflict. At the forefront of this is Oyster Bay, a naturally protected cove with a deep harbour capable of hosting large warships. On the western side of Palawan, the bay\u2019s biggest selling point is that it opens directly into the South China Sea. President Benigno Aquino has called the area the \u201cfrontline of our territorial defence operations\u201d.     A Philippine fishing boat sails to Oyster Bay, the site of a proposed naval base on the edge of the South China Sea.  Photograph: Oliver Holmes for the Guardian    Philippine officials say the bay, which is protected from the monsoons by its high mountains, will be used to host the country\u2019s two large warships and act as a strategic base for the United States to rotate troops and ships, who are presently stuck on the other side of the island.  A new security pact signed during a visit by the US president, Barack Obama, last year should also allow a greater American military presence on Filipino soil, including on expanded bases. Oyster Bay is only accessible by sea but once a connecting road is complete, officials say the major work can be done.  Fishermen who live deep in a mangrove-lined inlet took the Guardian out into Ulugan Bay, which leads to Oyster Bay. They did this in small \u201cpump boats\u201d, a 15-foot canoe with two stabilising bamboo stalk, fish in the area which is full of coral reefs and protected waters. The fishermen say the navy has warned them not to approach the inlet, although several still anchor nearby to catch fish living in the cove. Two Philippine Navy patrol boats cruised in the area during the trip. Inside Oyster Bay, a concrete jetty and landing platform stretches out into the deepest waters in order for bigger ships to dock. A boathouse and a water tank are all that have been built until the road is finished and construction can begin. A snake hung from a overhanging tree and birds skimmed the calm water.     The site of a proposed Philippine naval base at Oyster Bay, Palawan Island.  Photograph: Oliver Holmes for the Guardian    Further back in the dense jungle the Guardian found a number of workmen.  Cement trucks roared down the roughly three miles of paved road, and labourers, wiping their faces with dusty t-shirts, mixed concrete while furiously pushing ahead to complete the road so Oyster Bay naval base can be built. This appears to be a race against time. A hundred miles out to sea, China is working fast, dredging thousands of tonnes of sand from the seabed to create islands.  The Philippines and its allies have been showing their strength this week, flying over the South China Sea and conducting military exercises. Many hope that is remains just a show but the militarisation of the area is a tinder box.  \u201cIf we see more Japanese aircraft and ships operating in the area,\u201d says Yoel Sano, Head of Political Risk at BMI Research, \u201cthen there will \u2013 mainly by law of numbers \u2013 be a greater likelihood of some sort of \u2018incident\u2019 or clash between them and their Chinese counterparts.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/29/greece-crisis-markets-begin-to-tumble-as-investors-flee", "publicationDate": "2015-06-29T04:56:17Z", "tags": ["Greece", "Business", "Europe", "Asia Pacific", "Currencies", "Market turmoil", "Economics", "Global economy", "Stock markets"], "sentences": ["Market benchmarks in Taiwan, Singapore and New Zealand also fell sharply."], "title": "Greece crisis: markets begin to tumble as investors flee", "article": "Markets suffered across Asia on Monday as Greece shut down its banks for a week ahead of an increasingly likely debt default.

A cash-strapped Greece looks certain to miss its debt repayment on Tuesday as Greece\u2019s European partners shut the door on extending a credit lifeline after Greece\u2019s surprise move to hold a referendum on bailout terms. Fear of an imminent default by Greece hit Greek banks, a major buyer of Greek government bills, triggering bank runs at weekend and forcing Tsipras to announce a bank holiday on Monday and capital controls. IHS Global Insight economist Rajiv Biswas said: \u201cEven if a deal is somehow reached, the ability of Greece to implement agreed reforms is doubtful.\u201d He said Greek withdrawal from the euro could lower Asian economic growth by 0.3% in 2016 due to disruption in trade and financial markets. In a brief televised address to the nation, Tsipras threw the blame onto the leaders of the eurozone. But he did not say how long the banks would remain shut, nor did he give details of how much individuals and companies would be allowed to withdraw once they reopened. All over Athens people queued at cash machines, particularly outside National Bank branches because the National Bank supplies the banknotes, and lots of other Greek banks, by midnight on Sunday, had no more of those.         Alexis Tsipras addresses the nation.     Other European banks have limited exposure to Greece.  Any speculative selling in debts of such countries as Italy, Spain and Portugal, will likely be countered by the European Central Bank, which started buying eurozone sovereign debts from markets in March to shore up the economy.

They won the team classification at last year\u2019s Tour and in Jean-Christophe P\u00e9raud and Romain Bardet, had two riders placed inside the top six on General Classification. Their all-rounder Biel Kadri, who has not made this year\u2019s team, also won a stage. With P\u00e9raud currently out of form, Bardet is likely to lead their assault on the GC this year. Unfortunately, they suffered a setback in February this year when Lloyd Mondory tested positive for EPO.

Brothers Valentin and Maxim Iglinskiy both tested positive for EPO, while three members of their Continental feeder team also fell foul of the drug testers, prompting the International Cycling Union (UCI) to recommend their World Tour licence be revoked. In April it was announced that Astana would be allowed to continue racing, as stripping them of their licence mid-season would not \u201crespect the principle of proportionality\u201d.

Team leader Tejay van Garderen is in good form and wants a podium finish, while the team boast specialists in most areas of expertise and functions superbly as a collective.

Having secured seventh place in last year\u2019s Tour courtesy of Leopold Konig, who has since moved to Sky, the team will be co-led by the German all-rounder Dominik Nerz and look likely to target assorted flat stages, where the Czech time-trialist Jan B\u00e1rta will be tasked with helping to lead out Irish Tour debutant and co-leader Sam Bennett.

Dan McLay, a 23-year-old from Leicester, turned pro with them this season after four years as an amateur in Belgium and has been touted as a potential Classics star of the future but just missed out on their roster for the Tour. While extremely unlikely to trouble the top 10 in General or Team Classification, expect this team to throw the kitchen sink and various other household items at Stage 8, which begins departs from Rennes, home of their HQ, and finishes in M\u00fbr-de-Bretagne.

While Spanish rider Daniel Navarro is their best hope of making an impact on the General Classification, Cofidis appear to have placed all their eggs in a Nacer Bouhanni-shaped basket this season and the in-form 24-year-old sprinter could very well find himself being handed a bouquet and trophy at the conclusion of at least one stage. Team leader Nacer Bouhanni (Fr) A winner of two stages and the green points jersey at the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9, the French sprinter crashed at the French national road championships last weekend putting his participation in some doubt.

Beyond that, the team will slave in the service of Manx missile Mark Cavendish, relentlessly stoking the furnace of the train from which he\u2019ll launch himself at the end of each flat stage in the hope of adding to his 25 stage victories. Team leader Mark Cavendish (United Kingdom) Came a cropper in the first stage last year and had to withdraw, rounding off a fairly miserable season by his own very high standards. Cavendish has been in spectacular form this season and, in the absence of his nemesis Marcel Kittel, looks nailed on to add to his quarter-century of Tour de France stage wins.

Both teams will fancy their chances of producing the Tour\u2019s highest-placed Frenchman, with Thibaut Pinot having finished third overall last season just behind his compatriot at AG2R, Jean-Christophe P\u00e9raud. Having lost their sprinter Nacer Bouhanni to Cofidis Solutions, FDJ\u2019s chances of success in the flat stages have been compromised and the burden of responsibility for taking on the fast men now rests on 23-year-old Arnaud D\u00e9mare. Team leader Thibaut Pinot (Fr) Third on General Classification last year and winner of the best young rider classification ahead of Romain Bardet.

Portuguese leader Rui Costa will be relying on the support of his team-mates to get him as high up the General Classification as possible, while under-achieving Italian classics rider Filippo Pozzato is riding for a new contract after two unsuccessful years, during which his manager Brent Copeland labeled him a \u201cprima donna\u201d.

The Dutch team formerly known as Belkin will be relying on Wilco Kelderman and Laurens ten Dam to keep their excitable roadside support enthused during the early stages in the Low Countries, where they\u2019ll be riding in a change strip because their usual kit is considered too \u201cyellow\u201d for a race in which that particular colour is reserved exclusively for the race leader. Team leader Wilco Kelderman (Netherlands) and Robert Gesink (Netherlands) Kelderman competes in his maiden Tour de France after two previous and highly commendable cracks at the Giro (17th and 7th) and one at the Vuelta (14th).

Ageing German sprinter Andr\u00e9 Greipel has six stage wins to his name (13 altogether in Grand Tours) and is invariably there or thereabouts in bunch finishes, while French rider Tony Gallopin took almost eight minutes out of eventual winner Vincenzo Nibali on Stage 9 of last year\u2019s Tour in a breakaway that earned him a day in yellow that he followed up with a courageous win on Stage 11. Team leader Andr\u00e9 Greipel (Ger) The German sprinter won stage six at the Giro before withdrawing ahead of a time trial and the subsequent mountain stages.

With Simon Gerrans having struggled to stay fit through a series of injuries, Michael Matthews will ride as team leader, while Gerrans and British twins Adam and Simon Yates will be hopeful of picking up other stage wins.

In Classics specialist Dan Martin and former Giro winner Ryder Hesjedal, he has a pair of lieutenants who are more than capable of picking up stage wins. The youngest team of riders on the Tour, Cannondale-Garmin will compete with a lot of public goodwill following the outpouring of sympathy that greeted the injured Talansky\u2019s heroic and ultimately successful attempt to finish stage 11 of last year\u2019s Tour just ahead of the broom wagon. Team leader Andrew Talansky (US) The New Yorker has had a decent year, winning the American national time trial championship and finishing in the top 10 of the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9, which he won in 2014.

Having had his season ruined by a virus he picked up while competing in the Tour Down Under, the thunder-thighed super-sprinter was finally showing signs of returning to race fitness, but has now been sidelined for this year\u2019s Tour, with his participation being too much of a gamble. In his absence, Giant Alpecin will expect big things from the German John Degenkolb, a winner of two classics, Milan-San Remo and Paris-Roubaix, already this year.

Two Tour de France wins later, the laughter has stopped and their methods have now been adapted by those rivals who previously found them so amusing. David Brailsford will be quietly confident of masterminding a third Tour victory for his team, with Richie Porte, Ian Stannard, Wout Poels, Leopold K\u00f6nig and Peter Kennaugh all looking in good shape to provide strong support for Chris Froome.

I really enjoy the kick you get when you solve a problem, when it\u2019s something you\u2019ve been thinking of as impossible for a long time, and it suddenly becomes obvious. That \u2018a-ha\u2019 moment \u2013 it\u2019s fun.\u201d Joe is one of six gifted young mathematicians chosen for the British team who will compete next week in the 56th International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The IMO is the world cup of mathematics competitions for secondary school-age students. It began in 1959 with seven countries competing in Bucharest, Romania. Now, it\u2019s a global event with more than 500 teenagers from over 100 countries. Like the Olympics, competitors win individual medals but also compete as a national team. The event has its own flag and even its own hymn: \u201cGathered in one desire / We are coming from everywhere / To share the joy of joining / Science and art in one / We add, we multiply / And we come to a total / Infinite is our dream / With no measure indeed / We shall meet again / Solving the problems / To think is our way / Friendship our system is.\u201d Teams from as far afield as Afghanistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Syria and Mongolia, Macau, Cuba, Cambodia and Iran will descend on Chiang Mai University for the opening ceremony on Thursday. Then on Friday morning Joe and the rest of the British team, fresh from a last-minute training camp in Malaysia, will take their seats alongside their rivals in a vast examination hall. The test lasts four and a half hours and is made up of three problems, each more difficult than the last. The next day the competitors will do the same again.     2014 film X+Y tells the story of a maths prodigy falling in love at the International Maths Olympiad    \u201cThe time flies,\u201d says Joe. \u201cYou sit there and you think. You have an idea and you try it and you work from there. There\u2019s some anxiety, but that comes mostly after you\u2019ve sat the exams and you\u2019re waiting for the results.\u201d Joe\u2019s state primary school worked hard to keep up with his appetite for maths; his secondary, St Paul\u2019s independent school in Barnes, south-east London, has an established tradition of entering pupils in maths competitions.  His gift was soon spotted by the UK Mathematics Trust, which runs contests in schools to scout for talent, and when Joe was 14 he enrolled in a summer camp for exceptionally talented young mathematicians. Since then he has attended training camps and last year he was chosen to represent the UK at the IMO in Cape Town, where he won a silver medal as part of a team that came 20th overall (the top three was China, USA and Taiwan). \u201cThere are obviously countries that are stronger \u2013 China, America, Russia,\u201d Joe says philosophically. \u201cIt\u2019s natural because of the population size and they put a lot more effort into it as nations.\u201d This year Joe, whose father works for IBM and whose mother is a geneticist, is hoping for gold. \u201cIt always works best when you\u2019re enjoying it,\u201d he says. In the runup he\u2019s been doing one or two problems a day, gradually building up as the competition approaches. \u201cSometimes I sit at my desk. Sometimes I lie on my bed and stare at the ceiling, trying to think. Sometimes I watch the TV and I\u2019m thinking.\u201d     Benton\u2019s primary school worked hard to keep up with his appetite for maths. Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris    Last year, the little-known world of the IMO was the backdrop for a well-reviewed feature film, X+Y, starring Asa Butterfield as a mathematics prodigy who has difficulty understanding people but is very good with numbers. He represents the UK at the IMO, during which there\u2019s a romantic encounter with a fellow competitor, a Chinese girl called Zhang Mei. The film triggered much debate among the world\u2019s best young mathematicians, both for its portrayal of a gifted young \u201cmathlete\u201d on the autistic spectrum and its love interest. In reality \u201cthere\u2019s not much romance\u201d, says Joe\u2019s teammate Warren Li, 17, an IMO veteran with two competitions under his belt. Indeed, there aren\u2019t many girls. Only 10% of all competitors are female, a situation that organisers are trying to address with the launch of girls-only international contests such as the European Girls\u2019 Mathematical Olympiad. It\u2019s not because of a lack of female talent, says the UK team leader Dr Geoff Smith, of Bath University (played by Eddie Marsan in the film). \u201cGirls can do this. Sometimes the best young mathematician in the world is a girl.\u201d Lisa Sauermann, from Germany, was the most successful participant in the 2011 IMO and currently ranked second in the IMO hall of fame; last year Maryam Mirzakhani, an Iranian former IMO gold medal winner and now a maths professor, became the first woman to win the world\u2019s most prestigious mathematics prize, the Fields Medal. On the film\u2019s portrayal of maths prodigies, Smith says: \u201cThere has been a natural concern in the maths community that portraying some mathematicians as being less than socially fluent is dangerous, because it could lead to the misapprehension that mathematicians are all strange. \u201cMy personal view is that the prefix \u2018mis\u2019 in the previous sentence can be deleted. All mathematicians are strange because they place such an exceptional value on thought, ideas and understanding. I think that the maths community should be proud of the way it embraces people on the basis of their enthusiasm for, and interest in, mathematics. \u201cMost students are relaxed and outgoing, with the full set of skills that allow them to prosper in the teenage social maelstrom. Some others are not, but everyone gets along almost all of the time, united by a passion for ideas and ingenuity.\u201d Each year the UK team is made up of students from a mix of state and independent schools, selective and non-selective. Despite concern among politicians about the overall maths performance of UK pupils in international Pisa tests (Britain ranked 26th in maths out of 65 countries most recently), we hold our own in the IMO. \u201cFor our population, we do reasonably well,\u201d says Smith. \u201cThe south-east Asian teams tend to dominate. In the last 10 years China, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Taiwan have been very strong. Kids there are expected to put a lot more effort into their school work and academic achievement is more highly prized. Europeans have made a cultural decision that they don\u2019t want to do that. Their idea of childhood is much less driven.\u201d Smith says the diligence required to master a GCSE or A-level syllabus in maths bears little relation to the sort of creativity and brilliant insight required to excel in an IMO competition. \u201cYou can\u2019t teach that,\u201d he says. \u201cThe kids who eventually make the IMO team, they are so smart they stand out like a sore thumb when they are 12, 13 or 14. It\u2019s like the difference between being an Olympic swimmer and being able to do a width.\u201d Warren Li is definitely an \u201cOlympic swimmer\u201d and among the UK\u2019s best hopes for a gold this year. He aimed for gold last year but just missed out. The other team members are Lawrence Hollom, Samuel Kittle, Neel Nanda and Harvey Yau. \u201cI was probably not as well prepared as I could have been,\u201d says Warren, who studied at a York comprehensive before moving to Eton for sixth form. \u201cThis year, I\u2019m aiming for gold again, and this time I\u2019m the most experienced member of the UK team. Maybe I feel a little pressure to be the best. But I really enjoy the whole process. It\u2019s actually fun.\u201d     Are you a maths genius?

Shares were also lower in Taiwan and Southeast Asia.

Moore\u2019s law states that every 18 to 24 months processing power will double and it has been steadily observed to be true since 1965, enabling the rapid technological progress over the last four decades. It had been thought the law could finally be disproved as it became too difficult to make ever smaller transistors. (The smaller the transistors, the more can be fitted onto the same size chip, which increases the number of calculations the chip can make and so increase its processing power.)           Moore\u2019s law explained.    The last major chip breakthrough was in making 14nm transistors, and doubts were raised about whether silicon-based processors could get much smaller due to the physics of atom sizes and the microscopic scale. Transistors use grooves etched in silicon to guide electrons around the chip. The channels do a similar job to that of wires, but on a much smaller scale. Making these grooves just 7nm wide means you can fit more transistors on the chips. For comparison a strand of human hair, at 100,000nm thick, is about 10,000 times wider than the channel. A red blood cell is a thousand times bigger, at 7,500nm in diameter. A strand of DNA is in the same order of magnitude, but slightly smaller at just 2.5nm wide.     Red blood cells Photograph: Ikon images/REX    At 7nm it is extremely difficult to control the electrons flowing through the transistors, but IBM claims to have worked out a system and prototype chips that operate at that scale. The product of its partnership with New York State, GlobalFoundries, Samsung, and a $3bn investment in next-generation chips announced last year, IBM claims its new processors will be four times more powerful than today\u2019s chips with up to 20bn transistors on a single chip. To reach 7nm IBM and partners switched to a silicon-germanium material, instead of pure silicon, for crucial sections of the chip. New manufacturing techniques will be required to produce the chips which may complicate high-speed mass manufacturing currently possible at larger sizes. While the prototype chips prove that 7nm transistors are possible and that the march of increasing processor power can continue for one more generation, IBM warned that it would take two years before chips made at 7nm scale would be available to buy.

Dredging, land reclamation and the construction of artificial islands could be swamping centuries old reefs in sediment, endangering ecosystems that play a key role in maintaining fish stocks throughout the region. According to leading marine biologist Professor John McManus, a proper understanding of the marine ecosystem and its role in food security is key to finding a solution to both the environmental and political issues.   McManus, Professor of Marine Biology &amp; Fisheries at the University of Miami, is more familiar than most with the region\u2019s contested reefs, atolls and shoals, having spent seven years in the northern Philippines monitoring seasonal fluctuations in coastal fish populations, amongst other things. McManus was puzzled to observe that dwindling fish stocks would recover seasonally, despite severe overfishing. \u201cAll of the South China Sea coastlines are over-fished, except maybe Brunei where oil rigs are refuges for fish populations,\u201d McManus explains. \u201cYet species would become locally extinct, then a year or two later they\u2019d be back.\u201d   McManus discovered that periodic \u2018pulses\u2019 of larval fish were being carried on shifting currents throughout the South China Sea, replenishing coastal fish stocks and that they were being spawned in the offshore reef ecosystems at the heart of the current geopolitical fracas.   Conflict over territory in the South China Sea is not new, with China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Brunei all staking contrary claims. It has been making headlines again since China began building artificial islands in the Spratly Islands \u2013 something of a misnomer since the archipelago covers an area the size of Tunisia, only 4 sq km of which is above sea level. Or was. According to McManus, as of June, satellite images appeared to indicate China had reclaimed a total of 12.82 sq km of land. In 2013, The Philippines filed an ongoing lawsuit at the UN International Court of Arbitration, questioning the legality of China\u2019s territorial claims and its development of tidal reefs that are only periodically above water, which it alleges violates the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos). China has refused to participate in the arbitration, questioning its validity.  China also claims its island building activities have caused only minimal, recoverable damage, but McManus, an expert in reef ecology, doubts this is the case. \u201cThe reef crest is a tiny thing about the same height as the tide range,\u201d he explains. \u201cThat\u2019s what is protecting everything \u2013 waves lose more than 90% of their energy when they hit the reef crest, reef flat and reef slope.\u201d What\u2019s more, this is an area that is prone to typhoons. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t build anything on an atoll without a wave-breaking crest in a big storm region.\u201d   McManus concedes that if you build behind the reef crest, the impact could technically be minimal. \u201cBut that\u2019s provided you haven\u2019t messed with the ecosystem that is continually building the crest \u2013 then it could wear down and wash away.\u201d China and to a lesser extent the other countries contesting the Spratly Islands, appear to have been dredging sand from within atolls, behind the fringing reef, effectively reclaiming land from the structure itself. \u201cThat sand is not a desert - it\u2019s an important part of the atoll,\u201d says McManus. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve found at least 20 areas that are being dredged like this.\u201d  Dredgers sweep back and forth, creating clam shell patterns in the sand that are clearly visible by satellite. In the process, they destroy whatever lives there, including reef-building organisms, turtles and giant clams, while sending up plumes of corrosive sand and sediment that settle on surrounding reefs, killing them, McManus explains. For the many scientists who are predicting that coral reefs globally are in danger of disappearing by as early as the middle of the century due to bleaching, ocean acidification and rising seas, the reclamation is comparable to switching off an ailing patient\u2019s life support.   Still, McManus is hopeful of finding a solution. He has long argued for a peace park in the Spratly Islands and now believes the time is ripe to broker a new agreement not unlike the Antarctic Treaty, which has been successful in preventing conflict and environmental degradation in the Antarctic since it was signed in 1959. \u201cWe need a joint resources management agreement, a code of conduct and a freeze on claims and all claim-supporting activities for 30 to 50 years,\u201d he says. This would prevent further posturing by any of the claimants, control the activities of fishing fleets and protect the ecosystems so vital to food security.   Then there is the potential for marine based tourism. The Spratly Islands are contiguous with the Coral Triangle bioregion, the pinnacle of marine biodiversity on the planet. Just 400 miles away, Tubbataha Marine Park off the coast of Palawan in the Philippines is an example of how an offshore reef can go from being over-exploited to successfully managed. A Unesco world heritage site that was set up in 1993, Tubbataha plays the same role as its counterpart in the South China Sea, stocking the entire Sulu Sea with fish. It has also been listed among the best dive destinations in the world. In the last couple of years, whale sharks as well as tiger sharks and other apex predators have been sighted in the park, a sure sign of a healthy, recovering ecosystem.   The Spratly Islands have similar potential, says McManus. \u201cThese are some of the most beautiful reefs I\u2019ve ever seen with some of the highest levels of biodiversity in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they\u2019re covering them with sand to build airports on them.\u201d Instead of a proliferation of military bases, there could be dive resorts and live aboard boats operating in these waters.  Unless of course this is about the oil and gas reserves beneath the Spratly Islands. But many now doubt the extent of these reserves and the potential for extraction. It\u2019s far more likely that China is consolidating its position in one of the most lucrative shipping channels in the world, part of its grand plan to establish a Maritime Silk Road through South and South East Asia to Africa and the Mediterranean. McManus hopes that having established its territorial claim - effectively by building it - China will now adopt a more conciliatory position. It is arguably in Beijing\u2019s interest to deescalate tensions, as it seeks to consolidate its position as a leader on the regional and global stage. It will not be able to do that by alienating its neighbours and conflict in the South China Sea could result in billions of dollars of lost trade. \u201cAntarctica has been one of the most successful environmental treaties in history,\u201d says McManus. \u201cChina is now in a position to benefit tremendously by taking the lead on this.\u201d "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/21/greece-britain-conflict-resolution-design", "publicationDate": "2015-07-21T14:54:25Z", "tags": [], "sentences": ["And Taiwan is poised to elect its first female leader after the two largest parties nominated women to contest January\u2019s presidential election."], "title": "Inside the 24 July edition", "article": "Conflict and resolution.

The P-8A Poseidon surveillance plane \u2013 one of the newest weapons in the Pentagon\u2019s arsenal \u2013 had taken off, with a CNN reporter on board, from Clark airbase in the Philippines, once part of America\u2019s largest overseas base complex during the cold war. After about 45 minutes, the plane reached its first target \u2013 which had, until recently, been an obscure, almost entirely submerged feature in the Spratly Island group. Fifteen thousand feet below, dozens of Chinese ships tossed at anchor. Their crews had been working day and night for weeks, dredging sand and rock from the ocean floor to fill in a stunning blue lagoon \u2013 turning a 3.7-mile-long reef that had only partially revealed itself to the daylight at low tide into a sizable man-made island nearly 1,000 miles away from the Chinese mainland. At the approach of the American aircraft, a Chinese radio operator can be heard addressing the pilot: \u201cThis is the Chinese navy. This is the Chinese navy \u2026 Please leave immediately to avoid misunderstanding.\u201d When the plane, which was busily photographing the land-reclamation effort, failed to heed these instructions, the operator grew exasperated, and the recording ends as abruptly as it had begun, with him shouting the words: \u201cYou go!\u201d   China's land grab in the South China Sea China\u2019s land grab in the South China Sea   For many people who viewed this clip, it might have almost passed for entertainment, but the plane continued on to a place called Fiery Cross, whose history and recent development point to how deadly serious the struggle over the South China Sea has become. Fiery Cross came under Chinese control in 1988, following a confrontation with Vietnam at a nearby site, Johnson Reef, where Chinese troops opened fire from a ship on a contingent of Vietnamese soldiers who stood in knee-deep seas after having planted their country\u2019s flag in the coral. A YouTube video of the incident shows dozens of Vietnamese being cut down in the water under a hail of machine-gun fire. China had come late to the game of laying claim to parts of the Spratly archipelago, which comprises hundreds of uninhabited coral reefs and sandbars flung across a vast area between the coasts of the Philippines and southern Vietnam, each of which has long controlled numerous positions in the area. But in this bloody way, China announced that it was fully committed. Its position on Fiery Cross Reef, staked out back in the 1980s, was initially justified under the auspices of Unesco, which had called on the nations of the world to cooperate in collectively surveying the oceans for meteorological and navigation purposes. Fast-forward 28 years, though, and as seen from the American surveillance flight, what had begun as an innocuous \u201cocean observation station\u201d, has now mushroomed in less than a year of dredging into the most important of Beijing\u2019s seven newly created positions in the South China Sea. From a single coral head that peaked a mere metre out of the waves, Fiery Cross has grown in stunning fashion, attaining a size of over 200 hectares of reclaimed land \u2013 roughly equivalent to about 280 football pitches. Leaving little doubt about its purpose, it has already been equipped with a 3,300-metre airstrip, which is long enough to accommodate a wide range of Chinese combat and transport planes, and a harbour big enough to handle even the largest of the country\u2019s ships. The primary attraction of this locale, though, may be something that cannot be perceived from even the most sophisticated surveillance plane, which from China\u2019s perspective is precisely the point. Fiery Cross appears to have been chosen by Beijing as the keystone in its push into the South China Sea because of the depths of its surrounding waters, which afford Chinese submarines far greater stealth in evading acoustic and other forms of active tracking by the US military.     The partially built airstrip on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands, in April 2015. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    There is no single explanation for why asserting its authority over the South China Sea now matters so much to China. Controlling the many tiny islands is in part a matter of controlling of the wealth assumed to lay beneath the sea in the form of unexploited minerals and oil and gas, not to mention the immense fisheries that exist in these waters. It is in part a matter of increasing the country\u2019s sense of security, by dominating the maritime approaches to its long coast, and securing sea lanes to the open Pacific. It is in part a matter of overcoming historical grievances. And finally, it is about becoming a power at least on par with the US: a goal that Chinese leaders are themselves somewhat coy about, but which is now increasingly entering the public discourse. The best place to see all these reasons at work is the country\u2019s southernmost province, the island of Hainan. * * * Right from the taxi stand at the ultramodern train station in semi-tropical Sanya, there was no mistaking how different this seaside city was going to be from the rest of China. It was late December and already frigid across the rest of the country \u2013 and even chilly in the north of Hainan island, from where my fellow disembarking passengers had all arrived. As we joined the long queue for cabs, people busied themselves peeling off layers of clothing, and making an ostentatious show of their resortwear underneath. There were two who stood out in particular, first the buxom lady in front of me in the low-cut knockoff Gucci T-shirt, who chewed her gum with a demonstrative little snap. Then there was the guy a couple of spots behind, but seemingly joined to her by a current of energy. He appeared to be well into his 40s, but he sported a boyband haircut, and wore a skimpy singlet and conspicuous gold chain. Every time our line turned a corner, sending the herded passengers ahead of us snaking back in the opposite direction, he leaned on the guiderails, smiling as he craned for a glimpse of her breasts. These were not nouveaux riches exactly, but they were exemplars of new Chinese wealth nonetheless, a wealth that is creating a giant middle class that is yearning to do all of the things that middle classes everywhere are wont to do, and not necessarily in stages either, but rather as hurriedly as possible, and, indeed for some of them, all at once. That, in fact, is a fairly complete explanation of Sanya\u2019s most famous raison d\u2019\u00eatre. It is, in the new China, a bucket-list city par excellence, a purpose-built place on the southern coast of Hainan Island that is kept warm year round by the currents of the South China Sea. In the winter, huge numbers of Chinese arrive here every week, much like pilgrims, except for the fact that their god, the god of leisure and consumerism, is of very recent vintage in this country. I, too, had come because of the sea, but not for any of its popular attractions. The beaches of Sanya have become famous among Chinese as their country\u2019s answer to Hawaii, but this is not the only thing the place has in common with America\u2019s 50th state. While the vacationing hordes headed off for the local version of Waikiki, long rows of fancy, newly sprouted hotels and vacation rental high-rises, I had come in hopes of getting a glimpse of the closest thing in China to Pearl Harbor. Just as a fast-expanding US used that naval base, beginning late in the 19th century, to project American power deep into the Pacific, an ocean that it would eventually come to thoroughly dominate, China is leveraging Hainan island to press some startling claims \u2013 not to mere dominance, but for rightful possession of virtually the entire South China Sea, a body of water that encompasses 1.35 million square miles, and through which more than $5tn in ship-borne trade passes every year. China\u2019s neighbours have watched with growing alarm as Beijing has used maritime vessels, often setting out from Hainan, to harass and intimidate the far smaller rival claimants whose littoral territories both enclose the South China Sea and lend it definition. Recently, for example, China sent a large flotilla of ships close to the shores of Vietnam as it deployed a billion-dollar oil rig that an official of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation described as \u201cour national mobile territory\u201d, while it made a show of prospecting for crude in deep water. As it did so, China kept a collection of much smaller, protesting Vietnamese vessels at bay by blasting them with massive water cannons powerful enough to sink many ships. At other locations, not far away, Chinese ships have intercepted vessels from the Philippines \u2013 sometimes by deliberately ramming them \u2013 to stop them from resupplying troops who guard disputed coral reefs that lie several times closer to Filipino shores than to anything conventionally understood as Chinese territory. It was against this backdrop that China began its own crash programme of dredging the oceans to build man-made islands in at least seven locations in the South China Sea in 2014.     The beaches of Sanya have become famous among Chinese as their country\u2019s answer to Hawaii Photograph: Getty Images/Lonely Planet Image    But there is much more at stake in China\u2019s plans for Hainan than the possession of a few spits of sand and rock hundreds of miles to the south. China\u2019s coastguard, until recently very modest in size, is growing so fast that by the next decade it will boast more tonnage than the coastguards of the US, Japan and all of its south-east Asian neighbours combined. The Chinese coastguard\u2019s ships are so large that they dwarf the platforms of many navies, blurring the lines that have traditionally distinguished these two services. And because its purpose is asserting mastery of the sea over a collection of far weaker neighbours to the south, much of this rising force will call Hainan its home.    The Chinese coastguard\u2019s ships are so large that they dwarf the platforms of many navies    For all of its strengths, where China\u2019s new maritime might is concerned, the coastguard is still the little league. With quite distinct purposes in mind \u2013 namely the increasingly intense security competition between Beijing and Washington \u2013 China is rapidly equipping itself with the world\u2019s largest submarine fleet, including a new force of nuclear ballistic missile vessels. It has also launched programmes to build a fleet of modern aircraft carriers, and the full range of associated battleships. In Hawaii, 5,800 miles away, the berths of the US\u2019s most formidable naval assets and that state\u2019s world-famous beaches are situated in different parts of the most-visited island, Oahu. But here in Hainan, just outside of Sanya, China\u2019s newest and most advanced naval docks and its best beaches are located practically right next to each other, and I had gone there in order to try to have a look. * * * China is two years into what figures to be the 10-year tenure of Xi Jinping as president and head of the Communist party; many observers already describe him as the country\u2019s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. The previous holder of this distinction was Deng Xiaoping, who is credited with ending Maoism, opening China to foreign investment and putting the country on a path of explosive growth that is now into its fourth decade. But even Deng had to contend with peers in the party hierarchy who were far more conservative than him. Most leaders in the post-Mao era have had to spend several years laboriously consolidating power before announcing anything that smacks of a personal agenda. As a measure of his ambition, Xi, by contrast, announced a watchword for his rule in his very first days in office, and it is one that the state media has never departed from. The new leader\u2019s agenda would be what he called the \u201cgreat dream of national revitalisation\u201d, which is often interpreted to mean lifting China to the first rank of world powers and reclaiming for it the preeminent place that every schoolchild learns was China\u2019s lot for the majority of recorded history. For most of the period between Mao\u2019s death in 1976 and the advent of Xi, China followed the adage, attributed to Deng, of \u201chiding one\u2019s capabilities and biding time\u201d. This meant, above all, deliberately keeping a low profile in the world while the country steadfastly accumulated wealth and power. From the outset, what Xi called \u201cthe China dream\u201d put a decisive end to all that. During his first year in power, without warning, China suddenly proclaimed a so-called ADIZ (air defence identification zone) that covers an expansive maritime area separating China from Japan and includes a hotly contested group of tiny islands, known as the Senkakus (Japanese) or Diaoyu (Chinese), which have been under largely undisputed Japanese control since 1895. China followed up on this action almost immediately with a series of gestures that seemed designed to demonstrate its restored strength to its southern neighbours. In Xi\u2019s early days in office, the country\u2019s first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, which was acquired several years ago from Ukraine and then extensively refurbished, was sent with a full battle group of other warships on a maiden cruise straight into many of the most fiercely disputed areas of the South China Sea.     China\u2019s first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning. Photograph: China Daily/Reuters    However muscular Xi\u2019s moves might at first appear, no one should think that he is a warmonger. China has as rich and sophisticated a tradition of statecraft as any nation, and a capacity for diplomacy of great subtlety. What the new Chinese leader has openly declared that he wants, though, is an Asia administered by Asians, and this is an idea that runs straight through Hainan island, and should be taken seriously. To grasp what it might mean requires thinking about the past as much as looking to the future. There is nothing more central to the China dream than China\u2019s idea of its rightful place in the world \u2013 which, Chinese people are relentlessly taught, they were robbed of first by European imperialism and then by an American-imposed Asian order that has been in place since the end of the second world war. Prior to this, for nearly the entire run of their nation\u2019s long history, save for the occasional parenthetical setback, the Chinese understand themselves to have enjoyed well-deserved paramountcy in the vastness of the east. This has meant not just preeminence, but deference from neighbours eager to curry favour and share in the fruits of China\u2019s brilliant culture. \u201cIn East Asia\u2019s tribute system, China was the superior state, and many of its neighbouring states were vassal states, and they maintained a relationship of tribute and rewards,\u201d writes Liu Mingfu, a retired People\u2019s Liberation Army colonel, in The China Dream, a hugely popular recent book that lays out plans for the country\u2019s return to preeminence. \u201cThis was a special regional system through which they maintained friendly relations and provided mutual aid. The appeal and influence of ancient China\u2019s political, economic and cultural advantages were such that smaller neighbouring states naturally fell into orbit around China, and many of the small countries nominally attached to China\u2019s ruling dynasty sent regular tribute \u2026 The universal spread of China\u2019s civilisation and the variety of nations that sent emissaries to China were simply a reflection of the attractiveness of the central nation, and the admiration that neighbouring countries had for China\u2019s civilisation.\u201d It is true that many territories paid tribute to China, which they may have judged to be a small price for gaining access to trade with the world\u2019s richest economy. But it is also true that China often used force to gain dominance over others, whether the Koreans or the Burmese or, most famously, Vietnam, which China occupied for 1,000 years. Through the teaching of history in this selective fashion, however, Chinese supremacy is made to appear to be the natural order of things, and never something that was forcibly imposed; hegemony, in Chinese usage, is a state of affairs that can only result from the actions of ill-intentioned foreigners.    Hegemony, in Chinese usage, is a state of affairs that can only result from the actions of ill-intentioned foreigners    Lingering threads of this kind of thought are evident in Beijing\u2019s interactions with Japan, its only conceivable rival in the region. That status is one that a fast-rising China appears increasingly unable to abide. Similar motivations can be detected in the recent proliferation of extraordinary infrastructure schemes, in which all new roads will lead to the Rome of the East, otherwise known as Beijing. These include new transcontinental rail lines with high-speed passenger service and immense freight capacity that will completely outclass Russia\u2019s badly aging Trans Siberian Railway, as well as the integration of south-east Asia into the Chinese rail network through Chinese-built railways in Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos. It also includes a maritime trade network of ports and depots that span the Indian Ocean, culminating in east Africa, an important frontier of China\u2019s expanding interests. Under one variation or another, Beijing has called all of these \u201cnew Silk Roads\u201d, an appellation that is meant to conjure Chinese centrality and grandeur. As it moved on all of these fronts, in the space of a mere two years, China has astutely built from scratch a major new multilateral bank, the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, which will be run under its leadership, competing with such western-led institutions as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, to fund construction projects that will inevitably play to China\u2019s industrial strengths. The US was caught off-guard, and perhaps feeling that its own 70-year-old imperium in Asia was threatened, responded by snubbing the bank even as 56 countries \u2013 including many old-line allies in Europe, not least Britain \u2013 rushed to join the new institution. As immensely ambitious projects such as these proceed, the gap in wealth and power between China and its maritime neighbours will continue to widen. Beijing\u2019s hopes for the future seem to align with the way China teaches the history of its imperial past \u2013 in which nearby states will pragmatically accept that the price of China\u2019s favour is deference. Still, in order to retain a sliver of legitimacy for its claims to rightful control of nearly all of the South China Sea, and to preserve the hope of a peaceful outcome in pressing these claims, China needs a respectable theory to justify them. And just as surely as it is building islands at sea, it has phalanxes of people working away to make that case. * * * In the bureaucratic wars that determine how Beijing allocates state resources, many players have recently discovered that invoking China\u2019s territorial interests in the South China Sea is the equivalent of pushing on a wide-open door. By now, as a result, the task of defending China\u2019s \u201csacred rights\u201d over this body of water \u2013 a stock phrase used in official propaganda \u2013 has become something of a mad scramble. At the top of the heap comes the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, a service that has one of the fastest-growing budgets in what is already a very rapidly expanding Chinese military. Next comes the China Coast Guard, a behemoth created in 2013 by the consolidation of four law-enforcement agencies that overlapped each other and routinely engaged in ferocious rivalries. Experts say that the integration is still far from complete, and that even oversight of the China Coast Guard is split between different authorities, each with its own rival interests. There is also the Ministry of Public Security, and something called the State Oceanic Administration. And this list only accounts for the national players. Beneath them come myriad provincial agencies and actors and big private companies that claim to promote law enforcement, to supervise fisheries, to explore for oil and gas, and to promote tourism. Probably the biggest boondoggle of all in this regard is Sansha, in the Paracel island group, which was declared in 2012 to be one of China\u2019s almost 300 prefectural level cities \u2013 an administrative designation typically reserved for places with millions of residents. Sansha, home to all of 1,500 civilians, is located on a mere dot in the sea called Woody Island \u2013 but China moved to elevate its status immediately after Vietnam passed a law declaring ownership of the Paracels, which are also claimed by Taiwan. All told, the Paracels consist of about 130 coral islands and reefs totalling less than three square miles in surface area. China has controlled the entire group since the 1970s, when it first used force to evict Vietnamese soldiers from the islands, a decade and a half before the shootout with Vietnam in the Spratlys. Since then, in an ostentatious fit of patriotism, the Hainan government and an array of Chinese corporations have lavished investments on public works and amenities of all kinds on the island, starting with solar panels, a power grid and a state-of-the-art desalination plant. Plans are now afoot to welcome cruise ships there, so that flag-waving Chinese tourists can be lectured on their country\u2019s inalienable rights to the region before setting off to gaze upon other rocky protuberances in the region that China claims as territory. Many of China\u2019s neighbours, and indeed the US, regard the assertion of its claims to tiny reefs and rocky formations located as far as 1,800 miles away from Hainan\u2019s coast \u2013 and sometimes only dozens of miles from other coastal south-east Asian states \u2013 as a bald-faced territorial grab, something faintly reminiscent of the European-led high imperial era of the late 19th century. The search for a theory that could help distinguish China\u2019s claims from a simple case of might makes right led me one morning to the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, in Haikou, the grey and chilly administrative capital of Hainan, to see its founding director, Wu Shicun. I had been picked up at my downtown hotel by two young men who worked at the centre and driven in a van through the rain to their workplace, which occupies a large, verdant plot located where the town petered out. There, I was met at the entrance by a pleasant young woman named Yang Yang, who would serve as my hostess. She led me into the institute through giant wooden doors and performed a quick tour of the impressive facilities, explaining that Dr Wu was tied up, and would be with me shortly. I was immediately struck by how everything seemed built to a standard of extra-generous spaciousness, as if crowds of experts regularly gathered here, and this insistently drew one\u2019s attention to the unavoidable fact that in room after room, there was no one around. Saddest of all, perhaps, was the capacious library, a space with a well-lit study floor full of desks, in addition, of course, to stacks, which I was told were full of volumes in both Chinese and foreign languages. There, I encountered but a single person \u2013 a rather pained-looking young librarian. When the tour was finished, Yang asked me if I would mind watching a short film about the institute, explaining that \u201call the guests do\u201d. As a photographer took pictures of me, perhaps for use in a scrapbook, the lights in the projection room were dimmed, and the movie began with images of coastguard ships ploughing through high seas, as a narrator spoke in English in a booming voice: \u201cThe advent of the ocean century brings with it unprecedented opportunities.\u201d A blue highlight flashed onto the screen covering virtually the entire South China Sea, right up to the shores of other neighbouring states. The narrator said nothing about risks, announcing instead: \u201cThe sea is crucial to the development of China and its future as a maritime state.\u201d When the seance had finally ended, I was led up the stairway a couple of floors to Wu\u2019s gigantic office, where he greeted me almost as a diplomat might, with a handshake and stiff smile from behind his large, wooden desk, his mane of silver hair swept back dramatically. I had been led to believe that my host was mightily busy, but as our conversation got under way, the impression one got in his formal, clutter-free office could not have been more different. In a meeting that lasted more than an hour, we were not interrupted, and never once did Wu check any devices for messages. The only other activity was performed by his assistant, Yang, who sat nearby throughout, taking notes. Wu launched into a historical explanation, telling me that China was the first to discover all the tiny islands that dot the South China Sea, the first to name them and the first to assert effective control over them. \u201cOur exercise of jurisdiction began as early as the Tang Dynasty, in the ninth century,\u201d he said, adding \u201c[all of these places] were under the administration of Yan County, in Hainan.\u201d He was not happy when I replied that I had spent the past few years studying this historical record for a book, learning \u2013 among other things \u2013 that although ships from as far away as Persia commonly travelled to China via the Malacca Strait, there is scant archaeological record of Chinese ships in maritime south-east Asian lands prior to the 15th century, not long before the first European imperialists turned up in the region, changing everything for ever. \u201cI thought he came here to discuss the law,\u201d he reproached his assistant sternly in Chinese. The onset of a fever in the region around maritime issues can be traced to China\u2019s revival of an artefact of its early-20th-century history, known as the Nine-Dash Line. This line, which made its first official appearance in 1947, under the nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek, encloses virtually all of the South China Sea in a loop that dangles southward from the Asian mainland in a shape that has been likened to a cow\u2019s tongue. Chiang was defeated two years later by the forces of Mao Zedong, after a long and brutal civil war, and for decades afterwards almost nothing was heard of the Nine-Dash Line. China set off alarms in the region when it began resuscitating the line early in this decade, giving it renewed prominence in state propaganda, and including it on a map contained in all new Chinese passports. At a 2010 ministerial conference of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Hanoi, the Chinese foreign minister responded to criticisms of its moves in the region by dressing down his Singaporean counterpart, telling him: \u201cChina is a big country and other countries are small countries, and that\u2019s just a fact.\u201d This created a feeling held widely in the region that despite a decade of soothing talk from Beijing about good-neighbourliness and win-win relations, China was reverting to an old form of behaviour, whether that of the wounded revanchist, or the central kingdom demanding obeisance. Since then, after losing in a showdown with China over Scarborough Shoal, a reef located 123 miles from its shores, the Philippines has taken the lead in the region in challenging China\u2019s sense of entitlement, bringing a case contesting the validity of the Nine-Dash Line before a tribunal under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos), and drawing repeated expressions of outrage from Beijing at its impertinence. China has vowed to ignore any unfavourable ruling by the tribunal, despite being a signatory of the convention. Similarly, Wu told me that China would not negotiate territorial issues in the sea on a multilateral basis with neighbouring states, nor would it accept outside mediation. This would leave no way forward, except for China\u2019s much smaller and increasingly dependent neighbours to negotiate with it one on one.     Protesters stage a rally outside the Chinese embassy in Manila demanding that China pull out of the contested Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Photograph: Dondi Tawatao/Getty Images    As set in stone as these positions sounded, Beijing\u2019s approach to control of the South China Sea has evolved in important, if subtle, ways since international public opinion, especially in the region, has turned critical of its actions. Most notably, China has seized on the vagueness inherent in the Nine-Dash Line, for which it has never attributed specific geographic coordinates, to suggest that people opposing it are tilting at windmills. \u201cChina has never claimed the entire South China Sea,\u201d Wu told me. \u201cChina just claims sovereignty over islands, reefs and features, above water or submerged, and also to adjacent waters. If an island can sustain human life that, of course, generates an EEZ.\u201d This term \u2013 standing for exclusive economic zone \u2013 means an area extending 200 nautical miles out to sea for China\u2019s sole economic use. But the only justifications Wu offered for China\u2019s claims to these features were the same historical arguments that we had already more or less agreed to disagree about, and which have no standing under the law of the sea. This led me, at last, to ask Wu what this was really all about. Why is it so important for China to control essentially all of this body of water, extending nearly 2,000 miles from its nearest conventionally defined coastline? \u201cThe reason that this has become an important issue is geopolitics,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe South China Sea is located at the edge of the Pacific Ocean, and this attracts the interest of many other countries \u2013 the US, Japan, India, and others.\u201d Others have long speculated about whether China\u2019s obsession was driven by an unproven conviction that the sea contained immense reserves of hydrocarbons, or whether it had more to do with fishing rights and food security. But Wu was now telling me that this was, in effect, about power. My visit to the institute concluded with a tour of a room full of wall-mounted maps, carefully assembled to build the picture of China\u2019s historical control over islands in the region, especially those in the Spratly chain. Once again, I was led by Yang, who stood off in the distance while I gave some of the maps a careful inspection. \u201cTime immemorial\u201d is a favourite official expression for explaining the duration of its claims to them, but as I looked at these old maps, I noticed that despite being written entirely in Chinese, the names of the islands were all phoneticised versions of the names westerners had given them in the 18th and 19th centuries. * * * It would be wrong to conclude that the Chinese position merely consists of cosmological bluster, even if it is true that there is plenty of that. Beyond the often glorified and euphemised imperial past, when neighbours reputedly prostrated themselves before the emperor in order to enjoy the privileges of trade, China draws on far fresher sources of motivation. Beijing\u2019s attitudes toward the South China Sea, like much of the country\u2019s behaviour as an emerging superpower, is bound up in an entirely modern Chinese obsession: overcoming the humiliations of the recent past. Since Sun Yat-sen, the early-20th-century founder of the Republic of China, every modern leader has harboured dreams of restoring the country to the position it enjoyed before imperial China was ripped asunder by Britain (and France) in the opium wars, and then trampled by Japan in a series of degrading wars that began in the 1890s. For Chinese leaders of the 20th, and now 21st century, that means restoring lost territories: most obviously Taiwan but also the Diaoyu islands. Just as important are the rights China is convinced \u2013 or has convinced itself \u2013 it deserves to the South China Sea. Sun\u2019s successor, and Mao Zedong\u2019s greatest historical rival, Chiang Kai-shek, began keeping a diary in 1928, in which he created a daily entry under the heading Xuechi, meaning \u201cavenge\u201d, or \u201cwipe clean humiliation\u201d. It came to include everything from venting about the need to destroy the \u201cdwarf pirates\u201d, which is how he often referred to the Japanese he was at war with, to the need to eventually create textbooks that would inculcate his ideas about the people\u2019s duty to restore China\u2019s size and glory. One entry reads: \u201cRecover Taiwan and Korea. Recover the land that was originally part of the Han and Tang dynasty. Then, as descendants of the Yellow Emperor, we will have no shame.\u201d Nationalism in China, which has swelled around these kinds of sentiments, has become a vital tool for the Communist party leadership. Yet officials have sometimes stoked these feelings in such a crude manner that it has become a hindrance to their freedom of action, and potentially even a threat to their own survival. When the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, said in June, for example, that any retreat by Beijing from its South China Sea claims would not be forgiven by future generations, he might as well have said that the country\u2019s leaders could not get away with compromise on these issues. But there is an even more recent imperative at work in Beijing\u2019s calculations than the matter of overcoming the humiliations of the last two centuries, and its name is the US. Today, it is that country and not Europe or even Japan, which is seen as the main obstacle to Beijing\u2019s regional ambitions. There is simply no way for China to reign supreme in the South China Sea so long as the US has a free run of the western Pacific. Even more than cowing its neighbours, China\u2019s island-building strategy would seem to have the US navy as its primary focus.    There is no way for China to rule the South China Sea so long as the US has a free run of the western Pacific    The waters off Hainan, near the Yalin navy base, where China maintains its nuclear submarine fleet, are notoriously shallow, scarcely 10 metres deep in many places, making it easy to spot submarines on their sorties from the island. By establishing a number of man-made island positions in the Spratlys, China seems to be pursuing a number of complementary goals. The first is reducing the ability of the US fleet to operate with impunity throughout the region. It is frequently noted that China\u2019s tiny new islets would be impossible to defend in a conflict, but that is to miss the point. By establishing radar and maritime acoustic arrays throughout the South China Sea, along with surveillance flights of its own, Beijing will improve its real-time information, or situational awareness in the region and enhance its ability to engage enemy combatants before they can approach the Chinese mainland. As noted, with its deep surrounding waters, a place such as Fiery Cross might also serve as a convenient way station for China\u2019s submarines. It may turn out that the encounter with the US Poseidon surveillance aircraft recorded by CNN was more than passingly revealing about China\u2019s ambitions for its newly built islands, and about the geopolitical contest that will unfold around them. Under Unclos, which China signed in 1996, and the US has never ratified, artificial islands built atop submerged features such as the reefs flown over that day do not entitle a country to territorial rights \u2013 and yet, there was the presumed voice of a Chinese soldier telling the Americans to go away. From declaring that it will not abide by any Unclos ruling against it, it would not be such a large step for China to depart from Unclos altogether \u2013 particularly since the US has never joined \u2013 and insist that its new positions in the South China Sea be given a wide berth by others, in the surrounding waters and in the skies overhead. Such a decision would be risky for China in terms of the image it would like to project as a peaceable and constructive rising power, but challenging it would be risky for others, not least the US. On the eve of a recent tour of the region, where he attended an annual Asian security conference in Singapore, the US defence secretary Ashton Carter vowed to frustrate any Chinese efforts to limit the movements of American vessels in the South China Sea. \u201cThe United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows, as we do all around the world,\u201d Carter declared in Pearl Harbor. And to this, he joined another vow. \u201cWe will remain the principal security power in the Asia-Pacific for decades to come,\u201d he said. Unsurprisingly, in China, people have begun to take a different view of the future. \u201cIn 10 years, our GDP will be bigger than the US, in 20 years our military spending will be equal to the US,\u201d said Shen Dingli, one of China\u2019s most prominent international relations scholars, who I met in Washington. \u201cThirty to 40 years from now, our armed forces will be better than the US. Why would the US defend those rocks? When you have power, the world has to accept. The US is a superpower today, and it can do whatever it wants. When China is a superpower, the world will also have to accept.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter: @gdnlongread  This article was amended on 28 July to correct an error: Japan\u2019s control of the Senkaku islands - which are known in China as the Diaoyu - dates to 1895, not 1879.

After a leaden first six months at the box office there, July has thrown up a titanic tussle between two megastars: moustachioed Telugu supremo Prahbas, and his war epic Baahubali, and Muslim main man Salman Khan, and his cross-border drama Bajrangi Bhaijaan. Baahubali, the country\u2019s much-trumpeted most expensive production to date, at $40m, was looking unbeatable after its record-breaking debut weekend on 10-12 July; its global take was 450 crore ($70.1m) after 17 days on release at the close of this weekend, according to the International Business Times. Which puts it in third place on the list of highest grossing Indian films, overtaking Shahrukh Khan\u2019s 2013 romcom Chennai Express (423 crore) and leaving just Aamir Khan vehicles Dhoom 3 (542 crore) and PK (740 crore) above it. But on the strength of what looks like a phenomenal overseas performance \u2013 reflecting Salman Khan\u2019s wider celebrity, not to mention the interest in the manslaughter case hanging over him \u2013 Bajrangi Bhaijaan looks to be on almost level pegging after just 10 days on deck. Wikipedia currently quotes it at 437 crore globally, which would mean it\u2019s taken nearly 200 crore outside of India, better than any Bollywood release apart from PK. Bajrangi Bhaijaan is a very Bollywood affair \u2013 an attempt to gild Salman Khan with some of his namesake Aamir\u2019s altruistic grace. A broad-shouldered CGI spectacular that holds its own with the best of Hollywood, Baahubali has more crossover appeal, so let\u2019s hope non-Indian audiences get the opportunity to lap it up.

The Chinese box office has a new champ: Monster Hunt, the $35m CGI/live-action fantasy from Hong Kong-born Shrek the Third director Raman Hui, had reached $220m at time of writing, passing 2012 buddy comedy Lost in Thailand ($204m) to become the highest grossing domestic film ever. It\u2019s undoubtedly benefitted from the July moratorium on new Hollywood films, but its performance has been explosive all the same \u2013 taking almost as much as Ant-Man\u2019s international run so far in just its home market plus a handful of Asian territories. Following a medieval village official impregnated with the tentacled heir to the monster kingdom, Monster Hunt is, according to Screen International\u2019s tentatively positive write-up, \u201cwholly Chinese in its portrayal of mythology, folklore and politics\u201d. At the same time, it feels like a step forward for the industry: the traditional elements that often restrict native film-makers have been finally lathered up into something new.             The inability to dream up new, galvanic formats has beenpartly responsible for Chinese cinema\u2019s lack of progress abroad, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see if Monster Hunt attracts attention beyond the diaspora. No questioning progress on the box-office front, though: in the first six months of this year, China was up 52% on the same period in 2014 (which was a 35% improvement on 2013). The No 1 local-film record has been broken three times since the turn of the decade: by 2010\u2019s earthquake drama Aftershock, Lost in Thailand, and now Monster Hunt. Compare that to three times in nearly 40 years in the US: Star Wars in 1977, Titanic in 1997 and Avatar in 2009. Top five Chinese domestic films 1. Monster Hunt (2015), 1.370bn yuan ($220m)2. Lost in Thailand (2012), 1.268bn yuan ($204m)3. Journey to the West (2013), 1.247bn yuan ($201m)4. Breakup Buddies (2014), 1.170bn yuan ($188m)5. The Monkey King (2014), 1.045bn yuan ($168m) Arcade dire After scoring an implausible 14 $100m+ US domestic hits since 1998, lowbrow king Adam Sandler may have dented his commercial prospects trying to reinvent himself for the blockbuster crowd in Pixels. Sony\u2019s high-concept sci-fi comedy \u2013 based on Patrick Jean\u2019s short film in which aliens unleash 80s videogame favourites on the Earth \u2013 had outsider potential in this year\u2019s box-office race, and with his track record, Sandler\u2019s presence in the ensemble looked like a bonus. But it\u2019s opened at $24m in the US, a long way under $69m for The Lego Movie, which the studio was using as a yardstick overseas. If the marketing whizzed along appealingly thanks to Pac-Man, Donkey Kong et al, an awkward fact couldn\u2019t be avoided in the actual film: Sandler unbalances proceedings, his typical lazy comedy filling the film with indulgent, nostalgic skits that continually threaten to bog down the neat visuals. Caught between this generational wallowing and the more urgent needs of an action film, Pixels was neither the four-quadrant all-embracer it might have been, nor did it successfully home in on any one group. It was too Sandler-ish and not sharp enough for the hipster crowd who might have been seduced by retro airs; not full enough of Sandler schtick for his core fanbase (his PG-13 work tends to open in the $40m vicinity); and surprisingly, with 62% of the US audience under 25, it looks like not too many 80s arcade-heads showed up either.     Lingering international appeal ... Pixels Photograph: Sony    But stop me if you\u2019ve heard this before: Sandler\u2019s lingering international appeal may win Pixels an extra life. $21.4m from 56 overseas territories isn\u2019t particularly strong, but there were enough bright spots to give Sony some hope, especially on a frugal $88m budget. Latin America, where Sandler\u2019s comedies go down a treat, was pumping in the quarters: Mexico ($3.7m) was almost level with The Lego Movie ($3.8m), and fellow No 1 debuts Brazil ($3.1m/$1.7m) and Argentina ($2.3m/$657K) were well ahead. The Argentine figure was the eighth highest opening in the country ever, and a record for Sony. The $200m or so needed by Pixels for a slender profit will take some recovery. But backed partially by China Film Group, the film is sure to get a big push there when it opens there on 15 September. So not quite game over yet. Brain trust           Inside Out - video review    While Minions has been noisily swarming all over the summer CGI animation front, Pixar\u2019s interior trek Inside Out has quietly claiming hearts and minds \u2013 and deserves more attention. Its staggered rollout, a few territories a week from mid-June onwards, means it never bashed the big box-office gong. But it\u2019s discreetly amassed $550.1m already, making it the company\u2019s eighth most successful film so far; $320.3m of that is the extremely impressive US take. Writer-director Pete Docter\u2019s creative intrepidness and emotional acuity has been rewarded with consistent \u2013 40ish% holds in the States \u2013 and Inside Out has been commanding similar loyalty elsewhere. Japan and Korea both dropped just -27% this week, and Australia actually saw +35% and +27% leaps in its third and fourth frames. The big opening this time ($10.9m in the UK) was one of Pixar\u2019s best 21st-century starts here, only bested by the more obviously commercial Finding Nemo ($12.3m), The Incredibles ($18.4m) and Toy Story 3 ($32.7m). Heartening to see that emotional depth can still put bums on multiplex seats. Inside Out should comfortably pass Cars 2 ($559.9m worldwide), Ratatouille ($623.7m) and The Incredibles ($631.4m) for fifth place on the Pixar scoreboard. A really stellar performance in its 20 or so remaining markets, which include a reputed October Chinese release, could see it past Docter\u2019s own Up ($731.3m) and Monsters University ($743.6m), and in the Pixar stratosphere with Finding Nemo and Toy Story 3; unimaginable for what looked like their trickiest proposition for years.

In ninth place globally with $19.5m was South Korean period thriller The Assassination, with Choi-Dong Hoon, director of 2012\u2019s fantastically exciting Ocean\u2019s Eleven ripoff The Thieves, returning with a tale of 1930s resistance fighters striking back against Japanese occupation. Only You, a Chinese remake of the Marisa Tomei-Robert Downey Jr comedy starring Lust, Caution actor Tang Wei, nabbed 15th place with $7m. And also from that way, the fifth in the Seer animated series based on an online game touted as the local Pokemon made $4m this weekend, and 18th global spot.

In 1981, the legend goes, Jane Birkin was on a flight from Paris to London when the contents of her handbag spilled over the aisle. The man sitting next to her commented that she could do with a tote with pockets. He happened to be the CEO of Herm\u00e8s \u2013 such things can occur in first class \u2013 and the pair started brainstorming ideas on the back of a sick bag. The holdall they created has become fashion\u2019s ultimate status symbol. Demand is kept high with exorbitant costs (\u00a3146,000 if you want yours diamond-studded), long waiting lists and obsessive fans (Tamara Ecclestone keeps her 30-strong collection in a glass case; Kate Moss used hers as a nappy bag).     A crocodile-skin Birkin bag. Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images    So it must have been a blow to the French luxury house that Birkin has asked for the Birkin Croco to be \u201cdebaptised\u201d until \u201cbetter practices in line with international norms can be put in place\u201d. Her statement followed claims from Peta that some of Herm\u00e8s\u2019 suppliers are treating the crocodiles and alligators who provide the bag\u2019s leather with appalling cruelty. Fashion companies have long named products after celebrities. In 1977, Herm\u00e8s renamed its \u201cSac \u00e0 d\u00e9p\u00eaches\u201d as \u201cthe Kelly\u201d, after Grace Kelly used it repeatedly, notably to hide her pregnancy bump from the paparazzi. It\u2019s a strategy Mulberry has employed, too, most famously with its Alexa satchel. But can Birkin get her name back? Mike Gardner, head of intellectual property at law firm Wedlake Bell, thinks not. \u201cI suspect Jane Birkin would struggle to compel Herm\u00e8s to stop using the Birkin name,\u201d he says. One of the problems is that Birkin does not have the term trademarked for leather goods \u2013 but Herm\u00e8s does.     Peta activists protest outside a Herm\u00e8s store in Taiwan. Photograph: Chiang Ying-ying/AP    \u201cIf Birkin had given some kind of licence to Herm\u00e8s to make use of the name over the years, she might be entitled to object or even terminate,\u201d he adds, but details of a formal agreement between them have not come to light. Rather, their relationship is described as a \u201cfriendship\u201d \u2013 Birkin has said that Herm\u00e8s gives her around \u00a330,000 a year, which she donates to charity; the actor is seldom photographed without a Birkin on her arm. Falling out with a muse is far from chic, however, and Herm\u00e8s will be keen to smooth this over quickly; the company has issued a statement reassuring Birkin that investigations are in hand. All of which explains why so many celebrities \u2013 from David Beckham to Jamie Oliver to Rihanna \u2013 are trademarking their names. Alexa Chung, for example, applied for one in 2010 for everything from \u201cpreparations to the hair, scalp, skin and nails\u201d to leather goods \u2013 the same year the Mulberry Alexa became fashion\u2019s favourite bag, funnily enough. Because it is only by making it official that celebrities can truly control their own hard-won cachet."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/01/ko-jin-young-womens-british-open-turnberry-south-korea", "publicationDate": "2015-08-01T18:43:05Z", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport"], "sentences": ["And now, playing in what is not only her first Women\u2019s British Open but her maiden major championship, yet another Korean, the 20-year old Ko Jin-young, is the joint leader, alongside Teresa Lu of Taiwan, after 54 holes at Turnberry."], "title": "Ko Jin-young and Teresa Lu share third-round lead in Women\u2019s British Open", "article": "Six weeks ago, on a trip to South Korea, David Leadbetter heard what he thought was the future of women\u2019s golf. \u201cThere are apparently 2,000 girls over there aged between 14 and 19 playing off handicaps of scratch or better,\u201d reports the renowned swing coach, who works with Lydia Ko, the world No2, and the former US Women\u2019s Open champion Michelle Wie. \u201cThat\u2019s an amazing figure. I think we can see where the ladies game is headed.\u201d Too late, it looks as if it has already arrived. Last year, playing in her first major event, Kim Hyo-joo won the Evian Masters. Last month, in only her third grand slam appearance, In Gee Chun claimed the biggest prize in the game, the US Women\u2019s Open (seven Koreans have now won that title since Pak Se-ri became the first in 1998). And now, playing in what is not only her first Women\u2019s British Open but her maiden major championship, yet another Korean, the 20-year old Ko Jin-young, is the joint leader, alongside Teresa Lu of Taiwan, after 54 holes at Turnberry. Both are eight under par, one shot ahead of Norway\u2019s Suzann Pettersen. Other notable luminaries are also lurking close by. Inbee Park is three shots back, needing only a victory here to complete the Grand Slam of major successes. Minjee Lee, the former world No1 amateur and now the highest-ranked Australian professional, is alongside Park, as is Lydia Ko after an up-and-down 72 on Saturday. Further emphasising the shifting order within the women\u2019s game, not one American is either under par or to be found in the top 14 players on the leaderboard. The European contingent is not faring much better. Only Pettersen from the Old World is in the top seven. The world rankings, too, reflect a new way of things. As of Saturday, only one-third of the top 30 players are eligible for next month\u2019s Solheim Cup matches between the US and Europe in Germany. By way of contrast, 17 players within the top 30 are Korean, or of Korean extraction, which only underlines the strength in depth in that part of the world. \u201cIn Korean junior events, they have such big entries they have to have a week\u2019s worth of qualifying just to get into the tournaments,\u201d continues Leadbetter. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably competitive. So the girls are better prepared when they get to the LPGA Tour.\u201d   Related: Donald Trump uses Scottish golf course visit to slate Obama and Hillary Clinton    On a happier note for fans of the old establishment, a little lower down the leaderboard sit a couple of highly promising young British players who have not yet made the leap from the Ladies European Tour to the relative riches of America\u2019s LPGA circuit. Strangely, neither is named Charley Hull \u2013 who is tied for 49th after a 77 on Saturday \u2013 but rather Mel Reid and Amy Boulden. Reid was eventually the more spectacular of the two, nipping home in 31 shots for 69 to rise into a tie for eighth place, one shot ahead of Boulden. The 21-year-old Welsh girl \u2013 BBC Young Sports Woman of the Year in 2008 \u2013 is three under par for the week after a best-of-the-day 68 vaulted her up to a tie for tenth. \u201cGrowing up in Conwy, I am used to the wind,\u201d said Boulden, the 2014 LET Rookie of the Year. \u201cI grew up playing links golf. So that is definitely helping me this week.\u201d Boulden came to Turnberry after a promising tied eighth finish in last week\u2019s Ladies Scottish Open at nearby Dundonald. As it has been for Lydia Ko and Pettersen, a few days\u2019 golf by the seaside has proved ideal preparation for more of the same. Which is not a word used too often these days in women\u2019s golf.

The communique was hashed out after two days of wrangling over how hard to pressure China on its controversial drive to expand tiny reefs and build military posts in the disputed waters. China claims most of the South China Sea, through which $5tn in ship-borne trade passes every year. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei also have overlapping claims.

They also included envoys from two dozen other nations such as China and the United States. A day after voicing concern to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi over the potential \u201cmilitarisation\u201d of the South China Sea, Kerry said freedom of navigation must be maintained. \u201cLet me be clear: the United States will not accept restrictions on freedom of navigation and overflight, or other lawful uses of the sea,\u201d he told reporters. Diplomatic sources said the Philippines and Vietnam \u2013 which have been in the most direct confrontation with China \u2013 had called for strong language. But they said there had been pushback from Beijing\u2019s traditional allies among the association. Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar traditionally side with China within Asean.

China has previously refused to recognise Tokyo\u2019s claims to an exclusive economic zone around Okinotori, which lies about halfway between Guam and Taiwan, 1,700km (1,050 miles) from Tokyo. \u201cBefore criticising others, Japan must first take a good look at its own words and behaviour,\u201d Wang said. The United States and south-east Asian nations have called for a halt to further island-expansion and construction by China. Wang, however, said Wednesday that land reclamation had \u201calready stopped\u201d \u2013 a claim some diplomats said was met with scepticism at the gathering.

In the past year, prominent examples of youth activism have included the Black Lives Matter movement in the US, which has brought issues of police brutality to the attention of media worldwide. Other youth-led movements have sprung up around the world to call for government action on a range of social issues.  Young people are thinking up more creative ways to get their voices heard. \u201cRap against rape\u201d was the brainchild of two young Indian women using poignant lyrics to express the mood of the country\u2019s growing feminist movement.

Related: Kitchens of the Great Midwest by J Ryan Stradal review \u2013 carrot cake, coronaries and comedy    For great food writing, however, the lamp in our spine as readers demands more. The best food writing \u2013 about any kind of food \u2013 elevates it, recreates it, and broadens it with a keen sensory cubism. A great writer will make us hunger for things we\u2019ve never eaten, conjure a consuming nostalgia from a list of ingredients, and make us feel like we\u2019re dining well as we\u2019re reading well. It was tough to narrow it down to 10, and I\u2019m leaving out some great titles that you\u2019ve already heard about, but here are a few favourites.  1. The Gastronomical Me by MFK Fisher \u201cFor the first years of my life, there was a series, every summer, of short but violently active cannings. Crates and baskets and lug-boxes of fruits bought in their prime and at their cheapest would lie waiting with opulent fragrance on the screened porch.\u201d Fisher, a Michigan native whose lifelong passion for food, and food writing, was inspired by her early years in France , is the mother of modern mainstream food writing. Though some argue that her legacy has created a smothering, circumscribed sense of what constitutes the genre, there\u2019s no arguing that her work is at its very foundation. 2. Pow! by Mo Yan \u201cDuring the day they made meat-filled dumplings and rolled noodles to feed the Koreans; at night, after the restaurant closed, they cooked a pot of dog meat and opened a bowl of strong white liquor. Each of them held a dog\u2019s leg \u2013 two legs out of the pot, and two more inside \u2013 with its bewitching aroma, waiting to be eaten.\u201d Nobel prize winner Mo both retells his childhood in post-Cultural Revolution rural China as burlesque and critiques his country\u2019s modern-day government in this surreal, wonderful, visceral novel set in a meat-obsessed town called Slaughterhouse Village. 3. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl \u201cMany times a day, he would see other children taking creamy candy bars out of their pockets and munching them greedily; and that, of course, was pure torture.\u201d One of my favourite books from childhood. Dahl conjured a world commensurate to the fantasies of many children, both in the justice meted out to Charlie\u2019s ill-behaved peers and in the fantastic elements of the factory. I teach a workshop a couple times a year at an educational non-profit organisation called 826LA where I have elementary school students create a country from scratch \u2013 drawing the map, writing the laws, designing the flag and so on \u2013 and chocolate rivers and edible realms are amazingly common even among kids who haven\u2019t been exposed to Dahl\u2019s work. I hope one day for a comprehensive and unintentional revision.  4. Like Water For Chocolate by Laura Esquivel I first read this book in high school, and quickly realized that the adjectives \u201clush\u201d and \u201csensual\u201d evolved in speech to describe works such as this. The unusual structure, the fervid descriptions of food, the Mexican revolution setting, the sex, the violence, and aspects of magical realism in all of the above combined to blow my staid midwestern mind. 5. Cheap Novelties by Ben Katchor \u201cIn the past, Mr. Knipl had been forced, by circumstances, to watch this public display of a man\u2019s need for cheap carbohydrates.\u201d Katchor\u2019s illustrated stories of solitary urban photographer Julius Knipl, who tacitly observes the author\u2019s version of a mostly-vanished New York, are often preoccupied with the lonely city dweller\u2019s relationship to food. Eating alone at cafes, calling for public mustard dispensers and bemoaning the lost moments of afflatus that followed a Bromo-Seltzer, Katchor\u2019s protagonist is as much wonderer as wanderer \u2013 and between his experiences and conjecture lie a humorous and quietly profound survey of the overlooked aspects of the urban food experience.     Reckless and indulgent ... Anthony Bourdain. Photograph: Heathcliff O'Malley/REX    6. Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly by Anthony Bourdain \u201cGood food is very often, even most often, simple food.\u201d  At the time Bourdain\u2019s first book came out, I don\u2019t recall there being anything quite like it. His cynical, brash, and detailed look at the demanding milieu of restaurant kitchens and his often reckless and indulgent rise through the ranks is entertaining and revealing. For good reason, it helped make him a superstar. An essential title in contemporary food writing. 7. Beard on Bread by James Beard \u201cGood bread and good butter go together. They are one of the perfect marriages in gastronomy, and they never fail to cheer me.\u201d There\u2019s a reason that this book is beloved by my characters Lars and Eva Thorvald \u2013 I love it. This is the first cookbook I found myself cracking open and reading as if it were a novel. 8. Good and Cheap by Leanne Brown \u201cI designed these recipes to fit the budgets of people living on SNAP, the US programme that used to be called food stamps. If you\u2019re on SNAP, you already know that the benefit formulas are complicated, but the rule of thumb is that you end up with $4 per person per day to spend on food. This book isn\u2019t challenging you to live on so little; it\u2019s a resource in case that\u2019s your reality.\u201d Leanne Brown\u2019s guide on eating well for US$4 (\u00a32.50) per day, available in print and as a free PDF, is one of a chorus of welcome retorts to the notion that one cannot eat both well and inexpensively. With recipes like Filipino Chicken Adobo, Spicy Broiled Tilapia with Lime, and Potato and Kale Rolls with Raita, along with suggestions for how to reinvent the leftovers, it\u2019s a book for anyone. 9. Counter Intelligence: Where to Eat in the Real Los Angeles by Jonathan Gold \u201cLos Angeles is the best place in the country to eat the cooking of Thailand and Burma, Guatemala and Ethiopia, Taiwan, and any of a dozen states of Mexico.\u201d Dubbed \u201cthe high-low priest of the Los Angeles food scene\u201d by Dana Goodyear in the New Yorker, there is arguably no other food critic that is as important to and revered by a city as Gold is to Los Angeles. Counter Intelligence, a compendium of his celebrated print series of the same name, captures everything that\u2019s wonderful, wise, disarmingly informal, humorous, and discerning about the Pulitzer prize winner\u2019s (the first ever for a food critic) work in one volume.  10.

Of course, we know that truthing is always a lonely path, which the dedicated conspiracist is fated to tread with only countless other wingnuts and the odd US presidential hopeful for company. But advances in technology, coupled with regressions in self-esteem, mean that it has never been easier for our celebrity rulers to counter claims that they are faking their pregnancies. Only this week, Kim Kardashian decided to crack down on speculation that she was doing what so many celebrities do: faking a pregnancy using an ever-expanding set of state-of-the-art prosthetics for all trips out of the home for at least six months, while the real baby is incubated remotely, either in an indentured civilian girl or a laboratory birthing pod in Area 51. For weeks, the truthseekers have been convinced Kim is engaged in just such a conspiracy against the public. Their corners of the internet teem with snaps of her bump looking a bit smaller on a day after it has looked a bit bigger, with QED captions that tantalisingly decline to address the fact that the only thing more of a hassle than being pregnant would be faking a pregnancy. Consider this batshit form of picture research the Loose Change of the pregnancy truther movement, and realise that the less supportive of Kim\u2019s Spandex separates are just more lies put out by the Pentagon.   Related: Why Kim Kardashian\u2019s pregnancy selfie would turn Titian on    In response to this growing body of evidence that her body is not growing at a remotely credible rate, Kim responded the best way she knows how: by stripping in a sparse modernist setting, positioning her iPhone at the precisely calibrated number of degrees to confirm her status as the greatest master of Dutch angles since Carol Reed, and capturing her naked form in a selfie heralded as some kind of landmark moment in the women\u2019s movement by people who seem to understand such things. Luckily, the lighting is easily dim enough to give the truthers hope: I doubt they\u2019ve seen a less convincing shadow than the one across Kim\u2019s belly since those created by the lunar module in 1969. In the meantime, let\u2019s remind ourselves that Kim is far from the first celebrity to have masterminded a false flag gestation: she was preceded most recently by Beyonc\u00e9. The evidence that Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z faked Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s pregnancy with their daughter Blue is overwhelming, as long as you haven\u2019t been playing with a full deck since the Roswell incident. It comprises: some awkward creasing in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s dress when she stood up during a chatshow appearance; the (admittedly) stunning fact that she contrived to give birth in a New York hospital without any number of members of the caring professions selling the details of it to the media, and some uncertainty about a shifting due date. Plus the suggestion that it was Jay Z\u2019s lovechild with someone else, or Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s dad\u2019s lovechild with someone else.     Beyonc\u00e9: can\u2019t be real. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage    But inevitably, as far as celebrity pregnancy conspiracies go, the mother of them all \u2013 or rather, of none of them \u2013 was Katie Holmes, whose union with noted Scientologist Tom Cruise created the perfect storm of circumstances to render the idea of an ordinary pregnancy as outlandish as any of Daddy\u2019s beliefs. A rundown of all the theories about the Cruise-Holmes progeny would be impossible in this space: suffice to say that little Suri Cruise was widely accepted, among people who widely accept such things, to have been spawned in some quasi-magical way, as you might expect of Scientology\u2019s destined messiah. Biggest traction was achieved by the idea that she was carried by a brainwashed surrogate out at Gold Base, the Church\u2019s heavily fortified international headquarters in the California desert. You probably think the fact that Suri emerged after nine months looking an adorable cross between her parents as a counter to several of these assumptions \u2013 but then, you probably think the CIA didn\u2019t invent Aids. Encouragingly, this sort of sophistication no longer separates us from the animals. Barely a couple of weeks ago it was revealed that a notable giant panda in a Taiwanese zoo had staged a phantom pregnancy, only to be rumbled on the ruse when experts gave her an ultrasound. Yuan Yuan is the second giant panda believed to have faked her pregnancy, with last year\u2019s effort by a Chinese one resulting in an expert suggesting that the animals are now pulling this stuff to get extra food and better accommodation. \u201cAfter showing prenatal signs, the \u2018mothers-to-be\u2019 are moved into single rooms with air conditioning and around-the-clock care,\u201d he told the Chinese state news agency. \u201cThey also receive more buns, fruit and bamboo, so some clever pandas have used this to their advantage to improve their quality of life.\u201d With only a single breeding Kimye couple in the world, the parallels are too obvious to state.     Yuan Yuan (on right): pretending to be pregnant for extra bamboo. Photograph: Reuters    Elsewhere in celebrity pregnancy mania, meanwhile, there are important philosophical developments. The practice of journalists falsely implanting babies in celebrity wombs has been going on for decades, but this week Leonardo DiCaprio won damages against a French magazine for a story headlined: \u201cRihanna pregnant with Leonardo\u2019s baby: he doesn\u2019t want the baby.\u201d The publication is called Oops!, which I am pronouncing in a sarcastic French accent even though it doesn\u2019t have the local duck-feet quote marks round the title, and its owner has been ordered to run an apology over a third of the front of its next issue. Yet this Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Truskolaski must be short of a coverline for the issue after that, because instead of sucking up his punishment, he doubled down on the offence with a declaration that Leo is \u201ca pervert\u201d with \u201ca racial issue\u201d. \u201cDiCaprio almost systematically goes out with Aryan-type girls, always blond hair,\u201d he justified. \u201cHe could not stand the fact that our magazine was saying he was having a baby with a black girl.\u201d Oof. As for the veracity of his original tale, as far back as June, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric was opining of Rihanna\u2019s pregnancy: \u201cWe didn\u2019t know. We thought she might be. We were not sure, of course.\u201d Clearly, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric is an enemy of racial stereotyping in all its forms, but he does seem to be making an idiosyncratically French point \u2013 probably while enwreathed in Gauloises smoke \u2013 about existentialism and celebrity pregnancy. I would like to see his teaching adopted as expert canon by the celebrity truther movement, whose rational relationship with the search for meaning could probably use a bit of a leg-up. Finally, before we conclude, I must inform any truthers tempted to dash off a quick 323 communiques to me \u2013 sent two to three minutes apart throughout the night \u2013 that I make a special point of passing on all email addresses to the secretive world government, which comes round and puts a surveillance implant in one of your upper molars while you\u2019re sleeping. So please: before you put jabber to keyboard, work out if you can afford to compromise the movement\u2019s security in this way."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/aug/19/weatherwatch-dukes-middle-east-heatwave-alaska-landslides-hurricanes-atlantic-pacific-el-nino", "publicationDate": "2015-08-19T20:30:00Z", "tags": ["Meteorology", "El Ni\u00f1o southern oscillation", "Landslides", "Hurricanes", "Middle East", "Alaska", "Taiwan", "US weather", "Climate change", "Environment"], "sentences": ["But El Ni\u00f1o does not provide such favours to the Pacific, and following on from the deadly Typhoon Soudeler this month, Taiwan was bracing itself as Typhoon Goni strengthened in the western Pacific and was forecast to reach the island by Sunday."], "title": "Weatherwatch: Waterlogged in Alaska\u2019s archipelago", "article": "Searing heat continued to take its toll in the Middle East in the past week as the heatwave that began in late July showed little sign of ending.

A sell-off in commodity markets. Capital flight from some of the world\u2019s riskier countries. Hints of a looming currency war. Financial markets ended last week in panic mode as fears emerged that the world was about to enter the next phase of the crisis that began eight years ago in August 2007. Back then, the problems began in the developed world \u2013 in American and European banks \u2013 and spread to the rest of the world. The bigger emerging markets \u2013 China and India most notably \u2013 recovered quickly and acted as the locomotive for global growth while the west was struggling. There was talk of how the future would be dominated by the five Brics countries \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2013 and by 11 more emerging market economies, including Turkey, Indonesia, Mexico and Nigeria. That has happened. Emerging market countries are dominating the news \u2013 but for all the wrong reasons. And because, after years of rapid growth, they now account for a bigger slice of the global economy, a crisis would have more serious ramifications than in the past. Emerging markets have a habit of causing trouble. For a quarter of a century after the Latin American debt crisis erupted in Mexico in 1982, the story was of a storm moving from the periphery of the global economy towards its core, the advanced nations that make up the G7. Mexico ran into fresh problems in 1994, there was an Asian debt crisis in 1997, and a Russian default in 1998 before the dotcom bubble burst in 2001. That proved to be a dress rehearsal for the near meltdown of the global financial system in 2007-08. Now the focus is back squarely on emerging markets. The problem is a relatively simple one. In the post-Great Recession world, the tendency has been for all countries to try to export their way out of trouble. But this model works only if the exports can find a home, as they did when China was growing at double-digit rates. But in the past 18 months, the Chinese economy has slowed, causing problems for two distinct groups of emerging-market economies \u2013 the east Asian countries that sell components and finished goods to their big neighbour, and countries that supply China with the fuel and raw materials to keep its industrial machine going. China\u2019s slowdown has led to a slump in the price of oil and industrial metals. In theory, this should have no net effect on the global economy because lower incomes for commodity-producing countries should be offset by the boost to countries that import commodities. It hasn\u2019t quite worked out that way. Consumers in Europe, Japan and North America have not used the windfall from cheaper energy to go on a spending spree. Meanwhile, emerging market economies are hurting badly. With the western economies one new recession away from deflation, China is making its exports cheaper by devaluing its currency just as oil producers are flooding the world with crude in a bid to balance their budgets. In the past three decades, there has been a crisis every seven years on average. Financial markets are well aware that recovery from the last downturn remains unfinished. The nervousness is easy to understand. China China sent markets into a spin this month after it revealed an 8.3% decline in exports in June. In an attempt to reverse the slump, Beijing began devaluing the yuan. The devaluation persisted for three days, raising investors\u2019 anxiety levels. Could there be worse to come? The answer came last week, when a survey showed that in August, activity in China\u2019s factories shrank at the fastest pace in almost six and a half years. Export demand had dwindled further, and domestic sales were not much better. China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, is wrestling with the effects of a massive increase in production using borrowed funds following the financial crash. Property developers in particular went on a building binge using cash borrowed from US banks. A report by credit rating agency Moody\u2019s said a devaluation of the yuan by more than 10% would raise the cost of financing their debt to unsustainable levels \u2013 they would start going bust. So far, the devaluation amounts to about 3%. Even if Beijing sticks with the yuan\u2019s current value, Washington could upset its calculations. September is the month many analysts have pencilled in for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Although one effect of China\u2019s slowdown may be to stay the Fed\u2019s hand, if it does raise rates, the resulting boost to the dollar would have the same effect as a cut in the yuan, putting those building sites from Nanjing to Chongqing back in jeopardy, along with the trillions of dollars invested in them. Russia, Turkey and Kazakhstan In any list of vulnerable emerging economies, Turkey has to be near the top. Its major companies have borrowed heavily on international markets, mainly in dollars. The cost of this has been ultra-low since the 2008 crash, but is now rising in response to hints of a US rate rise. Turkey is now a major manufacturing hub for European and US businesses. Millions of young Turks are employed by foreign companies, which are now scaling down production in response to declining world trade. These problems, combined with a war on its eastern border, have sent the Turkish lira to an all-time low against the dollar. Russia is in a similar position, but has the benefit of massive savings. It was Moscow\u2019s good fortune to have surplus oil and gas to sell in the high-price years \u2013 and the discipline to bank some of it. Like in Turkey, a queue of corporations have begged for help in paying the interest on their foreign debts. And as in Turkey, the currency has crashed. The rouble is at its lowest level against the dollar since February. And oil-dependent Kazakhstan has spent $28bn this year buying its own currency, the tenge, to prop up its value, but gave up last week. On Thursday the tenge plunged by more than a quarter and President Nursultan Nazarbayev said that with most its rivals devaluing, Kazakhstan had been forced to act. \u201cNo one could have stood aloof from this [currency] storm,\u201d he said. Africa Little of Africa remains untouched by the Chinese. Beijing has outstripped allcomers as a source of funds and now accounts for $3 of investment to every $1 from the US. Whether they are a source of minerals, metals, oil, agricultural produce or labour, few countries have missed out. Figures from Fathom Consulting show that the stuttering Chinese economy has already interrupted trade flows. From a peak between 2011-2013, African trade with China has almost halved. Among the most exposed countries is Sierra Leone, which, having just recovered from the Ebola outbreak, relies on exports of iron ore and titanium. Angola, which supplies China with oil, is in a similar position. A broader calculation shows Zambia the most vulnerable. Here, investment from Beijing accounted for 7.5% of domestic output in 2012. With the sale of ores and metals making up around 80% of its goods exports, Zambia is also hit by falling commodity prices. Oliver White, economist at Fathom, says many African countries will be unable to balance their budgets without spending cuts following what is likely to be a huge fall in oil \u2013 and mining-related tax revenues. Latin America Latin America has a long history of financial crises stretching back to the late 19th century. It was the scene of debt defaults in the 1980s and a number of countries are suffering from the crash in commodity prices. Most concern centres on Brazil, not just because it is Latin America\u2019s biggest economy but because of its cocktail of economic and political risks. Output is falling, inflation is in double digits, and it is running big budget and current account deficits. No president in Brazil\u2019s history has been less popular than Dilma Rousseff, who is embroiled in a corruption scandal and faces calls for her impeachment. Shweta Singh of Lombard Street Research says Brazil typifies almost everything that can go wrong with an emerging market: \u201cIt faces huge risks. Admittedly, that has been the case for most of the post-global financial crisis period. A new development, however, is a severe deterioration in the political backdrop, which threatens the adjustments the economy badly needs.\u201d The collapse in commodity prices also comes at a bad time for Argentina, Latin America\u2019s third-biggest economy, which is already battling with stagflation \u2013 an inflation rate close to 30% and no growth. Oil-dependent Venezuela, meanwhile, is running a 20% budget deficit and a current-account deficit of almost 5% following the collapse in the cost of crude. Analysts are also keeping a close eye on Colombia. South-east Asia South-east Asia looks much better-placed to cope with turbulence than it did 18 years ago. Then, the collapse of the Thai baht had a domino effect throughout the region, hitting Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea. The experience was chastening, and those countries used the proceeds of export-led growth to build up substantial foreign exchange reserves for use when their currencies come under attack. In 1997-98 all four were running sizable current account deficits; today only Indonesia is in the red. Gareth Leather of Capital Economics says comparisons with 1997 are overdone: \u201cThere are more differences than similarities between the situation now and the position many Asian countries found themselves in in 1997-8. The exception is Malaysia, where comparisons with 18 years ago are not entirely wide of the mark.\u201d As oil producers, Indonesia and Malaysia have been hit by the drop in the cost of crude from $115 to $45 a barrel. The risks to Malaysia are exacerbated by excessive credit growth. China\u2019s slowdown and the devaluation of the yuan will also have an effect on two other groups of Asian countries. Low-cost manufacturers, such as Vietnam, will eventually find it harder to compete, and more advanced economies \u2013 including South Korea and Taiwan, which provide components to Chinese manufacturers \u2013 will see demand for their exports decline."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/25/sylvie-guillem-in-sydney-to-be-free-on-stage-you-need-to-have-been-disciplined", "publicationDate": "2015-08-25T05:53:15Z", "tags": ["Sylvie Guillem", "Dance", "Ballet", "Culture", "Australia news", "Sydney", "Stage"], "sentences": ["I am still going to have that.\u201d  Guillem is in Sydney as part of her international farewell tour, Life in Progress, which travels to France, Taiwan, China, Singapore and New York before finishing in Japan on 30 December."], "title": "Sylvie Guillem in Sydney: To be free on stage, you need to have been disciplined", "article": "Sylvie Guillem will take her final bow at midnight on 30 December as she performs Ravel\u2019s Bolero at the Kanagawa Kenmin hall in Toyko.

At 19 she became one of Rudolf Nureyev\u2019s \u00e9toiles, the company\u2019s highest rank for a ballerina. She was the youngest dancer ever to take the title. She went on to perform the lead role in William Forsyth\u2019s contemporary ballet, In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated, at Paris\u2019s Opera Garnier in 1987. The piece, commissioned by Nureyev, \u201cchanged ballet forever\u201d at a time when, according to Guillem, Paris Opera was \u201ca little bit dull\u201d. It was also the catalyst for the contemporary career she would later resume.  Guillem said her career would not have been what it was without Nureyev\u2019s mentorship, and the two had a close bond. \u201cHe did not speak much, and I did not speak much,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was impulsive, I was impulsive. We had an understanding.\u201d When interviewer Caroline Baum cited Nureyev as saying Guillem was the only woman he could imagine marrying, she replied simply: \u201cThat is between him and I.\u201d Nureyev was appointed director of the Paris Opera Ballet at a time when \u201cit was a bit sleepy in its reputation\u201d, Guillem remembered. \u201cBut when Rudolf came, he opened doors, he invited [choreographers that were] very fantastic, sometimes not so great.

Her repertoire with the ballet included Giselle, Manon and Juliet, among others.  Known throughout her career as \u201cMademoiselle Non\u201d, Guillem has always been decisive about her roles, both on and off stage. When asked about the moniker, she said her sense of control came from knowing what she wanted to give on the stage. \u201cI trusted my instincts,\u201d she said, \u201cIt is a very short career [and] I didn\u2019t have time to cope with the management of the company.\u201d     Sylvie Guillem in Mats Ek\u2019s Bye at Sadler\u2019s Wells in London.

The damaged work, 200cm tall, depicts flowers in a vase.  Sun dismissed later reports in Taiwanese media that the damaged art might in fact be a painting from another 17th-century Italian painter, Mario Nuzzi, valued only at about \u20ac30,000 (\u00a322,000). \u201cThere is nothing to respond to. Of course they are different,\u201d he was quoted in Focus Taiwan news as saying. The Web Gallery of Art, a database of European fine art, said Flowers was the only Porpora work that is signed and was painted in about 1660. Porpora was born in Naples but moved to Rome, where he worked for the Chigi family. Tsai Shun-Jen, the chief conservator, said the painting was very fragile due to its age. \u201cWhen we start working on the painting\u2019s restoration, the priority is to strengthen its structure, not retouching the paint on the damaged area,\u201d he said.

Possibly the most egregious blunder was committed by the casino mogul Steve Wynn, who elbowed Picasso\u2019s 1932 masterpiece Le R\u00eave. Wynn still managed to sell the painting in 2013 for $155m, a record sum.

Related: Boy trips in museum and punches hole through million-dollar painting    The painting he damaged is said to be worth \u00a31m, but let\u2019s not get sensationalist. It is no Leonardo \u2013 even though it was in an exhibition about Leonardo\u2019s work. This flower painting by one Paolo Porpora is a fairly minor baroque picture. It can and will be repaired \u2013 and the boy\u2019s family will not have to pay, because it was insured. Still, this incident makes me shudder.  Usually, incidents that involve artworks being accidentally damaged by visitors are easy to mock, because we don\u2019t think we\u2019d ever be that daft. The man who smashed three Chinese vases at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, was really, really silly. So was the fool who got stuck in a giant vagina sculpture. But I\u2019ve got to be honest: the fear of simply tripping and crashing into a canvas does haunt me.  I visit a lot more exhibitions than this poor kid, and sometimes visit museum laboratories and see paintings out of their frame being restored, or go behind the scenes at galleries to see new art barely out of its wrapper. I also have binges of looking at huge amounts of art in a day, often just after getting off a plane, to the point of physical exhaustion \u2013 and it does sometimes occur to me that it would be terribly easy to tilt over, put out a hand and \u2026 Disaster.      Restoration experts look at the damage to the painting. Photograph: TST Art of Discovery Co    This accident reminds us that it is impossible to completely protect works of art. You can improve museum security all you want, scan everyone, but short of putting each painting in every museum in its own glass-fronted security vault, like the Mona Lisa, it will never be possible to preclude every accident. A drink spilled the wrong way (although keeping drinks out of galleries helps there), or an accident with a selfie stick (at galleries that allow them) is always on the cards. Or someone who is just very, very clumsy can come along.  Should 12-year-olds be banned from art galleries? Should security be tripled? Of course not. Even when you exclude theft and vandalism, art galleries contain an inbuilt risk. That is as it should be. All things decay. Art is fragile and impermanent. We treasure masterpieces and preserve them assiduously, and are right to do so. But just as the universe will eventually run out of time, so will the Mona Lisa. The art that exists is a fraction of that which once existed. The glories of museums are lucky relics that somehow survived the wars, fires and deliberate destruction that have put paid to so many works of art.  The realisation that a simple accident can suddenly punch a hole in a 350-year-old canvas is a memento mori for art. Old paintings are very breakable things. And perhaps the vulnerability of art is a fundamental part of its beauty and meaning. I do not collect art, but I was recently given a wonderful contemporary painting. I love it, but with love comes responsibility. The difference between this original oil painting and a Picasso poster is that it is unique, and if it is damaged, that\u2019s a big deal. This definitely adds to the painting\u2019s preciousness and my relationship with it. I have to look after it \u2013 like looking after a person.  The work that museums do to look after art is an expression of human love and protectiveness, and these feelings obviously make up a lot of what we mean by \u201ccivilisation\u201d. It is a sentiment at the opposite extreme from what is happening in poor, undefended Palmyra.  But every effort to look after art is ultimately melancholic, for we know everything has its time. To love is to be hurt. And that includes by art.

But women outnumber men in university enrolment, make up a third of doctors and a majority of civil servants and teachers, and the country has a progressive and effective birth control programme. Japan Japan brought in women-only carriages on nine metro and suburban train lines a decade ago after reports that more than half of female passengers had been groped on trains around Tokyo.     Female passengers wait to leave Tokyo\u2019s Shinjuku station. Photograph: Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP    Japan has been accused of \u201cinstitutionalised inequality\u201d in its workplaces. There is an unofficial ban on female sushi chefs \u201cbecause women menstruate\u201d. And on average women take home 70% of men\u2019s pay for the same job. More than two-thirds leave permanent employment after having children. Married working women are sometimes demonised as oniyome, or \u201cdevil wives\u201d. Less than 10% of MPs in the powerful lower house of parliament are women. Japan is ranked 104th in a gender gap rating drawn up by the World Economic Forum, well below far poorer countries, from Zimbabwe to El Salvador and the Kyrgyz Republic. The gap has been deemed so damaging to Japan\u2019s economy and demographics that the conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe, last year promised to address it with \u201cwomenomics\u201d.

Photograph: Navesh Chitrakar/Reuters    Harassment, euphemistically known as \u201cEve teasing\u201d, is ubiquitous, but some Indian women see the separate carriages as a step back rather than a way to solve matters. The country\u2019s problem with sexual abuse came to worldwide attention in 2012 with the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman on a moving bus, but despite a wave of education and activism the statistics on sexual violence are still grim. Every day 93 women report rapes, and thousands of others are thought to go uncounted. India has one of the lowest rates of female participation in the labour force among emerging markets and developing countries, only around two-thirds of women are literate and a preference for sons has skewed the country\u2019s gender ratio, from infanticide of young girls to sex-selective abortion. UAE Dubai has women-only carriages on its metro during rush hours, the front seats on buses are reserved for women, and there are fleets of pink taxis driven by women for female-only passengers in several cities. According to Human Rights Watch, women in the United Arab Emirates are effectively second-class citizens. Among the restrictions they face are the need for permission from a male guardian to marry. Once married they are expected to be \u201cobedient\u201d to their husband and in most cases need his consent to take on paid employment outside the home. Women cannot pass citizenship on to their children, have more restricted access to divorce than men and can only have one husband while men can marry up to four women. Those who report rape or sexual assault risk being prosecuted for illicit relations. Egypt Egypt introduced women-only carriages on its metro in 2007, as women sought to escape a tide of harassment. UN research suggests 99% of women and girls interviewed for a UN survey reported that they had experienced some form of abuse on the streets. In the turmoil following the Arab Spring there have been a series of high-profile public attacks on Egyptian and foreign women, ranging from the 19 year-old stripped and attacked during an election victory rally last year, to the 2011 assault on reporter Lara Logan in Tahrir square. Sexual harrassment was only criminalised in Egypt last year, and the military under now-president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi forced female detainees to take virginity tests, which many saw as a form of institutionalised abuse. Female genital mutiliation is also practiced in Egypt. Around a third of Egyptian women are illiterate, and only around a quarter work outside the home. Indonesia Jakarta introduced women-only carriages on commuter trains in 2010, and in 2013 considered devoting entire trains to women passengers before dropping the system and reconverting the trains into mixed-sex travel. Brazil Rio de Janeiro brought in women-only carriages for rush hour on the city\u2019s metro in 2006, after concerns about widespread sexual harassment, but they are widely ignored and enforcement is sporadic. Mexico Mexico City also brought in women-only areas of platforms and carriages for rush hour, but enforcement is weak and there has been no survey of whether it has made any difference.  Other countries Malaysia in 2010 launched pink women-only buses and trains, and in the capital of the Philippines there are also women-only compartments. Taiwan experimented briefly with women-only carriages in 2006, but dropped the idea after a three-month trial.

The budget will be drafted into a bill in December and submitted to parliament for approval. Japan had been making annual cuts to its defence budget for a decade up to 2013. The increases since then reflect its growing anxiety about China\u2019s expanding naval reach. The rise is also in line with Japan\u2019s more assertive defence policy under the conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe, as he seeks to check Chinese influence and expand the scope of his country\u2019s military. Abe\u2019s ongoing attempts to push through legislation that would allow Japanese troops to fight alongside allies on foreign soil for the first time since the end of the second world war brought tens of thousands of people out in protest on Sunday. Monday\u2019s budget request, an increase of 2.2% on last year, demonstrates a shift in Japan\u2019s security emphasis from its northern maritime border with Russia to its long and porous southern reaches. In contrast to previous investment in tanks and heavy artillery, it is building a more flexible and mobile force \u2013 including its own version of the US marine corps \u2013 that would be able to quickly defend territory against an invading enemy.   Related: Japan defence paper warns on China and pushes for stronger military role    Japan\u2019s defence budget is still dwarfed by that of China, where military spending rose by more than 10% this year to \u00a390bn. China is second only to the US, which spent $581bn (\u00a3377bn) on defence in 2014, while Japan was ranked seventh, according to the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London. In 2010 China accounted for about 28% of defence spending in Asia, but by 2014 its share had increased to 38%, according to IISS. Japan\u2019s share of regional military spending, meanwhile, fell from 20% in 2010 to just below 14% last year. Much of the hardware included in Japan\u2019s new budget is designed to monitor outlying territories and repel any attempt to invade the Senkaku islands, which are administered by Japan but claimed by China. Japan is building a military radar station on Yonaguni island, just 94 miles south of the islands. According to a request submitted on Monday, the ministry\u2019s shopping list includes amphibious assault vehicles, stealth warplanes, F-35 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, F-35 fighters and an advanced Aegis radar-equipped destroyer. It also wants to acquire Global Hawk drones and surveillance helicopters to defend far-flung islands along an 870-mile stretch of ocean between the Japanese mainland and waters off Taiwan. The ministry is also seeking extra cash to build new military bases and expand existing ones on some of the islands, equipping them with state-of-the-art radar and missile batteries. Ministry officials have set aside \u00a358m to expand an army base on Miyakojima island, 188 miles east of Yonaguni, and \u00a347m to build a base on Amami Oshima, an island midway between the main Okinawan island and the Japanese mainland.

And a lot of the time we want to believe in their fantastic creations. Of course, most con artists and fraudsters are just out for our money, but the ones I\u2019ve picked out here wanted something else \u2013 often attention, but sometimes acceptance and occasionally love. 1. The forever teen: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin, 1997 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin was born in France in 1974. He started pretending to be other people when he was 16, running away to live on the road. In 1997, he was living in a Spanish hostel for homeless teens (he was still pretending to be only 16) when he saw a missing persons notice. He decided to become the boy in the picture: 17-year-old Nicholas Barclay, a blue-eyed American boy who\u2019d disappeared from his home in 1994. Barclay\u2019s sister went to Spain to meet Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, and even though Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric had brown eyes and a strong French accent, he managed to convince his \u201csister\u201d he really was Nicholas and went back to Texas with her. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric lived with the Barclays as their son for six months, before he was unmasked by a private investigator. He was returned to France and spent the next 10 years pretending to be various teenage orphans until 2007, when he got married and swore never to impersonate anyone ever again. He said he was always simply looking for love. 2. The girls who started a brand new religion: the Fox Sisters, 1848 Maggie, 15, and Kate, 12, lived in a small town near Newark in New York State. In 1848 their family were unsettled by furniture that moved of its own accord, and strange noises. Was the house haunted? Their astounded mother invited the neighbours round to witness the girls communicating with \u201cMr Splitfoot\u201d \u2013 the devil \u2013 and other spirits. Over the next few years the girls became national celebrities, holding s\u00e9ances for hundreds of people at a time. Some journalists were sceptical and it was noted that when the sisters sat with cushions under their feet, the spirits were strangely silent. A Boston newspaper and some Harvard professors set up a test to see if the girls\u2019 stories were true. The sisters failed \u2013 the professors discovered that the sounds of the spirits were made by the girls cracking their joints. But the Fox sisters\u2019 fame \u2013 and their new religion of spiritualism \u2013 continued to grow. People wanted to believe. In 1871, Kate travelled to England and worked as a celebrity medium, but Margaret made a full confession in 1889. They\u2019d made a career out of fakery but both eventually died in poverty back in New York.  3. The girl who became a boy who made a legend: Gwyna/Gwyn in Here Lies Arthur by Philip Reeve, 2007 Of course, it\u2019s not only real people who have told lies and tricked us \u2013 some of the greatest characters in fiction also find themselves in situations where the truth becomes a fluid thing that they can bend for their own advantage.  This book tells the story of Arthur and Merlin, but not as we know it. Myrddin/Merlin is more of a spin doctor than a magician, and Gwyna \u2013 a young girl orphaned by war \u2013 is tasked with making Arthur into something bigger and more powerful than a man: a legend. And really that\u2019s the magic in this tale: the secrets and deceptions behind the making of a king. Gwyna changes her identity at first in order to survive, living as a girl or a boy as Myrddin orders. But finally, at the end of the tale, she gets to choose her own identity and to make a new life for herself in which she can be whatever she wants.  4. The last tsarina of Russia: Anna Anderson, 1922 No one knew for certain what happened to the four daughters of the last Russian Tsar until their skeletons were discovered in 1991. That was eight years after the death of a woman who had lived as Anastasia, the youngest of the Romanov princesses. Anna wrote her \u201cautobiograph\u201d in 1957, which included the story of her incredible escape from Russia on a farm cart, a claim so far-fetched that many called it a fairytale. But in those pre-DNA testing days, she had as many supporters as detractors. The truth, of course, is much sadder. Anna Anderson was born Franziska Schanzkowka in Germany in 1896. In 1922, after a suicide attempt, she was admitted into a psychiatric hospital in Berlin where she refused to give her name. She was called Fraulein Unbekannt \u2013 Miss Unknown \u2013 and the staff said she spoke German with a Russian accent. A fellow patient told a Russian noble living in Berlin that Miss Unknown was in fact one of the four daughters of the Russian Tsar. The story spiralled from there. Many didn\u2019t believe her, but there were always people who wanted to her tale to be true. Anna Anderson\u2019s life ended in America where she died aged 87 in 1984. A post-mortem DNA test finally proved conclusively that she was not the tsar\u2019s daughter.     New York\u2019s legendary Studio 54 nightclub, where David Hampton\u2019s deception began. Photograph: Michael Norcia/Michael Norcia/Sygma/Corbis    5. The boy who conned Calvin Klein: David Hampton, 1984 David Hampton moved from small-town America to the bright lights of Manhattan at 17. He was good-looking and smart and the big city felt like an escape for a young gay man. One night, when he and his boyfriend were turned away from the famous club, Studio 54, they had an idea: David\u2019s boyfriend claimed he was film star Gregory Peck\u2019s son, and David said he was David Poitier, son of the Oscar-winning actor, Sidney. The pair were let in and after that David realised this new name would open all sorts of doors. Soon the rich and famous were letting him stay, first the odd night \u2013 he\u2019d spin a story about missing a flight, luggage already on the plane \u2013 then stay for months as a houseguest. He stayed with fashion designer Calvin Klein and film star Melanie Griffith, and his wit and charm found him dining in the salons of literary and academic New York. It was the life he had always wanted to live. His con lasted until he was arrested in 1984. A playwright and close friend of one of the academics David had duped wrote a hugely successful play about his deception - Six Degrees of Separation \u2013 which in turn became a massive film.

The girl whose name was a lie: Lyra in Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials trilogy, 1995\u20132000 Lyra\u2019s name tells us she\u2019s a liar from the start. But with Lyra it\u2019s always about self-preservation, usually to keep herself out of trouble or to protect those she loves. I expect all of us want to be her, running across roofs of Oxford Colleges, fighting and rampaging with mobs of feral children, hurtling across the ice clinging to a polar bear, don\u2019t we? Or maybe that\u2019s just me... 7. The woman who gave birth to rabbits: Mary Toft, 1726 Mary, 25, was married and with three children when claimed to have seen a rabbit which caused her to give birth to what she said were \u201canimal parts\u201d. She was examined by doctors, including King George I\u2019s royal surgeon, and gave \u201cbirth\u201d to a rabbit each day for nine days. Academic papers were written about her and Mary instantly became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. She was bought to London but under intense scrutiny, even though she went into labour several times, there were no more rabbits. Eventually she admitted it was all a hoax. She was imprisoned as a fraud and several of the doctors and surgeons who had believed her were ruined. Hogarth, the artist and satirist, led the mockery, publishing a famous cartoon: The Wise Men of Godliman in Consultation. Mary was released without charge and managed \u2013 eventually - to escape into obscurity.

The ultimate liar: Tom Ripley from The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia Highsmith, 1955 Tom Ripley is the only utter and completely amoral of my fraudsters. He\u2019s here because the books are spectacular. Tom is sent to Italy to bring home a poor little rich boy, Dickie Greenleaf, who is perfectly happy lying around on his yacht or on the beach. When Tom falls in with Dickie\u2019s set he finds himself more and more obsessed with him and his easy, glamorous lifestyle. Tom Ripley realises he\u2019ll do anything to live Dickie\u2019s life - including murder. Read the books before you see the film.. 9. The man who wrote a bestseller and invented a language: George Psalmanazar, 1700 This is, at least, a tale with a happy ending. George Psalmanazar \u2013 we don\u2019t know his birth name \u2013 was probably a Frenchman and spent his young life pretending to be from places that nobody else had been to. Ireland \u2013 his first choice \u2013 was clearly no good, as too many Europeans had actually been there so he eventually decided he would be from the then obscure island of Formosa (now Taiwan). He made up a language and wrote a guidebook to his country which stated that the people went naked except for gold or silver plates worn over the genitals and lived underground, and he made up a range of interesting customs cobbled together from reports of Aztec and Inca civilizations.  The book was a bestseller. His language in particular was a huge success \u2013 his Formosan alphabet was still being cited by academics in the late 18th century. The book kick-started a Formosan craze and Psalmanazar was even invited to speak at the Royal Society. But as the years passed, real reports from Formosa trickled in. They were nothing like Psalmanazar\u2019s book and in 1706 he confessed. He stayed in London and his hoax seems to have been forgotten. He got a job and moved in literary circles \u2013 he was a friend of Samuel Johnson \u2013 and one of his fans made sure he had a substantial pension. He lived to the ripe old age of 84. 10. The Princess Caraboo: Mary Wilcox, 1817 Mary Wilcox was a young woman in her 20s who had lived a very troubled life. Although born and bought up in the Devonshire countryside, she began work in Exeter as a nanny where she was noted for her storytelling skills. She wanted more though and as soon as she could, got a job in London where, after a tumultous time, she claimed to be a South-Sea princess kidnapped by pirates before escaping them by swimming to shore. It\u2019s hard for us now to fathom that anyone would have swallowed this story, but we have to remember that people wanted to believe.      Mrs Worrall, who took \u201cCaraboo\u201d in, was interested in anthropology and \u201cnoble savages\u201d from America to China; Princess Caraboo must have been the answer to her prayers. Long after Mary\u2019s fraud was discovered, Mrs Worrall paid for her to start a new life in America \u2013 she wrote to her, and I believe there was a real friendship between the two women. Mary\u2019s story ends well too. Although she failed to make it in the States \u2013 reinvention wasn\u2019t such a big deal there \u2013 she returned to the UK to start a very successful business breeding medicinal leeches for the Royal Bristol Infirmary. She got married and had a daughter.  Catherine Johnson is the author of The Curious Tale of The Lady Caraboo. She says: \u201cI haven\u2019t followed exactly the true story in my book The Curious Tale of The Lady Caraboo.

Even though it was the atomic bomb that precipitated the Japanese surrender and the American advance across the Pacific which had destroyed Japanese sea-power, it was the Chinese who had kept the bulk of Japan\u2019s land armies tied down on the mainland. Chiang\u2019s nationalist party, the Kuomintang (KMT), could rightly claim most of the credit, the communists playing a distinctly secondary role. Chiang and the KMT lost many battles, but they never gave up: the Japanese were never able to turn their energies and resources away from this battered but still resolute enemy. If they had been able to do so, the conflict in the far east might have developed very differently. Chiang would not relish his triumph for long. Within months, relations with the communists deteriorated. Within a year there was civil war, and by the end of 1949 the remnants of the KMT government had fled to Taiwan. The Chinese Communist party inherited the KMT victory, and built a modern China on that foundation. That is the real achievement that the Chinese government celebrated on Thursday by putting on a huge military show in Beijing. The claim, on the 70th anniversary of its end, that the communists won the war in China is flawed. But they did go on, after many bloody deviations, to create the strong China of which Chiang had also dreamed, a China securely seated at the top table from which he was so often humiliatingly turned away during the war. Nobody would now dream of leaving China out of a major international gathering in the way that the Nationalist government was left out of the Yalta conference in 1945, for example. Given the debt of gratitude owed to China for its part in the defeat of Japan, it seems churlish that a number of countries either refused invitations or sent low-level representatives, including the United States and Britain, although Tony Blair was there in a private capacity. The reason, of course, is that China\u2019s strength is an uncomfortable reality for neighbours alienated by its territorial claims, for the former enemy, Japan, and for western countries that want\u00a0to\u00a0signal disapproval of Chinese policies. Then there is the way in which the leading role of the nationalists has been written out.\u00a0At Taiwan\u2019s own end of the war parade, held in July inside a military base, Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou said the truth \u201cmust not be distorted\u201d. To be fair, mainland historians have in recent years given more weight to the KMT war effort, and Chiang Kai-shek himself is acknowledged as a leader of stature. But, finally, military parades have an intimidatory aspect which President Xi Jinping\u2019s peace rhetoric and his announcement about troop reductions on Thursday will not have done much to dissipate. The world needs a strong China but not a China whose strength is feared."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/08/europe-strengthens-ban-on-seal-products-after-wto-challenge", "publicationDate": "2015-09-08T15:24:40Z", "tags": ["Conservation", "Wildlife", "Animal welfare", "Animals", "Environment", "World news", "Canada", "European Union", "Americas", "Europe"], "sentences": ["The products that result from the killings, mostly fur, have now been banned by more than 35 countries, including the US, Russia and Taiwan."], "title": "Europe strengthens ban on seal products after WTO challenge", "article": "MEPs voted to tighten a ban on seal products on Tuesday, in a move that campaigners say will protect millions of seals from commercial slaughter.

Some Nordic MEPs had tried to introduce an exemption to the ban, where seal products came from hunts necessary to prevent over-population.

Related: Warning over Pacific bluefin tuna stocks as Japan meeting ends in stalemate    Activists from the ship Rainbow Warrior II boarded the tuna longliner Shuen De Ching No.888 on Wednesday and said they found it had no licence to fish in Pacific waters. But Greenpeace said Taiwan\u2019s fishing agency retrospectively rushed through paperwork for the ship with the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission after the activists lodged a complaint with both bodies. The Shuen De Ching sailed from Taiwan on 27 June and spent two months in the fishing ground about 1,300 nautical miles north of Australia before the apparently belated move to have its activity declared legal. Greenpeace campaigner Lagi Toribau told Guardian Australia from on board the Rainbow Warrior II it was now up to authorities to show whether this was \u201can administrative fault or really covering up the tracks of this vessel\u201d. \u201cPrior to us getting on board the vessel, we were able to get official confirmation from the relevant authorities in this region that this vessel did not have authorisation,\u201d he said.

This vessel has been out here for two months. If we did not find this vessel, then it could have been fishing in here for years and no one would have detected it or known how much fish they were actually taking out of the Pacific,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is worth billions of dollars to people.\u201d The activists claim they found irregularities in the ship\u2019s logbook around its tuna catch. Only three tonnes of fish were logged over the entire two months, Toribau said, a discrepancy that was often explained by the practice of longline vessels unloading catches to huge \u201cmotherships\u201d at sea. It logged only three sharks caught, whereas the sacks containing 75kg of fins suggested a haul of at least 42 sharks, they said. This suggested a \u201cclear violation\u201d of both Taiwanese and Pacific fishing laws, under which fins may not exceed 5% of the weight of the total shark catch. Toribau said the case, which comes as leaders in the Pacific Island forum work on a 10-year plan for a sustainable fishing industry in a region that supplies 70% of the world\u2019s tuna catch, highlighted glaring deficiencies in enforcement.

Liu Cixin\u2019s best novel Hugo award is one sign the tide is beginning to turn, even if The Three-Body Problem was very nearly kept from winning by an organised protest vote from what Ursula K Le Guin called \u201cinsecure white guys\u201d. But while western readers have been slow to notice it, or deliberately ignorant, SF literature is flourishing all around the world.

Photograph: Imaginechina/Rex Shutterstock    Liu Cixin may be its highest-profile star, but China\u2019s SF fandom is the largest in the world. Science Fiction World magazine reaches an estimated 1 million readers per issue, eclipsing equivalent US publications such as Analog. It\u2019s hardly a suprise that the nation experiencing the fastest economic and technological expansion in human history has a ravenous appetite for SF. But it remains to be seen whether Chinese sci-fi will emerge as the kind of oppositional force seen in communist Russia, as a cheerleader for unfettered technological development like the golden age sci-fi of the 1950s US, or a hybrid of the two. The Apex Book of World SF series is an excellent primer for any sci-fi reader trying to understand the field\u2019s global reach. The recently published 4th edition includes work by authors from Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Uganda, Mexico, Bangladesh and a host of others. Editor Mahvesh Murad, well known to sci-fi fans for the Midnight in Karachi podcast, is unequivocal when talking about the challenges facing world authors of sci-fi: \u201cThe misconception is that they won\u2019t be accessible to readers or easy to relate to, and so won\u2019t sell.\u201d  And in the US and European publishing industries, where a few gatekeepers can have an outsize influence on what gets published, such misconceptions have a visible impact on the careers of world writers. \u201cPart of me wants to answer with the word imperialism, but that\u2019s probably too flippant,\u201d says Murad. Flippant or not, the lingering echoes of colonial history surely play a part in the industry\u2019s choice to massively favour voices from western cultures. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not from a western mainstream cultural background, you see things a different way \u2013 your gaze is immediately removed from the mainstream\u2019s,\u201d Murad continues. \u201cYou have different problems, different solutions, immensely different worldviews. All that plays in to your writing. How can it not?\u201d That difference is immediately noticeable in the writing populating the Apex anthologies. Stories by Zen Cho, Usman T Malik and Haralambi Markov strike a new tone without which the SF genre would be much poorer. It\u2019s testament to the passion of sci-fi fandom that world voices are so often heard via small presses such as Apex, or the new platforms provided by crowdfunding and social media.

Photograph: Eric de Bodard    The African Fantasy Reading Group established by author Geoff Ryman on Facebook has become an invaluable resource for writers and readers seeking to connect with sci-fi literature from the African nations, sharing information on talks, open submissions for new work and new publications featuring African writers. Any observer of science fiction today would have to conclude that as Africa emerges from political strife and enters an uncharted phase of hyperspeed technological development, African writers are certain to produce much of the most fascinating sci-fi of the century ahead. Despite the challenges, world voices are trickling into mainstream genre publishing. Zen Cho\u2019s Sorceror to the Crown and Ken Liu\u2019s The Grace of Kings are two recent high-profile releases, building on a growing body of successful international sci-fi by Lauren Beukes, Aliette de Boddard and others. If any single theme unites these otherwise disparate voices, it is the retelling and reintegration of older, culturally specific mythologies \u2013 from African folktales to Chinese legend \u2013 into to the science fiction canon. It seems only logical that as sci-fi has become the mythology of today\u2019s globalised, technological world, it must in turn embrace the rich and valuable world mythologies that came before it."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/14/dalai-lama-uk-refugee-crisis-plea-interests-humanity", "publicationDate": "2015-09-14T12:23:24Z", "tags": ["Dalai Lama", "World news", "UK news", "Religion", "Refugees", "Migration"], "sentences": ["Related: I'm with the banned: China blocks Bon Jovi gigs    Last week, the Chinese authorities cancelled two Bon Jovi concerts in Shanghai and Beijing, reportedly because the rock band used an image of the Dalai Lama as a backdrop during a 2010 performance in Taiwan."], "title": "Refugee crisis: Dalai Lama in plea to put 'interests of humanity' first", "article": "National interests should come second to the interests of humanity, the Dalai Lama has said in relation to the global refugee crisis, as he praised the response of Germany and Austria to those \u201ccrying, starving and asking for help\u201d.

He added: \u201cThe billions of dollars spent on weapons could be spent on education and health instead.\u201d He called for religious harmony across the globe, saying that faith was depicted as the cause of conflict. \u201cPeople feel religion is a troublemaker [but in fact] religion teaches compassion, tolerance, forgiveness and contentment.\u201d The media, he said, should report love and harmony, not just focus on division. \u201cThe idea of a clash of civilisations is dangerous,\u201d he said, adding that Islam emphasised love, not bloodshed. The Dalai Lama, who turned 80 this year, also criticised China\u2019s \u201cpolitics of suppression\u201d, which he said makes it impossible for people to express their real views. The Chinese government has said it will designate the next Dalai Lama, rather than the figurehead being chosen through the traditional method where Buddhist monks identify their reincarnated spiritual leader after his death. The Beijing regime routinely vilifies the Dalai Lama \u2013 who has lived in exile in India since 1959 \u2013 over his demands for greater autonomy for Tibet. China says his true intention is independence for Tibet, and it strongly objects to heads of state, dignitaries and high-profile figures meeting with him.   Related: China unhappy at Cameron's meeting with Dalai Lama    The Dalai Lama is to meet MPs at the invitation of the all-party parliamentary group on Tibet, of which the new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is a member. The group exists to pressure the government \u201cto encourage negotiations between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government in exile, whilst recognising that Tibet is an occupied country which had independent links with Britain\u201d. There are no scheduled meetings with David Cameron or any government ministers. The Dalai Lama\u2019s visit comes just a month before the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, is due to travel to Britain for the first state visit in 10 years. Cameron and his then coalition partner, Nick Clegg, met the Dalai Lama in 2012, triggering a furious response from the Chinese, who accused the government of \u201cconniving at and supporting separatist attempts to achieve Tibetan independence\u201d. The following year Cameron led a large trade delegation to China, partly to repair the diplomatic damage over the Dalai Lama meeting. At the time, Downing Street said the prime minister had \u201cturned a page\u201d on the issue and had no plans to meet the Tibetan spiritual leader in the future.

It seems that the west, governments and civilians alike, is more concerned with a possible military threat than with the myriad human rights violations taking place inside the country.  North Korea is a country which denies basic rights to its people and has an economy teetering on the edge of collapse. Instead of settling for maintaining the status quo, ignoring the suffering of millions and simply hoping the crisis doesn\u2019t spill over the border, here\u2019s what the west should do about North Korea:   Related: North Korea says it has restarted all its nuclear bomb fuel plants    1. Stop worrying about a nuclear North  The DPRK isn\u2019t interested in getting rid of its nuclear capacity; the west has tried sanctions, the threat of military force, and (unfulfilled) promises of alternative energy assistance for 20 years with no significant effect. Given that North Korea watched as Libya denuclearised in 2003 and was invaded in 2011, this should come as no surprise. It\u2019s time to accept North Korea as a nuclear power and shift the focus from deterrence politics to human security. If anything, diplomatic efforts should go towards encouraging North Korea to sign up to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and submit to regular IAEA inspections rather than stubbornly insisting that disarmament is a hard prerequisite for engagement.   Related: North Korea's renewed nuclear threat keeps experts guessing    2. Continue joint military exercises with South Korea  The diplomatic utility of the annual exercises is two-fold: to remind the North (and China) of the US presence on the peninsula and to reassure western allies in the region (South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines). At the most basic level, military exercises maintain operational readiness and ensure effective integration between participating forces. Yet the war games are disproportionate and overly theatrical when compared to the potential threat posed by North Korea \u2013 and offer all stick but no carrot. 3. Engage in state-level diplomacy Here\u2019s the carrot: economic aid in exchange for human rights improvements. Avoiding the DPRK\u2019s economic collapse is ultimately in the interests of western governments \u2013 not only to avoid a human rights crisis but also to prevent an influx of refugees to China and South Korea. The aid should be targeted at meeting civilians\u2019 basic needs, for example food and healthcare. Economic aid is the other side of diplomacy, inverse to the use of military force, and would increase western influence over the North. North Korean diplomats are actually quite sane and reasonable. They have personal and national interests like any other diplomats; engaging with them would be mutually beneficial.  4. Recognise the limits of unofficial diplomacy  The last high-profile attempt at so-called track two diplomacy was in 2013, when Dennis Rodman went to the North to try to secure the release of Korean-American Kenneth Bae who was in prison on charges amounting to propagating Christianity. He failed (although Bae has since been released). The lesson is that celebrity athletes are not reliable sources of diplomacy and future track two efforts should be coordinated with government-level engagement. 5. Listen to defectors (critically)   Related: Why have North Korean defections dropped?    Refugees offer the most reliable insight into life beyond the DMZ, the conditions within prisons, and the activities of the regime. Unfortunately the western media rewards sensationalist stories and some defectors have taken to fabricating elaborate tales of espionage and involvement with secret organs of the North\u2019s government. This contributes to an already severe information deficit, silencing defectors who are telling the truth and hindering efforts at understanding the North.  6. Read North Korean propaganda The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) is the DPRK\u2019s state news outlet and one of only two printed news sources in the country, the other being Rodong Sinmun. KCNA offers unique insight into the official party line within North Korea. Many \u201cNorth Korea watchers\u201d read the English version online and scoff at how ridiculous the government makes itself sound with its petty and combative insults \u2013 but these readers fail to realise that they aren\u2019t the KCNA\u2019s target audience. The state news is directed toward citizens who have no access to outside news sources. It is not indicative of what the government thinks, rather it\u2019s a daily dose of Kimist propaganda and should be read accordingly. Interpreting the KCNA superficially would be to underestimate the sophistication of the government.  7. Support efforts by (some) human rights groups International governments are not the only relevant players in international security. NGOs are potentially able to access and assist vulnerable people where states are not. Support groups which facilitate the agency of North Koreans, help amplify their voices and give them access to resources; avoid those who claim to speak on their behalf.

QUAD, Sat to 15 Nov RC Prem Sahib, London Less is definitely more in Prem Sahib\u2019s subtly sexy art. To create his stripped-back work \u2013 using a monochrome palette and industrial materials \u2013 this young Londoner mines the city\u2019s erotically charged architecture and public spaces, be they cruising sites or dancefloors, for inspiration (he also co-runs Dalston gay night Anal House Meltdown). Up close, the paintings are coated with tiny drops of resin, like the sweating walls and bodies of an overheated nightspot. Puffa jackets are sealed clinically between glass, their squashed forms suggesting crowded bodies and masculine energy. Other works are more coded, such as his use of tiles from public lavs. One is imprinted with what looks like a landscape painting, but the leafy scene is actually the site of urban assignations.

In her characteristically dense new canvases, pale fashion divas wear monkeys as capes and hats, their skeletal frames clad in gossamer threads. Smith made a name for herself 10 years ago with exquisitely crafted works, merging the sinuous lines and decorative excess of gothic art with modern-day goth and a feminist critique of fashion\u2019s dark allure. This interest is still apparent, including references to one of the industry\u2019s recent great losses, Alexander McQueen.

The cliches of miserabilist confession are artistically sidestepped by framing each sequence in relation to the pre-existing films of such directors as Gus van Sant and Chantel Akerman. One semi-lost soul appears trapped in a carwash tunnel; another chops away at a field full of daisies with a pair of scissors. Castlefield Gallery, to 1 Nov RC Marcus Coates, London Over the past decade Marcus Coates has created a poignant, if oddball, social commentary on issues ranging from inner-city evictions to swine flu. His fish-out-of-water performances colliding art and life to absurd effect have, most famously, seen him don Joseph Beuys\u2019s famous guise of artist-shaman, strapping antlers to his head and engaging with communities. For his latest film, he channels the power of abstract dance in people\u2019s homes and offices in response to eternal questions such as: why does everyone go round and round without stopping, or why do we get so easily distracted from work? Amazingly, instead of crumpling over with laughter as he stands on his head in a kitchen or runs manically on the spot on an unmade bed, his interrogators\u2019 interpret his strange moves with thought and sincerity. What emerges is less a vision of art\u2019s ridiculousness than its ability to give people meaning.

The RA\u2019s 20-year survey is a chance to focus on his work. What\u2019s on show has a kind of chiselled poetry, balancing clear political messages with a nuanced, 21st-century take on craft traditions. This includes the bones of those who died in labour camps, reproduced in porcelain, and various comments on literal old and new values, with precious artefacts, be they temple remains or Neolithic pottery, reconfigured as contemporary art.

The thoughtful, eloquent Youssef believes chefs could learn a thing or two from the high street and we\u2019re sat in a showcase of consumer seduction, from the packaging that loudly shuns sell-by dates in favour of more emotive \u201cfreshness\u201d to the name above the door with its hint of continental chic. \u201cThe world now is all about experiences,\u201d he says. \u201cIn order to craft and design that experience [chefs] have to do what all your Starbucks and McDonalds of the world are doing and that\u2019s understanding the psychology of your diners.\u201d Having worked at the Dorchester, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Darroze at the Connaught and the Fat Duck, Youssef is unusual for a chef. He doesn\u2019t want to open a restaurant. Or a pub. Or even a street-food van. He\u2019s thrown in his lot with Oxford professor Charles Spence to probe the psychology of diners and learn what pushes their buttons \u2013 off the plate as well as on. The result is Youssef\u2019s brainchild, Kitchen Theory, a project that probes everything from the influence of sound on diners\u2019 perceptions of a meal to how best to persuade guests to embrace unexpected ingredients \u2013 insects included. It\u2019s a symbiotic relationship, with Spence\u2019s work inspiring Youssef\u2019s menus, and surprising results from Youssef\u2019s pop-up dining \u201cexperiences\u201d pointing to new avenues and approaches for Spence\u2019s lab. Three weeks earlier I found myself sat at a long table in a dimly lit room in Maida Vale, London, apprehensively awaiting Kitchen Theory\u2019s \u201cSynaesthesia\u201d experience. A seven-course dinner, it promised to reveal the many ways in which our senses interact when eating. It\u2019s a slightly deceptive title. Only around 4% of the population are synaesthetes \u2013 individuals who experience a unique and spontaneous association between senses, such as seeing a certain colour when a specific musical note is played. The familiar multisensory nature of flavour \u2013 incorporating sight, sound, smell, taste and touch \u2013 is different, and, says Spence, more of a \u201cblending\u201d of the senses. \u201cA common definition of synaesthesia would be an idiosyncratic condition,\u201d he says. \u201cSynaesthesia stays the same over life, whereas flavour, likes and dislikes change over time.\u201d The amuse bouche was four spoons, each filled with a colourful bubble of membrane-bound fluid. Our task was to match them with four anticipated flavours. A quick shuffle later and the majority of the room had opted for the same arrangement, matching red with sweet, green with sour, white with salty and brown with bitter. As the bubbles burst in our mouths, the latter rupturing forth the unmistakable notes of Guinness and chocolate, faces beamed in triumph. And so it went on, dish after dish probing the impact of music, aerosol sprays and even the feel of textured cubes on our gastronomic expectations and perceptions. Yet for all the quirky presentation and edible surprises, our interpretations were often similar. Were we secretly culinary geniuses? Had someone glimpsed a crib sheet? Or were we simply too polite to disagree? It turns out we were nothing special \u2013 yet it is that very intuitive agreement that Youssef aims to probe. \u201cIf it is something that we both agree on, why? If it is something that we disagree on, why?\u201d he says. It\u2019s research that could influence not only the presentation of fine-dining dishes, but also everyday foods and perhaps even shape what we eat in the future.          Youssef is not the first foodie to mess with minds in an attempt to unpick and augment our dining experiences. Heston Blumenthal has long been interested in the multisensory nature of eating and it was working with Spence that led to his signature dish \u201cThe Sound of the Sea\u201d \u2013 a selection of seafood served with an iPod mini and seaside soundtrack. Neither is Spence alone \u2013 although he is a leading figure in what\u2019s a growing field. Among its many studies is one from 2003 in which researchers from New Zealand probed the influence of colour on the aroma of wines. Connoisseurs and casual drinkers were given four types of wine, one white, one golden and two red. What they didn\u2019t know was that three of the wines were the same and only one of the reds was the real thing: the scientists had been tinkering with a food colouring. It turned out that both experts and novices were baffled. For the experts, words typically linked to pinot noir, such as plummy or berry-like, scored higher ratings when it came to describing the bouquet of the red-tinted sample than for the other samples of the same wine; the effect diminished when the wines\u2019 colour was obscured. Social drinkers meanwhile were poorer all round at judging wine aromas and haphazardly described the red-tinted sample with both red and white wine-related words. As for sound, in 2010 researchers from the food giant Unilever discovered that loud white noise can affect the taste of food, sapping both sweetness and saltiness, while Spence and his team have also explored associations between pitch and taste, finding sweetness and sourness to be correlated with high-pitched sounds, while bitterness could be augmented by low-pitched sounds. Even tactile experiences sway us \u2013 serving a dish with high quality, heavy cutlery, Spence has found, can increase how much restaurant diners like it and the amount they are willing to pay for it. And Instagrammers beware: a small 2012 study suggested that looking at images of high-calorie food is linked to a rise in levels of an appetite-inducing hormone, while research the following year found that looking at images of salty foods decreased enjoyment of eating a salted snack. A showman as well as scientist, Spence has a knack for the kind of research-based nuggets of information that might intrigue not only journalists but food and drink companies seeking competitive advantage in a crowded marketplace. For example, in a recently published study, Spence and colleagues discovered that adding swirls of \u201clatte art\u201d to coffee resulted in subjects being willing to pay 11-13% more for the drink. Some companies have been attempting to harness our senses for a while. Five years ago, Heineken unveiled a textured beer can with a raised surface that the company claimed made the can more tactile, boosting the appeal of the drink inside. In 2012, McCain also went multisensory, wooing the public by pumping the smell of jacket potatoes into bus shelters and, the following year, through the frozen food aisles of Asda and Tesco. However, employing psychology for profit is riddled with potential traps. While flavour might be multisensory, the associations we make between our senses are not necessarily a foregone conclusion. When presenting subjects with a brown drink, Spence and colleagues discovered that the majority of youngsters sampled from the UK expected a cola taste, while those from Taiwan were most likely to expect it to taste of grape. Links between flavour and shapes or word-sounds aren\u2019t universal either. For westerners, bulbous shapes and soft-sounding words such as \u201cbouba\u201d are typically matched together and with fatty or sweet foods, while bitter and sour flavours are linked to sharp and angular shapes and sounds such as \u201ckiki\u201d. But not everyone agrees. \u201cWe have been giving dark chocolate and carbonated water to the Himba tribe in northern Namibia,\u201d says Spence, who believes the associations we make are largely a matter of experience. \u201cDo they, with no schooling, think also that bitter is angular? And they don\u2019t.\u201d Youssef insists there\u2019s much more to his work than helping big companies make money and providing exotic experiences for the well-heeled. \u201cPeople say, \u2018What the hell does it matter if a red strawberry mousse is rated as being 10-12% sweeter if you put it on a white plate than on a black plate? Who cares outside of some pretentious chef, some pretentious diners?\u2019\u201d he says. But he\u2019s adamant that employing lessons from psychology could allow producers to create healthier foods. Altering the colour of foods and packaging, for example, could enable a reduction in sugar content. \u201cNow we are starting to tackle obesity, diabetes and lots of other health-related issues that come from sugar. So where is the pretension in that?\u201d says Youssef. It\u2019s not such a wild idea. In 2012, Cadbury unveiled its new Dairy Milk bar, its previous hard edges replaced by a curvier configuration. Complaints followed, most of them concerned not with the way it looked but how it tasted. Consumers were convinced it was sweeter, yet Cadbury\u2019s maintained the recipe hadn\u2019t been tinkered with. Spence believes it\u2019s a case in point of shape influencing flavour, and he thinks Cadbury\u2019s missed an opportunity. \u201c[You\u2019d] think there would have been a health opportunity to reduce the amount of sugar \u2013 change the shape and keep the perception in the mind of the consumer exactly the same,\u201d he says. But for Spence and Youssef, a bigger challenge lies in persuading us to try something we believe to be repulsive but might ultimately be beneficial \u2013 such as eating insects and worms as a cheap source of protein. It\u2019s an area Youssef is already starting to explore, presenting guests at the Synaesthesia dinner with sourdough and two types of butter: one salted, the other containing dried worms. Thinking it would be rude not to try, I had gingerly placed a dab on the bread. It tasted like, well, butter \u2013 although the worms added a certain coarseness. As I later confess as much to Youssef he looks triumphant. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to eat insects, but we know they are more sustainable and very high in nutrition,\u201d he enthuses. Fatty, familiar, malleable butter, he believes, is an excellent medium for lulling diners into an adventurous mood. And it seems to be working. \u201cOn the random spot-checks we\u2019ve done, we get more salt butter than worm butter back,\u201d he reveals. Although the appeal isn\u2019t universal. \u201cI have had a guest sit down, look at the menu, get served worm butter, stand up and say, \u2018This isn\u2019t for me.\u2019\u201d Professor Terry Acree of Cornell University believes appeal might simply be a matter of experience and exposure, explaining the attraction of durian fruit despite its pungent odour. \u201cThose are sulphur compounds which are scatological in nature, they are found in poop,\u201d he explains. \u201cThose compounds are very strong and very intense and associated with some pretty bad stuff \u2013 but you adapt to them very quickly.\u201d Other useful applications seem possible, with Spence keen to apply his insights to hospitals, finding ways to tackle the metallic taste of food often experienced by cancer patients, or make medication more appealing by experimenting with fake capsules produced in the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bitter tasting pill \u2013 but from that we can see which shapes and colours and combinations and what names [to use],\u201d he explains. Spence even envisages harnessing multisensory stimuli to help those with Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cWe are thinking about olfactory alarm clocks that release the scent of meals three times a day to remind them to eat,\u201d he explains. And with an ageing population, employing all of our senses to bolster our experience of flavour could make getting older more palatable, too. \u201cYou\u2019ve got hearing aids and glasses for the other senses but nothing for smell,\u201d Spence points out. But if teasing apart the factors that influence flavour is one challenge, reassembling them into a truly remarkable dining experience is quite another. In one attempt, exploring Nordic cuisine, Youssef exposed diners to birdsong and rustling trees, scenes from Scandinavia and the scent of wet earth while they ate a nature-inspired dish \u2013 a fusion, he says, that bolstered diners\u2019 memories of the food itself by employing all the senses. Indeed, Youssef believes embracing our multiple senses could offer a new recipe for success. \u201cAs a chef, when you look at your senses you think of them as individual parts and the dining experience as the sum of the parts,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat you never think is one plus one equals three.\u201d kitchen-theory.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/china-admonishes-malcolm-turnbull-on-south-china-sea-comments", "publicationDate": "2015-09-23T03:14:18Z", "tags": ["Asia Pacific", "China", "Malcolm Turnbull", "Australian politics", "Philippines", "Australia news"], "sentences": ["On Tuesday the Philippine president, Benigno Aquino, rejected China\u2019s calls for a bilateral dialogue, saying that any talks should involve other countries that claim parts of the area such as Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan.", "China, Vietnam and Taiwan claim all 200 or so of the Spratlys land features in the South China Sea, while Brunei, the Philippines and Malaysia claim parts of them."], "title": "China admonishes Malcolm Turnbull on South China Sea comments", "article": "China has ticked off Malcolm Turnbull over his comments on the South China Sea, saying Australia should maintain a neutral position over the contested area. \u201cWe hope that Australia will stay committed to not taking sides on issues concerning disputes over sovereignty,\u201d foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters in Beijing.

That is a crucial lesson from history; a lesson that intelligent people in every age keep failing to learn.  On Thursday, a group of people who call themselves Ecomodernists launch their manifesto in the UK. The media loves them, not least because some of what they say chimes with dominant political and economic narratives. So you will doubtless be hearing a lot about them.  Their treatises are worth reading. In some important respects they are either right or at least wrong in an interesting way. In other respects \u2026 well, I will come to that in a moment. With the help of science, technology and development, they maintain, human impacts on the natural world can be decoupled from economic activity. People can \u201cincrease their standard of living while doing less damage to the environment.\u201d By intensifying our impacts in some places, other places can be spared. Through reduced population growth, the saturation of demand among prosperous consumers and improved technological efficiency, we can become both rich and green. There seems to be some evidence that such transitions could be taking place. In the UK, for example, Chris Goodall, drawing on government figures for raw material consumption, has proposed that we might have reached \u201cpeak stuff\u201d. Despite the resumption of economic growth, we appear to be using fewer material goods. I don\u2019t dismiss the possibility that this represents a real transition. But in the same period (2000 \u2013 2012), incomes have stagnated while the cost of rents and mortgages has rocketed. Perhaps we simply have less spare money than we had before. If so, we can expect the shift to last for only as long as extreme inequality and an economy dominated by rentiers persist. To judge by the way things are going, this might be quite a long time. And even if it is correct, can the living world weather this trajectory? If, as the manifesto anticipates, all the world\u2019s people follow this presumed curve \u2013 their consumption rising until it matches ours, before it peaks and falls \u2013 the load imposed on the planet\u2019s living systems before the expected transition occurs is likely to be horrendous. So far, so interesting. In these respects ecomodernism is challenging, provocative and a useful part of the cut and thrust of environmental debate. But then this polite (if utopian) vision takes a dramatic swerve. It\u2019s not just that economic activity should be decoupled from human impacts. Human beings should be decoupled from the land, through a massive and rapid urbanisation. Of course, such processes are happening anyway, but the ecomodernists make it clear that they would wish away almost the entire rural population of the developing world. The US trajectory is the ideal to which they aspire: \u201cRoughly half the US population worked the land in 1880. Today, less than 2 percent does.\u201d This hope appears to be informed by a crashing misconception. The ecomodernists talk of \u201cunproductive, small-scale farming\u201d and claim that \u201curbanisation and agricultural intensification go hand in hand.\u201d In other words, they appear to believe that smallholders, working the land in large numbers, produce lower yields than large farms. But since Amartya Sen\u2019s groundbreaking work in 1962, hundreds of papers in the academic literature demonstrate the opposite: that there is an inverse relationship between the size of farms and the crops they produce. The smaller they are, on average, the greater the yield per hectare. The most likely reason appears to be that small farmers and their families apply a lot more labour per hectare than large farmers do. The ecomodernists seem to have confused low labour productivity with low land productivity; a major and highly consequential mistake. From the ecological point of view, the metric that counts is land productivity: the less land you require to produce a given quantity of crops, the better. In areas with little work, low labour productivity isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing either, as it ensures that large numbers of people are employed, even though the pay is often very poor. So what happens to those who were working in \u201cunproductive, small-scale farming\u201d? The manifesto prescribes the following:  \u201cA growing manufacturing base has long been a crucial way to integrate a large, low skilled population into the formal economy, and increase labour productivity. To grow more food on less land, farming becomes mechanised, relieving agricultural workers of a lifetime of hard physical labour.\u201d   Former smallholders, in other words, having left the land, will find employment in the formal economy, in urban jobs created by others. But it seldom works like this. The economic miracles in South Korea, Taiwan, Japan and (with a long delay caused by Mao\u2019s Great Leap Backwards) China were built on the back of land reform, that distributed land formerly owned by a tiny elite to a much wider proportion of the population. In these nations, people used the money they made from farming to diversify into small-scale industry. Their economic transformation was not handed down from on high but built up from below.  In many other parts of the developing world, rural depopulation has resulted not in a smooth transition to the formal urban economy, but in a highly precarious existence on the economic margins, and a reliance on the informal economy, much of which remains connected to family businesses in the countryside. What the economodernists describe as \u201crelieving agricultural workers of a lifetime of hard physical labour\u201d is experienced by millions as underemployment and desperate insecurity. For all its talk of \u201cthe liberal principles of democracy, tolerance, and pluralism\u201d, the ecomodernist agenda resonates with a long history of such proposals, from the enclosures in England and the Highland clearances in Scotland, the colonial seizures of land in Kenya and Rhodesia, the Soviet dispossessions and the villagisation in Ethiopia to the current theft of farmland in poor nations by sovereign wealth funds and the rich world\u2019s financiers. The ecomodernists are intelligent people, who have a good grasp of technology and certain fields of science, but their apparent ignorance of all that went before and all that lies beyond disturbs me. The poor of the world have long been subject to remote and confident generalisations by intellectuals of this stamp, and have suffered gravely as a result. Nor does their claim that mass urbanisation reduces our assault on the natural world necessarily hold up. The manifesto maintains that:  \u201cCities both drive and symbolise the decoupling of humanity from nature, performing far better than rural economies in providing efficiently for material needs while reducing environmental impacts.\u201d  A recent paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that in the megacities now swelling across much of the developing world, consumption appears to be higher than average. The 7% of the world\u2019s population living in these places consumes 9% of its electricity and 10% of its petrol and produces nearly 13% of the world\u2019s waste. As Mark Bessoudo notes in the magazine Sustainable Building and Design:   \u201cIt turns out that while density does equal efficiency, \u201cmegacity\u201d does not necessarily equal density. Megacities do encompass those places that we typically associate with dense and culturally vibrant urban centres: New York City, Tokyo, London. But what\u2019s not often taken into account is the fact that to keep them running, these cities also require surrounding areas such as industrial lands, ports, suburbs. In other words, the environmental benefits of a city\u2019s dense urban core can be outweighed by the resource-inefficient, yet essential, areas on its periphery. They are, in fact, two sides of the same coin.\u201d   It also seems pretty clear that the richer and more urbanised nations become, the less their people care about their environmental impact. The annual Greendex survey shows the people of the poorer nations consistently displaying greater concern about the impacts of their consumption, even though they tend to consume far less than the people of the rich nations.

Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    A recent YouGov survey reveals that the people of China, Malaysia and Thailand are much less likely to deny the need for action on climate change than the people of the US, UK, Norway, Finland, Sweden and Germany. But the problem with ecomodernism runs deeper than this. There is no attempt in the manifesto to interrogate the concept of modernisation, to determine what it means and what it doesn\u2019t, to examine its problems as well as the benefits it delivers. Instead there appears to be a crude and unexplored assumption that people working in the formal, urban economy are modern, while those on the outside are not. As Oscar Wilde warned, \u201cnothing is so dangerous as being too modern; one is apt to grow old fashioned quite suddenly\u201d. Their conception of modernisation and modernity is, essentially, a 19th century construct: people like us are modern; people like them are not. Modern is good, unmodern is bad, so they need to be more like us, and we can show them how.  The closest thing to a definition of modernism they offer is this:   \u201cThe long-term evolution of social, economic, political, and technological arrangements in human societies toward vastly improved material well-being, public health, resource productivity, economic integration, shared infrastructure, and personal freedom.\u201d   Which would all be wonderful, but unfortunately bears little relationship to the real impacts of the processes they wish to accelerate. As Chris Smaje argues, in one of the most interesting essays I have read this year, published on the Dark Mountain website, \u201cmodernisation\u201d of the kind they celebrate may have liberated many people from bondage, oppression and hard labour, but it has also subjected many to the same forces.  \u201cA word you won\u2019t find in the Ecomodernist Manifesto is inequality. ... There is no sense that processes of modernisation cause any poverty. ... There\u2019s nothing on uneven development, historical cores and peripheries, proletarianisation, colonial land appropriation and the implications of all this for social equality. The ecomodernist solution to poverty is simply more modernisation.  \u201c... From ancient Mesopotamia to modern China the evidence is clear: development implies underdevelopment, material wealth implies material poverty, freedom implies slavery and so on. These couplets are not two ends of a historical process, with modernisation ringing the death knell for the misery of the past, but contradictions within the modernisation process itself.\u201d  His second, devastating essay on the unexamined premises of ecomodernism is also worth reading. Of course we should make the best possible use of science and technology, and assess our environmental options as empirically as we can. Of course we should embrace what is good and useful and progressive about modernity, however that might be defined. Of course we should challenge and contest the wishful thinking that all too often dominates.  In this respect the ecomodernists provide a useful service, provoking us to examine our prejudices. But their generalisations, their ignorance of history, their own unexplored prejudices and an astonishing lack of depth all contribute to a worldview that is, paradoxically, nothing if not old-fashioned.

Debts owed by private households increased by 4.3% on 2013 to total \u20ac35.2tn last year, which means that net financial assets (gross assets minus debt) have topped \u20ac100tn for the first time. Gross financial assets are the combined total of bank deposits, securities, insurance and pension funds. For the first time since the financial crisis, western Europe posted a higher increase in financial assets than North America, with growth rates of 6.7% and 4.8% respectively. This is due to a considerable increase in insurance and pension assets in a number of European countries.

Conversely, most other developed regions have surpassed the totals they were recording before 2008, which the Allianz report says shows to an extent the lingering effect of the euro crisis on savings. The gross financial assets of private households increased by 7.1% on 2013, the third consecutive year that growth has exceeded 7%. If you exclude Japan from the Asian data, the region recorded the fastest-growing financial assets in the world in 2014, with an increase of 16.6% compared with the previous year.  Growth was particularly strong in China, which accounts for nearly 11% of the world\u2019s financial assets, overtaking Japan\u2019s share (8.9%) for the first time.

Kazakhstan has the lowest financial assets per person in the world, among those analysed, with just \u20ac406 for every person resident in the central Asian country \u2013 just 0.26% of the Swiss total.  Are financial assets held equally?  What Allianz terms the world\u2019s wealth lower class makes up 71% (3.5 billion) of the planet\u2019s population but holds less than 5% of net financial assets. While 80% of the world\u2019s net assets are held by the upper wealth class, which makes up less than 10% (420 million) of the population.  The remaining 17% share of financial assets is taken up by the burgeoning global middle class, which has increased its share by 10% since 2000.      Chart: Allianz Global Wealth Report 2015 Photograph: Allianz    Last year, the number that fell into the middle wealth class surpassed 1 billion for the first time. Since 2000, 600 million people who were previously in the low wealth bracket have moved into the middle wealth bracket.  Most of this growth has come from Asia. The middle class in this region contains 855 million people, nearly 10 times more than at the start of the millennium. Asians make up two-thirds of the wealth middle class, with 85% of them from China.  The categories used by Allianz are defined by taking the average global net financial per capita assets (\u20ac20,360), the middle bracket comprises individuals whose assets fall between 30% and 180% of the global average.

Australia pays US$459 each person a day to keep asylum seekers and other migrants in immigration detention, according to a report, There Are Alternatives, launched by the International Detention Coalition in Geneva.       In the US, the figure is US$224 and in Canada US$134. In Europe, now experiencing an unprecedented influx of refugees from the Middle East and central Asia, the figures are similar: Austria pays US$134 a day to detain a person in immigration detention and Belgium pays US$201. The statistics are based on countries\u2019 own government figures. Australia\u2019s detention regime is especially expensive because of the costs of running detention centres in remote places, such as Christmas Island, Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. The cost of building high-security facilities, accommodation for staff, and of flying in workers, food, water and other logistical equipment makes remote detention centres additionally expensive. The total immigration detention regime costs more than A$3.3bn a year. The government\u2019s national commission of audit found last year that it cost more than A$400,000 to keep a single person in offshore detention for a year, more than 10 times the cost of having someone live in the community, which would be less than A$40,000 a year. Onshore detention costs A$239,000 each person a year, and community detention about A$100,000 for each asylum seeker. Transfield\u2019s contract to run Australia\u2019s two offshore processing centres \u2013 in Nauru and Manus Island \u2013 is worth about A$60m a month: A$2m a day for about 1,500 people. The next contract is expected to be cheaper, about A$45m a month, but for longer. It is expected to be signed for a five-year term. The lead author of There Are Alternatives, Dr Robyn Sampson from Swinburne University of Technology, said the IDC report demonstrated there were alternatives to immigration detention that were more effective, cheaper and more humane. \u201cDetention on the basis of immigration status should be a last resort,\u201d Sampson told Guardian Australia. \u201cIn this report we ask, \u2018Well, what are the first, and second and third resorts?\u2019, helping governments to see that there are many different options for alternatives to detention \u2026 that are more effective, more humane, and more cost-effective.\u201d   Related: Gillian Triggs confirms she was asked to resign over children in detention report    The report identifies more than 250 alternatives to detention across more than 60 countries, including supervision orders, telephone and in-person reporting to authorities, directed residence, surrender of travel documents, and living at a nominated address. However, Sampson said more countries were detaining more immigrants, and for more reasons. \u201cThere is a global trend towards the increasing use of detention for reasons of immigration status. States are building more detention capacity, and they are broadening the range and number of people who can be detained.\u201d However, internationally fewer and fewer countries are detaining children for immigration reasons. In 2005 a South African court ruled that children could be detained only as a last resort, and Panama (2008), Japan (2010), Turkey (2014) and Taiwan (2015) have passed laws prohibiting the detention of children. Finland (2010), Malta (2014) and the UK (2010) have all publicly committed to ending child detention. France (2012) and Israel (2014) have limited child detention to \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d and China has restricted it for children under 16.    Detained children have higher rates of suicide, suicide attempts and self-harm  International Detention Coalition     Immigration detention has a \u201cprofound and negative impact\u201d on the health and development of children, the IDC report found. \u201cChildren in detention are at risk of depression and anxiety and frequently exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Detained children have higher rates of suicide, suicide attempts and self-harm, mental disorder and developmental problems.\u201d The UN committee on the rights of the child ruled that detaining a child because of their migration status \u2013 or that of their parents \u2013 was a violation of a child\u2019s rights \u201cand always contravenes the principle of the best interests of the child\u201d. \u201cIn this light, states should expeditiously and completely cease the detention of children on the basis of their immigration status,\u201d the committee said. Australia is one of the few countries in the world to enforce mandatory detention of all irregular arrivals, including children. It introduced mandatory detention under Labor in 1992. It was originally a \u201ctemporary and exceptional\u201d measure designed to cope with an influx of asylum seekers from IndoChina and was limited to a maximum detention period of 273 days. That limit was abandoned in 1994. The number of children in detention in Australia has decreased dramatically, from 1,992 in July 2013 to 197 (104 in Australia and 93 on Nauru), but children are spending longer in detention than previously. The average time for a person in immigration detention is 412 days. The Australian Human Rights Commission report The Forgotten Children called for all children and their families in immigration detention to be released into the community. The government has consistently trumpeted the success of its border protection policies which, it says, have \u201cstopped the boats\u201d and prevented drownings.   Related: Peter Dutton holds 'productive' talks in Cambodia over refugee resettlement    \u201cWe remain as committed as ever to implementing tough policies that stop vulnerable people being exploited by criminals, prevent further loss of life at sea and ultimately keep people smugglers out of business,\u201d the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said this week. \u201cIt remains Australia\u2019s policy to safely turn back boats or send people to another country for processing and resettlement, regardless of where they are from.\u201d Dutton said the fundamental pillars of Australia\u2019s border protection regime would not change. No consideration was being given to ending mandatory detention. \u201cThe government will continue to implement tough measures to protect our borders because it\u2019s very clear that they work.\u201d A spokesman for Dutton said the Coalition government had moved 1,276 people into community detention and issued 7,549 with bridging visas to live in the community, but that processing their asylum claims was expected to last years. The spokesman said the government had worked consistently to remove children from detention. \u201cUnfortunately there are some children who because of security or legal issues surrounding a parent or parents are unlikely to leave detention because that is the wish of those parents. In these cases the government has offered alternatives to detention for children and one parent, but some families have not accepted this.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/oct/02/the-10-best-astronauts-martian-bowie-ripley-2001-gravity", "publicationDate": "2015-10-02T11:00:02Z", "tags": ["Space", "Science", "Film", "Music", "Design", "Books", "Culture"], "sentences": ["All of which presumably helped him over the existential crisis he suffered in the original Toy Story, when he found out that not only was he was a toy, but he\u2019d been made in Taiwan."], "title": "The 10 best astronauts", "article": "1 | Major Tom in David Bowie\u2019s Space Oddity         David Bowie \u2013 Space Oddity video (1969).    Forget Armstrong and Aldrin \u2013 over the years, it\u2019s Bowie\u2019s Major Tom who\u2019s become the presiding deity symbol of the thrills and chills of the manned space programme, going into orbit at the height of moon-mania in 1969 \u2013 a few days before Apollo 11 landed on the moon and a year after the release of the film 2001  (rendering the song\u2019s title both a homage to Kubrick and a nifty copyright side-step). Three years on, the crew of Apollo 13 narrowly escaped the Major\u2019s deep-space drift fate, while two years ago, Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield offered the ultimate zero-gravity karaoke tribute by performing the song on the International Space Station. Given this weight of role-model expectation, it\u2019s little wonder that the Major was later outed as a junkie in Ashes To Ashes. 2 | Ripley in Alien         Alien trailer.    She\u2019s had an eventful afterlife \u2013 surrogate mother and righteous avenger in Aliens, skinhead commando in Alien 3, mutant clone in Alien: Resurrection \u2013 but Sigourney Weaver\u2019s Ellen Ripley first appeared as a warrant officer among the crew of the Nostromo in the original old-dark-house-in-space thriller, and her chutzpah when faced with more-than-trifling adversity (detonating stomachs, disembowelled androids, wandering felines, oh, and the murderous designs of slithering, slavering, biomechanical killing machines) has led to her being anointed the fifth-coolest hero in pop culture by Entertainment Weekly. 3 | Dave Bowman in 2001: A Space Odyssey         2001: A Space Odyssey - trailer.    Among the really big questions this film continues to throw up (could walking upside down really slowly in Velcro-soled shoes really have seemed the height of futuristic vision, even in 1969? is that really Leonard Rossiter playing a Russian in a grey suit? Why didn\u2019t they just turn HAL off and turn him on again?), the biggest, of course, is: just what kind of space-drug must Dr David Bowman have taken in order to disappear down the kaleidoscopic worm-hole, spend an eternity in a neoclassical bedroom, and be reborn as a star-child with the secrets of the universe at his fingertips? And could Voyager or whoever bring a little of it back, just for strictly controlled laboratory research purposes of course? 4 | Nikolai Cherukin\u2019s cosmonauts poster     Happy New Year Kids!, Nikolai Charukin, 1964.

Charukin\u2019s poster, which can be seen in the Science Museum\u2019s current Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age exhibition, shows a pair of adorable socialist-realist moptops carrying a stylised Vostok launcher above the legend: \u201cHappy New Year, Kids!\u201d It was created just after Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman in space. She revealed at the museum opening that not only was her spacecraft programmed to ascend but not descend, but she was also sent into orbit with toothpaste but no toothbrush. 5 | Robert Rauschenberg\u2019s Retroactive     Retroactive I, 1963.

A year later he was dead, and Rauschenberg, the primary collagist of the US, reassembled the silkscreen he\u2019d been working on to create an elegiac image of Kennedy surrounded by, among other things, an astronaut floating serenely from a parachute, perhaps standing in, as the critic Andrew Graham-Dixon argued, for \u201can angel attending at the Lord\u2019s ascension\u201d. 6 | Buzz Lightyear         Toy Story 2 - Buzz Lightyear opening scene.

So it\u2019s only fitting that Buzz became the longest-serving toy in space in 2008 after six months on the International Space Station where he presided at dinner with its denizens and was seen gazing soulfully through a window into that very same infinite. All of which presumably helped him over the existential crisis he suffered in the original Toy Story, when he found out that not only was he was a toy, but he\u2019d been made in Taiwan. 7 | Laika, Belka and Strelka memorabilia in the collection of Martin Parr     Desk clock with Laika and planets.

Not so much a space opera as a space pile-up, Gravity is not just a study of Murphy\u2019s Law in extremis, but also, according to Father Robert Barron in the Catholic Register, a parable of how \u201ctechnology... can\u2019t save us\u201d; he goes on to invoke the triumph of God over applied science as emblazoned in the form of \u201cthe Ganges in the sun \u2026 the statue of Buddah,\u201d if not the star of Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous. 9 | Barbarella         Barbarella - trailer.

I have, I say, though later I Google it to get the facts straight.  It\u2019s attributed to Joseph Kennedy, paterfamilias of the Kennedy clan who, in 1929, was getting his shoes shined by a young boy who was also making confident predictions about which stocks would rise. For Kennedy, it was a moment of revelation. He sold his portfolio. Not long afterwards, Wall Street crashed and the world was plunged into the greatest depression ever seen. So a tip from the shoeshine boy is a sign that the bubble is about to burst. That the wave of confidence will finally crash upon the shore. That the jig is up.  Pallot used to be the digital editorial director of Cond\u00e9 Nast in New York and now he has a startup. But then, we\u2019re at the world\u2019s biggest startup conference in San Francisco, a few miles down the road from Silicon Valley where the world\u2019s greatest concentration of technology startups first started up.  His company is in the booming field of VR, or virtual reality, which is to 2015 roughly what Rubik\u2019s Cubes were to 1982, though with rather bigger potential consequences. Pallot claims it\u2019s the logical next step for journalistic content. In 20 years\u2019 time, you won\u2019t be reading this on the page, I\u2019ll probably be leading you by the hand through a 3D rendering of a virtual TechCrunch conference floor. Or, more likely, you\u2019ll be leading yourself and I\u2019ll be claiming jobseeker\u2019s allowance. But anyway. In the meantime, Pallot asks me if I\u2019ve heard of the tip from the shoeshine boy. I have, I say, and tell him it\u2019s been on my mind. Because for three days, I\u2019ve been hearing about \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2013 a Silicon Valley term for companies that have been valued at more than $1bn. When this usage was first coined, less than two years ago, there were 39 of them. Today, there are 147. Or as Matthew Wong, a senior analyst at CB Insights, tells me: \u201cThe funding is at levels that we haven\u2019t seen since 2000.\u201d As those with longer memories will recall, that was the year the dotcom bubble burst. It needs explaining because there are an awful lot of people at TechCrunch whose memories simply don\u2019t go back that far: the typical startup founder is male and in his 20s. Back in 2000, Google was less than 18 months old and Facebook wasn\u2019t even a glimmer in Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s eye \u2013 he was still at high school. (At 31, he\u2019s now practically Silicon Valley\u2019s elder statesman.)   Related: Five lessons Silicon Valley has for UK tech entrepreneurs    Everything has changed. And is changing at an ever-faster pace. Eight years ago, TechCrunch launched its Disrupt conference with 45 startups. This year, there are 5,000 of them. Over three days I talk to founders of companies from San Francisco and Texas and Uruguay and Beirut and Stockholm and Tel Aviv and Warsaw. There are apps for crowdfunded mortgages and cheaper divorces and better sex. There\u2019s \u201cExpedia for golf\u201d and \u201cFacebook for cars\u201d and \u201cNest for water\u201d and \u201cTinder for dogs\u201d. There\u2019s a virtual reality teddy bear, a device that claims it will be able to read your emotions via a contact lens in your eye and another that will automate your home cannabis farm (marijuana is a big deal in Silicon Valley right now). I miss the panel on nuclear fusion startups but they\u2019re around.  They\u2019ve all paid upwards of $3,000 (\u00a31,900) to be here and they\u2019re all trying to attract the attention of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest beasts. The VCs \u2013 venture capitalists to you and me. The money guys.  \u201cHow do you spot them?\u201d I ask Peter Becronis, the founder of a real estate startup called Owner\u2019s Vault. \u201cOh, it\u2019s easy,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re all men, older guys who are in jeans and brown boots and perhaps a blue jacket. Oh, and a good watch. They\u2019re the ones who shuffle past you trying not to catch your eye.\u201d It\u2019s a long shot for the likes of Becronis to be here, but not a total pipe dream. Because hundreds of startups are being funded each month. Vast sums of money are changing hands. Crunchbase, TechCrunch\u2019s sister site, lists the deals that are being done on a daily basis. On the day I write this, I check it and find 24 companies that have just received funding, including Kreditech, which got $92m (it uses \u201cbig data and complex machine-learning algorithms to credit score everyone worldwide\u201d) and Medium, which received $57m (it\u2019s a platform that has found another new business model that seems to involve not paying journalists). Every month the amount of money being invested in early-stage startups goes up. And every month, more and more people are starting to use the B-word. Bubble. The last time this amount of money was swilling around, we know how it ended. \u201cBack then, a lot of websites launched but that\u2019s all they were, websites,\u201d Mike Butcher, TechCrunch\u2019s editor-at-large, tells me. \u201cNow in 2015, all those technologies that were predicted \u2013 AI, drones, VR \u2013 have all turned up. The innovation is real. And it just continues to get bigger and bigger. There are more VC firms here than you can poke a stick at. \u201cIs it a bubble?\u201d he asks and then answers the question himself, vividly, if not entirely clearly. \u201cIt depends. How many unicorns can you fit through the eye of a needle? Anyway, unicorns are over. It\u2019s all about decacorns now. Companies that are worth tens of billions of dollars.\u201d     AOL\u2019s takeover of Time Warner in 2000 was the largest merger in US corporate history at the time. Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/AP    In 2000 the bubble was in publicly listed companies \u2013 organisations like the then upstart AOL, which bought Time Warner for $164bn, the largest merger in America business history, and then most spectacular blow-up. Or in Britain, Lastminute.com, whose share price peaked at 511p before crashing to 80p a month later. Both companies survived, unlike many, but it was a long struggle back up for both of them. (In a neat bit of circularity, AOL bought TechCrunch along the way.) In 2015, it\u2019s private money flowing into companies that may or may not go public one day. The shoeshine boy wouldn\u2019t be tipping stocks in 2015, but what would he be doing? I ask Ned Desmond, the chief operating officer of TechCrunch. He thinks for a moment. \u201cHe would probably be an Uber driver who has his own angel investment line,\u201d he says. But James Pallot tops that. He\u2019s flown in from JFK and had his shoes shined in the airport. \u201cAnd the guy had a startup. I literally got a tip from the shoeshine boy! He was trying to find an investor for his national shoeshine franchise.\u201d But then, in many ways, there has never been a better time to be a startup. Niko Bonatsos, a VC with General Catalyst Partners, tells me that the sheer number of companies at TechCrunch \u201cspeaks volumes about how the barriers to entry have been removed. It\u2019s really easy to start a company. And lots of companies from other parts of the world see this as a lottery ticket. And for some of them, it will be. It\u2019s the survival of the fittest. And the luckiest.\u201d Pallot and his co-founder are currently \u201cbootstrapping\u201d their company, Emblematic Group, which is creating virtual reality news content. \u201cBootstrapping\u201d is Silicon Valley jargon. It means getting by with what you\u2019ve got. It\u2019s how people have set up companies since the dawn of capitalism. You start a business with a bit of money you already have and you try to attract customers and build it from there. \u201cBootstrapping\u201d is how you figure out if there\u2019s a market and, if so, how you reach it. It\u2019s also, like, totally 20th century. The reason 5,000 companies pay $3,000-plus to come to TechCrunch is because Silicon Valley has another model. People \u2013 strangers \u2013 will give you vast sums of cash to build your company into a global brand overnight. If you can deliver the killer pitch. The pitch that convinces the valley\u2019s top VCs that you are the next Facebook, the next Uber, the next Airbnb. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like this in the rest of the world,\u201d Ned Desmond tells me. \u201cIn Indonesia or Turkey or wherever, normal business culture demands collateral and security. Venture investing has none of that. You are investing in potential.\u201d You\u2019re gambling, basically. Silicon Valley, in 2015, is a giant casino. And the bets are so large because the potential payoffs are so huge. The next Google has to start somewhere. So is it a bubble? \u201cEverything is cyclical,\u201d says Desmond. Does he remember the last crash? \u201cI was there! I was in it. It was terrible. We had just launched a magazine, Business 2.0. Even the name sounds so cringeworthy now. We launched in May 2000 with a record number of advertisements. We had 150 ad pages. A year on, we had 15.\u201d This is not exactly an answer, so I try again. Is it a bubble? \u201cWe published a graph showing the unicorns. It\u2019s a hockey stick. It\u2019s near vertical growth.\u201d So, is it a bubble? \u201cSome people say we are living through a period of history that is unprecedented. They say that everything has changed. That it\u2019s different now.\u201d So is it a bubble? \u201cLook,\u201d he says finally. \u201cYou can answer that question for yourself. Look at the graph. It\u2019s just about common sense.\u201d ***** Out on the exhibition floor, it\u2019s mayhem. Everyone is pitching everyone else. And it\u2019s all being conducted at volume 11. Because if you have a big idea and you want to find a VC, it\u2019s just possible that you might find one out there. I lived through the 2000 bubble and subsequent crash vicariously via a flatmate who got a job with a thrusting new website, and it\u2019s probably my imagination, but there\u2019s something of the atmosphere that I remember of the time: loud, overexcited twentysomethings who tended to leave a mess on the floor. A dozen or more countries have bought into the Silicon Valley dream and sponsored their companies to be here: there are pavilions representing Brazil, the Middle East, Uruguay, Taiwan, Norway, the Czech Republic. And the posters above the stands look like they\u2019ve been produced by an automatic startup buzzword generator. \u201cDigital innovation platform!\u201d reads one. \u201cAccelerate growth disruption\u201d another. A third offers to \u201cquantify your coding\u201d. The first person I talk to \u2013 and that\u2019s because he stops me in my tracks by holding an iPhone with a picture of an anchor on it right in my face \u2013 is Lev Moravtchik. He\u2019s a 33-year-old from Israel who has a dating app \u2013 Diggidi \u2013 that he tries to convince me is going to be bigger than Tinder. Is this the dream? To start your own company? \u201cNo, never! Nothing is forcing me to ruin my life.\u201d Is that the fear? That you\u2019re ruining your life? \u201cOf course! Do you know the figures? More than 90% of all startups fail.\u201d So why are you here? \u201cIsrael is a startup nation. And Diggidi is different from anything else. It\u2019s disruptive.\u201d This is TechCrunch Disrupt. Of course it is. But how exactly? \u201cBecause it\u2019s a dating revolution. Because it can\u2019t be ignored.\u201d     The process of \u2018disruption\u2019 is supposed to describe how established firms such as IBM were overtaken by the likes of Microsoft. Photograph: Fabian Bimmer/AP    But then, if there\u2019s one thing that I learn, it\u2019s that disrupting is to now what dropping out and tuning in was to the 1960s. Everyone\u2019s disrupting. Or at least everyone thinks they are. The usage of the term was coined by Clayton Christensen, a professor at Harvard Business School, to describe how even massive, seemingly invincible companies like IBM can be displaced by scrappy little upstarts like (once upon a time) Microsoft. He called it the \u201ctechnology mudslide hypothesis\u201d. Or how some small new technological breakthrough can have huge world-changing consequences. And if I\u2019m not convinced that Diggidi is the revolution the world has been waiting for \u2013 it takes me a good five minutes to understand how the anchor even comes into it \u2013 I also have no idea what revolution the world is waiting for. But then, as Tod Francis, a Silicon Valley VC with the firm Shasta Ventures, tells me, often the world has no idea either. Until it arrives. \u201cIt\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to keep an open mind. Think about what billion-dollar companies looked like at this stage. Most of the really big ideas were easy to dismiss. Nobody thought sleeping on people\u2019s couches was some amazing business plan, but look at Airbnb. Look at FitBit \u2013 did anyone really need that? No, but people bought it. We see crazy ideas in action every day. Often they are the ones that are accepted.\u201d I meet him on the way into the startup \u201cbattlefield\u201d. It\u2019s the heart of TechCrunch, where 25 companies take to the stage and pitch their hearts out to a panel of VCs who make the judges on Dragons\u2019 Den look like kindergarten teachers. It\u2019s a big deal. Dropbox was a battlefield contender, as was Yammer (sold to Microsoft for $1.2bn), and Mint.    Everyone knows it\u2019s a bubble. That doesn\u2019t mean a lot of people won\u2019t make a lot of money. It\u2019s like musical chairs    And it\u2019s incredibly competitive. More than 950 startups applied and yet, to the outsider, it\u2019s hard to quite see how the ones that got through, got through. There\u2019s a company that is looking to change the world through its robotic nail-art machine. There\u2019s a \u201cpersonalised content relevancy platform\u201d. And an app that will deliver food for your kids\u2019 lunchboxes. (You can\u2019t move in Silicon Valley for delivery apps these days. Or, as one tech editor summarised the sector to me, \u201ctwentysomething men who have set up companies to provide things their mother used to do for them.\u201d) The odds are that one of them will be the next unicorn, but I\u2019m having a hard time spotting which, not least because the man sitting next to me is offering his own running commentary. \u201cEasyPaint?\u201d he says, as we watch a presentation for an app that\u2019s going to revolutionise the painting and decorating industry. \u201cEasyDud more like. People will use it once then take the guy\u2019s number and call him directly.\u201d Michael, who doesn\u2019t want his full name in this article, works for a Japanese technology company and is at TechCrunch to make recommendations for early-stage startups that he thinks his company should acquire. He practically guffaws when I ask him if it\u2019s a bubble. \u201cOf course it\u2019s a bubble. Everyone knows it\u2019s a bubble. Which doesn\u2019t mean that a lot of people won\u2019t make a lot of money. It\u2019s like musical chairs. The question is not if it\u2019s a bubble, but will it remain long enough for us to get in on it? The question is: am I too late? \u201cLook at how many companies are cash-negative. Twitter is still cash-negative. Even Uber is cash-negative. Silicon Valley is a hype machine. That\u2019s how it works. And sometimes if there\u2019s enough hype, it pays off. And sometimes it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s like when you go house-hunting and the real estate agent doesn\u2019t say, \u2018Look at how great the space is. Look at how great the area is.\u2019 They say, \u2018If you don\u2019t buy now, it\u2019ll be twice the price in six months\u2019 time.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t reflect true value. It\u2019s just a sort of herd mentality.\u201d And he gives me the example of San Francisco\u2019s first gold rush, the huge influx of money in 1849 that created large swaths of the Victorian city that still stands today. \u201cPeople thought prices would go up and up and up and that eventually they would fill in the bay and build there. People were buying plots of land beneath the ocean because they thought that in the future prices would rise. It\u2019s exactly the same as we\u2019re seeing today.\u201d     Rocketing property prices have caused tension in San Francisco between wealthy tech staff \u2013 who are often driven by bus from downtown areas to their places of work \u2013 and longer-established residents. Photograph: John Orvis/Demotix/Corbis    It\u2019s an apposite example because San Francisco is in the grip of a property boom that makes London\u2019s look almost sane and reasonable by comparison. The average rent on a one-bed apartment has just hit $3,500 (\u00a32,300) a month, and that\u2019s if you can find one. The entire city is pinched. I can\u2019t find a single hotel room for under $350 and so rent a room in someone\u2019s house via Airbnb, and even that is $150 a night. The founders of a Parisian startup, Aircall, tell me they\u2019ve come to look for funding. \u201cWe are four guys so we thought, OK, we will share an apartment and it is $10,000 a month! We were like, wow!\u201d They still came though. \u201cBut we left the tech team in France. Europe is like the third world to Silicon Valley now.\u201d Mike Butcher tells me that \u201cSilicon Valley isn\u2019t a place any more. It\u2019s a state of mind. You can be in Ukraine or Berlin or wherever.\u201d You can. But if you want to be where the money is, you still want to be here. And it\u2019s here in San Francisco that the tectonics of the tech industry are smashing up against those of the real world, a San Andreas-sized faultline rumbling deep beneath the ground. \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d used to be a chain of dormitory towns a commuter train ride away from San Francisco where the likes of Google and Apple have their campuses. But increasingly, it\u2019s moving to San Francisco itself. Everyone wants to be downtown, where the bars and hipster cafes are. But the more attractive the city becomes to startups, the more cripplingly expensive it is for everyone else. The city that gave birth to the counterculture, that stuck it to the Man, that is still home to organic co-ops and vegan co-living spaces, is right in the path of the Great Disruption \u2013 a storm whipped up and driven by the most relentless form of capitalism ever witnessed. Tim Fernando, 31-year-old co-founder of an Oxford-based startup, Esplorio, explains why they\u2019re staying in Oxford. \u201cA software engineer will [cost us] $120,000 here, whereas in Oxford, it\u2019s more like \u00a326,000.\u201d And yet, it\u2019s hard to ignore the benefits that just being here confers. \u201cWe\u2019d literally just arrived and were sitting in a coffee shop and it turned out that the woman sitting opposite us was a director of marketing at Apple. That kind of thing just doesn\u2019t happen in Britain.\u201d I rather like Esplorio. It uses data from your phone to create an automated travelogue of where you\u2019ve been, and they tell me they\u2019ve had $300,000 in early-stage funding. \u201cWell done, I say. \u201cThat\u2019s sounds like a lot.\u201d \u201cDoes it?\u201d says Fernando and he sounds slightly mournful. \u201cNot in Silicon Valley terms it\u2019s not.\u201d And it\u2019s true, it\u2019s not. And it\u2019s as useful a measure as any of how Silicon Valley has parted ways with reality. Or at least the reality that most of us know; a world where $300,000 remains quite a lot of money. Silicon Valley, on the other hand, is a place where billion-dollar companies are being created almost overnight. Six years ago, Uber didn\u2019t exist. In its last round of funding, it raised $1bn in capital from private investors, giving it a supposed value of $50bn. It\u2019s a penta-decacorn. Less a mythical creature, some might argue, more a Frankenstein monster. But Silicon Valley\u2019s primacy remains indisputable. \u201cLook at how many world-changing technologies have been created within a few miles of here,\u201d Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, tells me. \u201cYou\u2019re using an iPhone, which was invented 25 minutes away. You\u2019re staying in an Airbnb, which was invented five minutes from here. You\u2019re probably using Twitter, which was dreamed up around the corner. It\u2019s incredible how concentrated the real innovation has been. How much has come out of this one area.\u201d Y Combinator is probably the most famous of Silicon Valley\u2019s seed funds. It runs a three-month programme that nurtures startups and eventually helps launch them into the world. Dropbox, Airbnb and Reddit all began life there. \u201cEight thousand companies applied for the last batch,\u201d says Altman. \u201cAnd we have two batches a year.\u201d There\u2019s so much money in Silicon Valley at the moment, he says, because interest rates are so low and \u201cstartups have been one of the few asset classes that have generated real growth\u201d. And the reason there are so many unicorns is that VCs bet big or they go home. He says it doesn\u2019t matter if there\u2019s a bubble or not, good companies will still make it whatever, an argument that echoes Bill Gates\u2019s remarks from last year. He claimed that half the companies being created in Silicon Valley were \u201csilly\u201d and two thirds of them would fail. \u201cBut the dozen or so ideas that emerge out of that are going to be really important.\u201d Already \u201cunicorpses\u201d have started to appear. Groupon\u2019s value is dropping like a stone. It\u2019s being predicted that Dropbox, once valued at $10bn, will be \u201cthe first dead decacorn\u201d. On the TechCrunch stage, people try not to say the \u201cbubble\u201d word. They say there is \u201cfrothiness\u201d. That there is \u201ca lot of capital that is seeking returns\u201d. That \u201cvaluations are a bit robust\u201d. Elsewhere, people are not so restrained. Earlier this year, Bill Gurley, a partner at Benchmark, a big Silicon Valley venture firm, sent out a series of tweets warning of a bubble, including this one: \u201cArguing we aren\u2019t in a bubble because it\u2019s not as bad as 1999 is like saying that Kim Jong-Un is fine because he\u2019s not as bad as Hitler.\u201d    When Airbnb first pitched their idea at me, that you\u2019d stay on an airbed in a stranger\u2019s house, I was not excited  Marcus Hawkins     Out on the exhibition floor, I meet Marcus Hawkins, another Brit. He\u2019s from Norfolk and has successfully run his own software company for a decade or so but he recently set up a new company, Patrolo, a business-to-business enterprise offering a website mistake-correction service. What are you disrupting, I ask him. He thinks for a moment. \u201cKing\u2019s Lynn.\u201d We swap other bits of jargon we\u2019ve picked up. Have you pivoted, I say, a piece of startup-ese I\u2019d learned five minutes earlier. It means to change your business strategy rapidly. \u201cI\u2019ve pivoted so many times I\u2019m practically facing backwards,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s OK. I have a lot of runway left.\u201d Which is the amount of time a startup has before the money runs out, he explains. With the flights and so on, it was a \u00a36,000 gamble to come, he says, \u201cbut I know everyone says this. But what we\u2019re offering is unique.\u201d And unique is what Sam Altman tells me is what investors want. They want unique. Quirky. Crazy. And he cites the Airbnb example that everyone cites, though in fairness he was actually there at the time. \u201cWhen Airbnb first pitched their idea at me, that you\u2019d stay on an airbed in a stranger\u2019s house, I was not excited at all by that. Only halfway through did they develop the idea of renting the whole apartment and then I got excited. If the ideas aren\u2019t crazy enough, the industry is not taking enough risk.\u201d It\u2019s something you\u2019d be hard-pushed to say of some of the startups here. I inspect a smart dog bowl aimed at preventing your dog from overeating, a wristband that will tell a woman precisely when she\u2019s at her most fertile, and a robotic cooking machine that has a lot of parts that look like they\u2019d need washing up.     Even rapper Snoop Dogg is attempting to establish a tech startup \u2013 with the vital ingredient of cannabis. Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images    And any number of cannabis-related businesses. Since marijuana was made legal in four states, the tech industry has rushed into the space. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a marijuana unicorn,\u201d a man from a website called Investing in Cannabis tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s hotter than hot right now. Everyone\u2019s placing their bets.\u201d A point that is proven when Snoop Dogg takes to the stage to announce his cannabis startup, Merry Jane (a lifestyle media site aimed at cannabis users). The inventiveness of the hardware and ingenuity of the software and chutzpah of everyone is quite mind-boggling. There are so many ideas and so much energy and hard work and, more often than not, hard-earned cash being invested in them. If you have come from Bratislava, you\u2019ll have put your own money into the business, a Slovak startup founder called Lukas Alner tells me. \u201cWhereas here, they all graduate from Stanford and Harvard and then go and work in the same places. If they want to make a contact or raise money, they just pick up the phone. It\u2019s very hard to break into that as an outsider. They are pack animals.\u201d    We all love to talk about disruption. But if you are doing something disruptive, people are\u00a0getting hurt  Vinod Khosla     And then there\u2019s the small matter of what it may all mean one day not long from now. Where all this innovation will lead \u2013 a question I contemplate when a founder from Hong Kong called Henry Hu shows me Cafe X, a robotic coffee machine which, he claims, makes perfect artisanal cappuccino. So you\u2019re disrupting baristas? \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cA barista will design the programme which the machine will copy. So, we are extending the skills of talented baristas to a lot more people.\u201d Yadda, yadda, yadda. A Dublin-based startup shows me impressive software that uses \u201cmachine creativity\u201d to create graphic art. \u201cSixty one per cent of the cost of video games is the artwork,\u201d the co-founder, Eric Risser, tells me. \u201cWe\u2019re disrupting that.\u201d So you\u2019re putting artists out of work? \u201cNo, we\u2019re enabling video-games companies to create more and better games.\u201d ***** The truth is, it\u2019s a dog-eat-dog world out there. Disrupt or be disrupted. As Vinod Khosla, a somewhat irascible billionaire and head of a leading venture capital firm reminds the audience: \u201cWe all love to talk about disruption. But if you are doing something disruptive, people are getting hurt. Revolutions are hard on people. People get hurt.\u201d It\u2019s what is forgotten in all of this. If it is a bubble, and if it bursts, the VCs will be OK, of course they will. They\u2019re already rich. It\u2019ll be the little people who will suffer. The 1,100 employees of Groupon who just lost their jobs will be a tiny taste of the pain to come. The ripple of potential consequences vast and as yet unknowable. And if it isn\u2019t a bubble, if the world really has changed, and economic laws too, and everything keeps going up and up and up, it\u2019s still the little people who\u2019ll suffer. The great swaths of us whose services will no longer be required in a coming era that is just around the corner. In the past 18 months, all of us who live in cities around the world have watched as taxi drivers have protested and lost their livelihoods and Uber has swept in and cleaned up, taking 20% of every fare along the way. Don\u2019t think this is going to stop at taxis \u2013 where Uber is going to end up is more or less anyone\u2019s guess. Last month I met the head of Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s robotics faculty, whose entire department has just been poached by the firm. Including him. First they came for the booksellers and I did not speak out because I was not a bookseller. Next they came for the taxi drivers etc etc. Then baristas, divorce lawyers, artists, journalists\u2026 there are not going to be an awful lot of jobs of any description left. How any of us are going to be earning a living in 20 years\u2019 time, in 10 years\u2019 time, is something that most of us aren\u2019t thinking about. In this light, building a startup that has a 90% chance of failure looks like a pretty smart option. \u201cI think there is going to be massive job destruction in the next 10 to 20 years,\u201d says Sam Altman. \u201cI think we are already seeing it. Technology increases wealth but it also concentrates it. There\u2019s a huge coming threat to all of us.\u201d Companies in Silicon Valley think differently from the rest of us. Their ambition is of a different order. Their rate of growth is like nothing we\u2019ve ever seen before. And it\u2019s in San Francisco, where technology meets the real world, that we\u2019re starting to see the beginnings of what this clash of civilisations will look like. Or as Altman puts it: \u201cIf founders in San Francisco can build a new $50bn company in five years but the city can\u2019t approve a single new housing development in that time, that\u2019s a mismatch.\u201d It\u2019s all a mismatch. We and the great tech world we\u2019re building. But then I probably would say that. My industry is just one of hundreds in the throes of the Great Disruption. Yours too, possibly. Even if you haven\u2019t realised it yet. It might not just be startups that need to learn to pivot."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/06/uk-tops-end-of-life-care-index", "publicationDate": "2015-10-06T05:36:19Z", "tags": ["Health", "NHS", "UK news", "Death and dying", "Society"], "sentences": ["Taiwan is the highest Asian country, placing sixth, while India and China rank 67th and 71st respectively."], "title": "UK is the best place in the world to die, according to end-of-life care index", "article": "The UK is the best place in the world in which to die, according to a study comparing end-of-life care in 80 countries. The integration of palliative care into the NHS, a strong hospice movement largely funded by the charitable sector, specialised staff and deep community engagement are among the reasons cited by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).  The upper echelons of the index are dominated by wealthy European, Asia-Pacific and north American countries. Australia is second, New Zealand third and Ireland and Belgium complete the top five. Annie Pannelay, of EIU healthcare, said: \u201cA very strong marker in our index is the availability of specialised palliative care workers and this is where the UK scores particularly well. The UK has a long history of providing treatment in palliative care. The other super strong marker is the way that the countries do have a plan for palliative care. That means they are on the dynamic of measuring progress and improving.\u201d The US is ninth in the index. Taiwan is the highest Asian country, placing sixth, while India and China rank 67th and 71st respectively. Their performances were described as worrying in light of their huge populations, with China of particular concern given that \u201cthe impact of the one-child policy, often leaving individuals caring for two parents and four grandparents, will lead to even more demand for outside resources to provide support\u201d. Among the countries that fare well despite being less wealthy and having less well developed healthcare systems are Mongolia and Panama, 28th and 31st on the index respectively. Mongolia\u2019s performance was attributed to an individual doctor who has driven an increase in palliative care.  Despite the UK\u2019s top ranking, the study\u2019s authors say it is \u201cstill not providing adequate services for every citizen\u201d. They highlight an investigation by the parliamentary and health service ombudsman into complaints about end-of-life care, published in May, which raised issues including poor symptom control, poor communication and planning, failures to respond to the needs of the dying, inadequate out-of-hours services and delays in diagnosis and referrals for treatment. Pannelay said: \u201cThere are some concerns but there is a plan to improve and the single fact that there is a parliamentary report on that and it\u2019s available publicly means a lot \u2013 that means the UK is working on it.\u201d The UK received the top score in the indicator measuring financial burden to patients, indicating that 80% to 100% of end-of-life care services are paid for by sources other than the patient, much of it from charitable funding. The authors praise the Dying Matters Coalition set up by the National Council for Palliative Care charity in the UK to encourage people to talk more openly about death and make plans for the end of life.  The EIU says the UK\u2019s resources, like those of other countries, will be stretched in future by an an ageing population and non-communicable diseases including cancer, dementia and diabetes.  The authors say recent third-party research demonstrates a significant link in the use of palliative care and treatment cost savings. Despite evidence of the economic benefits, they point out that only about 0.2% of the funds awarded for cancer research in the UK in 2010 went to research into palliative care, while in the US it was 1% of the National Cancer Institute\u2019s appropriation. The Quality of Death Index, commissioned by the Lien Foundation, a Singaporean philanthropic organisation, is based on qualitative and quantitative indicators and took in interviews with more than 120 palliative care experts from around the world.  The UK came top in the only previous index, produced in 2010, although that was limited to 40 countries and the criteria has since been refined."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/07/north-korea-recipe-for-success-economic-liberalisation-public-executions", "publicationDate": "2015-10-07T05:05:01Z", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un", "South Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "Germany"], "sentences": ["This model worked very well in Taiwan and South Korea and now is producing impressive results in China and Vietnam."], "title": "Kim Jong-un's recipe for success: private enterprise and public executions", "article": "Kim Jong-un, the third hereditary ruler of North Korea, gets a really bad press. He is widely seen as a capricious, overweight youngster, fond of executing his generals and threatening the world with war; ruler of an impoverished country ever on the brink of famine but equipped with nuclear weapons. There is some truth in this description but it does not represent the whole story. He may have a penchant for executions, but Kim is also the first ruler of the dynasty to implement market-oriented reforms.     North Korea is neither starving nor Stalinist    The oft-repeated cliche of North Korea as a \u201cstarving Stalinist country\u201d is outdated \u2013 it is neither starving nor Stalinist. Experts agree that over the past decade the country has not only recovered from the disastrous famine of the late 1990s, but has also experienced significant economic growth. Pessimists put the annual growth rate at about 1.5%, while the optimists believe it may be close to 4%. This growth was brought about, above all, by the emergence of the private economy. While on paper private entrepreneurial activities remain illegal, the law is seldom, if ever, enforced. As a result some North Koreans \u2013 the more entrepreneurial, lucky, well-connected and ruthless of them \u2013 have recreated the market economy from scratch. Nowadays, there are private mines, truck companies and oil refineries in North Korea.      Pedestrians walk on the newly painted Taedong Bridge in Pyongyang, as North Korea prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of its ruling party.  Photograph: Charles Dharapak/AP    Admittedly, the owner has to register the enterprise as state property, but this fiction misleads nobody. It is estimated that 30-50% of North Korean GDP is now produced by the private sector. The presence of the new rich business people (many of whom are women) is much felt in Pyongyang and other major North Korean cities. They account for the majority of patrons in the upmarket restaurants popping up across the city. Although meals cost $15 to $25, roughly equivalent to the average family\u2019s weekly or fortnightly income, these places are always crowded.    Related: The North Korean women driving economic change    Property prices are going through the roof. A good apartment in Pyongyang costs about $100,000, and the best homes go for $200,000. Over the past 10 years, house prices in North Korea have increased tenfold. Technically, houses cannot be owned privately so people buy and sell \u201cresidence rights\u201d only, but few see this as anything but a convenient legal fiction.    Property prices are going through the roof. A good apartment in Pyongyang costs about $100,000    There is a spillover effect: while rich people buy houses and European cars, more and more ordinary North Koreans can afford meat at weekends and pure rice gruel every day. All these changes began in the late 1990s but the late Kim Jong-il, the father of the current ruler, did not quite know what to make of the growing private economy. Sometimes he initiated crackdowns (always partial and never successful), while other times he grudgingly tolerated the changes. Kim Jong-un is different: he quietly encourages the market economy.     Kim Jong-un inspects a fruit farm: North Korea has enjoyed record harvests in recent years.  Photograph: Rodong Sinmun/EPA    The greatest success of the young dictator has been the reform of agriculture, similar to what the Chinese did in the late 1970s. Fields, while technically state-owned, are given for cultivation to individual households and farmers work for a share of the harvest (30%-70%).  The results of the reforms were predictable: the past few years have seen record-level harvests, and North Korea is now close to self-sufficiency in food production. This year a major drought prompted concern but it now seems that farmers, working not for the party\u2019s glory but for their own gain, managed to fix the problem, and this year\u2019s harvest is going to be high \u2013 perhaps even a record breaker.     Kim Jon-un visits an exhibition. Photograph: KCNA/Reuters    If plans for industrial reforms (decentralisation and partial privatisation of what is left of state industries) are taken into account, the general picture seems clear. Kim Jong-un wants to apply to his country a model of authoritarian capitalism, a so-called \u201cdevelopmental dictatorship\u201d. This model worked very well in Taiwan and South Korea and now is producing impressive results in China and Vietnam. This is good news, and observers should not be surprised that recent polls among refugees from North Korea \u2013 a group not known for their sympathies towards the regime \u2013 indicate that Kim Jong-un is popular with his people.  In China, such changes were accompanied by significant political relaxation. North Korea is different: Kim\u2019s economic reforms, however beneficial, are unlikely to lead to more personal freedoms. If anything, the young leader is more repressive that his father.  North Korea has a problem not faced by China nor Vietnam: the existence of a rich twin state in the south. South Korea\u2019s per capita income is at least 15 times higher, while its population speaks the same language and is officially part of the same nation, which is supposed to eventually, somehow, unify. To put it in context, the per capita gap between the two German states in the 1980s was merely threefold.     Tourists in South Korea look into the North from the border city of Paju. Photograph: Yonhap/AFP/Getty Images    This gap is the reason why the North Korean state has maintained a level of isolation no other communist regime could think of: even ownership of a tuneable radio is a crime. However, a relaxation could mean the populace learning about South Korea\u2019s unbelievable prosperity and doing what East Germans did 25 years ago in a rather similar situation.           Kim Jong-un enjoys himself at a football match in Pyongyang    This threat was well understood by Kim Jong-il, and was the major reason why he did not dare to launch reforms. His son made a different decision, but in order to stay in power he cannot afford any political relaxation, so economic liberalisation is now combined with public executions.  This gives Kim Jong-un the chance to succeed in reforming his country without being overthrown and lynched by a revolutionary mob. Alas, the price for this strategy, which makes perfect sense to the elite, will be paid by common people."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/oct/15/flexible-working-pragmatic-entrepreneurs-employees-productivity", "publicationDate": "2015-10-15T06:20:09Z", "tags": ["Efficiency", "Guardian Small Business Network", "Business", "Small business", "Entrepreneurs", "Money"], "sentences": ["\u201cThat really was extreme remote working,\u201d laughs Mair, \u201cbut he fell in love along the way and has stopped in Taiwan.\u201d Mair says there are major advantages to abolishing the office, including reduced overheads, the ability to recruit globally and having a happier workforce that enjoys flexibility."], "title": "Flexible working is all the rage with pragmatic entrepreneurs", "article": "Workplaces have come a long way over the past decade. The rise of remote working, emergence of cloud-based software and demands for a better work-life balance are driving a new philosophy that shows no signs of abating. Since June last year, all full-time employees that have worked for an employer for more than six months have been entitled by law to request flexible working. But research from campaign group Working Families suggests that more than 90% of employers already offered \u201csome form of flexible working\u201d prior to this law change.  Indeed, flexible hours and remote working are very much in fashion, and a whole sub-industry dedicated to working outside of the office has emerged. The technology industries are most associated with this movement and there are no shortage of advocates among the telecoms, IT, computing and mobile industries.   Entrepreneurs tend to be pragmatic, so would not advocate flexible working unless it made business sense. For many, such as Andy Atalla, founder of digital agency atom42, the growth of cloud computing has been key. The company runs a two-floor office in Camden, but enables staff to work from home when necessary. Atalla says cloud-based software programs are integral to how his business operates, but that there are limits to how flexible the company can be. \u201cClient servicing needs to be done during their working hours so, mostly, we have to match our clients\u2019 hours. Probably the biggest limitation of flexible working is internet speeds,\u201d he adds. \u201cIf you\u2019re on a shared connection in a cafe, you might find your productivity lags.\u201d Business owners are also opting for less conventional ways of maintaining offices. Guy Pattison, CEO of ethical communications agency Long Run Works, operates from two co-working spaces in Brighton and London. Pattison says using the same offices as other businesses has enabled him to meet a wider range of new people. Also, his Brighton space is partly paid for via a quid pro quo arrangement with the company he shares with: 3D printed robots company MakerClub.  \u201cThe biggest benefit to being in a co-working space is networking,\u201d says Pattison. \u201cYou can often stop and have a conversation with someone and say: \u2018what are you working on and what do you need?\u2019\u201d He says this co-working approach is in stark contrast to where he used to work. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in agency land in London, you can find yourself in an echo chamber.\u201d  Clean break: \u2018We ripped up everything we thought we knew about work\u2019 Technology agency Dadi is taking remote-working principles to the extreme. \u201cWhen we started Dadi, we decided to rip up everything we thought we knew about work,\u201d says co-founder Chris Mair. \u201cThe most obvious change for us was getting rid of our office.\u201d Having set up and successfully exited from one business, Mair and co-founders Joe Denne and Will Lebens decided their new business would be structured to fit around their lives, not the other way around.

The storm will intensify this weekend when the presidential candidate of the Kuomintang party (KMT) in elections next year is almost certain to be dumped at a special congress. Hung Hsiu-chu \u2013 known as the \u201cLittle red hot pepper\u201d for her outspoken and impulsive style \u2013 will probably be replaced as candidate by the party chairman, Eric Chu, but that switch, polls suggest, will not prevent a big KMT defeat in 2016, perhaps of landslide proportions.  The manoeuvring over who should stand follows a precipitous decline in the popularity of the KMT since 2012. The immediate causes include a slowing of economic growth, the shrewd tactics of the opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP), the spoiling role of a third party, and the emergence of a new kind of grassroots activism in Taiwan. The consequences could include a worsening of relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China after a DPP victory \u2013 particularly if the KMT loses its majority in parliament as well as the presidency \u2013 and a severe jolt to a system which has allowed two parties with very different inspirations to rub along in a working democracy. The sitting president, Ma Ying-jeou, used a National Day address this month to warn of \u201cturmoil in the Taiwan strait\u201d if a new government, by which he meant one controlled by the independence-leaning DPP, next year mismanages the situation.  That was a reminder that the basic question before voters in Taiwan is not what kind of country they want to become in the future but whether they will still exist as a country, or at least as a unique and separate place, in that future.     Hung Hsiu-chu\u2019s shifting stance on China suggested to many Taiwanese that she saw reunification as a real possibility. Photograph: Wally Santana/AP    Big brother China is always present, watching, reprimanding, warning, and unchangeable in its determination to one day take over Taiwan. That is why there is nowhere in the world where procrastination is a more necessary political art, or nuance such a vital political skill, as in Taiwan. Procrastination puts off the evil day when real decisions have to be made. Nuance allows politicians to obliquely indicate where they stand without venturing black-and-white views which would cost them votes or set off the alarm bells in Beijing. The essence is that politicians steer too close to either the Scylla of reunification or the Charybdis of formal independence at their extreme peril. This is where Hung went wrong, embarking on a redefinition of policies toward China which suggested to many Taiwanese that she saw reunification as a real possibility in the measurable future. This departed from the KMT\u2019s formula of the \u201cthree nos\u201d \u2013 \u201cno to reunification, no to independence, and no to the use of force in the Taiwan straits\u201d \u2013 and it did not go down well with the Taiwanese, whose preference, as repeated polls have shown, is for the status quo. Within a couple of months of being nominated this summer she was 20 points behind her DPP opponent, Tsai Ing-wen, who has smartly avoided being cast as dangerously ready to take up the cause of independence, which is the equivalent no-go area for her. But Hung\u2019s problems were only a detail in an already difficult situation. Ma had initially enjoyed widespread support for his policy of closer economic relations with the mainland. Twenty one agreements on trade and investment have been reached, Taiwanese can now fly from 10 of their cities to 71 in China, and businessmen, students and tourists are flowing back and forth in unprecedented numbers. But Ma\u2019s success rebounded on him. Fears that the growing economic closeness to China could amount to a kind of reunification by stealth grew, particularly among a radical younger generation. American military protection was irrelevant if the real takeover would not be with missiles and tanks but with big business deals. The \u201csunflower movement\u201d demanded the process be halted or subject to close review, going so far as to occupy parliament in 2014. This student and civic society upsurge challenged both parties but was more damaging to the KMT government than the DPP, which was able to co-opt it to a certain extent. The paradox of celebrating better economic relations with Beijing as essential to Taiwan\u2019s prosperity while repudiating them as leading to greater dependence on Beijing reflects Taiwan\u2019s difficult situation. Rightly or wrongly, many Taiwanese worry, says veteran journalist Kuo Chen-lung, of the KMT-leaning United Daily News Group, that \u201cChina is like a black hole \u2026 sucking in everything, including Taiwan\u201d. Taiwan in itself is enough of a balancing act without such additional stresses. At the National Day celebrations this month, most of the varied strands in the island\u2019s history could be observed during the colourful performances of dancers and acrobats. In front of the Teutonic-looking president\u2019s office, built in 1919 to the specifications of a Japanese governor who had studied in Berlin, the modest military parade featured servicemen dressed in American-style uniforms. The dancers included representatives of the island\u2019s aboriginal non-Chinese minority, of the Fukienese, Cantonese, and Hakka migrants from the mainland who took over the lowlands long ago, and of the KMT mainlanders who came in at the end of the second world war. On the dais with the president were the presidential candidates of both major parties. The relationship of those parties remains uneasy. The KMT remains committed in principle to a China in which, as Chiang Kai-shek wrote in his 1943 book, China\u2019s Destiny, the role of Formosa, as Taiwan was then called, was to be a \u201cfortress area\u201d essential to the nation\u2019s security. The DPP represents the interests of native Taiwanese who in spite of their own ethnic differences united in resenting the incursion of mainlanders in1945 when the Japanese colonial administration was replaced by Chiang\u2019s soldiers and administrators. A right-left grid divide overlays these differences with the KMT more big business-oriented, and the DPP more aligned with working people and small business. It has been quite an achievement to make a democracy out of this disparate society.  China has a long record of punishing those who displease it on Taiwan, both the Taiwanese themselves and their remaining friends. Such friendship has got to be kept under the radar, or else. Singapore was cold shouldered for a year after a deputy prime minister made a private visit to Taiwan in 2004. Ahead of the coming elections, Tsai has visited Japan, where it has been reported that she met the Japanese prime minister\u2019s younger brother, and it has been speculated that she also met Shinzo Abe himself. The ambiguity about the meetings is typical of the lengths to which Taiwan has to go to in order to maintain relations with its close neighbours. The DPP has some back-channel contacts with the Chinese, and, contrary to Ma\u2019s warnings last week, Tsai has indicated she supports the status quo under the \u201cpresent constitutional framework\u201d and has no plans to reverse the agreements reached with Beijing during his time in office. But, according to Kuo, the \u201cmanoeuvre room\u201d for the new government next year \u201cis getting smaller and smaller\u201d."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/20/htc-one-a9-an-iphone-for-android-users-who-prefer-open", "publicationDate": "2015-10-20T16:15:14Z", "tags": ["HTC", "Android", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Technology", "Apple", "iPhone", "iPhone 6S"], "sentences": ["The Taiwanese company was the first to build a smartphone with an all-metal body, while its inlayed plastic lines for antenna performance were introduced with the One M8 in 2014.", "This decline recently saw its removal from the Taiwan stock exchange\u2019s blue chip index putting it outside the top 50 biggest companies in its home nation."], "title": "HTC One A9: an iPhone for Android users who prefer 'open'", "article": "HTC has decided that the best way to win in a market dominated by Apple and Samsung is to try and beat Apple at its own game, with the One A9.

As she fires it up, a campy gaggle of would-be mer-people run behind us, singing and dancing their way around the sub-aquatic world that\u2019s slowly taking shape in a warehouse space in an unglamorous corner of New Orleans. Shoals of paper jellyfish catch the breeze above our heads, and in the back a small unit of artists and costumiers are working with a full spectrum of neon and aquamarine shades to add to the seascape. I ask Nichols what\u2019s being constructed on one corner of the yard. \u201cOh, you know,\u201d she says. \u201cA mermaid brothel.\u201d This oceanic panorama is the backdrop to rehearsals for a new show called Splish. Billed as a \u201cMermaid Masque\u201d, the site-specific event will combine a host of creative elements, including cabaret, interactive theatre and live music, as well as newly commissioned art.      The interactive theatre piece is like an underwater version of Sleep No More. Photograph: Sara Brown    Nichols is just one of the creative forces behind the show, which has elements in common with New York\u2019s well-known, immersive theatre experience Sleep No More. I asked her where the idea for this show came from. \u201cI\u2019d been in Taiwan, working on some weird mermaid-themed apartments for a developer,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just somehow evoked this idea of a mermaid brothel.\u201d Nichols developed the idea with some of her long-time collaborators, including the acclaimed New York director Jeff Stark, who has experience of mounting site-responsive productions in unconventional spaces. Mixed-media artists Jade Brandt (a New Orleans local who was American Horror Story\u2019s resident seamstress) and Jesse Roadkill from San Francisco also helped shape the concept.  The group have taken inspiration from the kind of mermaid shows that grew into curiosities and roadside attractions in America: the mermaid rooms at the ill-fated Brookdale Lodge in Santa Cruz, California, for instance, and the famous underwater mermaid theatre at Weeki Wachee in Florida, which thrives to this day.  The queer-tilted world of Splish will include Nina\u2019s squid-lit tank, which will house mermaids of all genders, plus bars and hotel rooms amid fields of seaweed. Audiences will be able to explore these aquatic nooks as the main show unfolds around them. The story is a meld of the cult Paul Verhoeven flop Showgirls with a reverse spin on The Little Mermaid, as new-to-town Polly auditions for a mermaid cabaret called Show and Tail.      Bathing bootys: the script is stuffed with innuendoes. Photograph: Sara Brown    It\u2019s a notably adult production, with ocean-themed innuendo running wild, from dirty talk on \u201cshellphones\u201d to the dangers of catching crabs to a physical discourtesy that\u2019s known simply as a \u201cfishting\u201d. The cast is awash with New Orleans cabaret and drag circuit stars such as Ratty Scurvics and Neon Burgundy, as well as Meschiya Lake, one of the city\u2019s most captivating singers, leading house band the Mermettes.  As the cast take a break, I speak to co-director Zibby Jahns. \u201cFor the past four years I\u2019ve been in New Orleans mounting these large-scale, community-led productions,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s usually been with a view to producing them in a very short amount of time, sometimes within a month from conception to opening night. They\u2019ve mostly been in public, non-traditional spaces.\u201d  This show has taken longer \u2013 around two years of development \u2013 but the ethos is very much the same as Jahn\u2019s previous shows. \u201cThe group all share the same vision, both politically and about what DIY art should look like and what theatre is,\u201d said Jahns. \u201cOur aim is to build a utopia, even if it is built on cliches. We want to transform these eras and locations, and make them how we would have wanted them to be in an ideal world.\u201d      Underwater love: the show harks back to the mermaid extravaganzas of days gone by. Photograph: Sara Brown    Splish is also an exercise in time travel, spanning two decades and whisking the audience through the social turmoil of the 1960s to a hedonistic corner of the 1970s. \u201cWe can transport people within the show to these different times and places,\u201d Jesse Roadkill says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about participation. The more you delve, the more you\u2019ll get out of it.\u201d  The script pokes fun at hot local topics, giving it even more of a site-appropriate feel. Much fun is made of Polly coming from Brooklyn, for instance, a swipe at the rash of New Yorkers taking over the city\u2019s hipper neighbourhoods.  There\u2019s also a much larger idea. In a recent stark report by Climate Central, projections have shown that climate change could see the city of New Orleans under water by the year 2100.  Although this is an obviously serious situation with huge social and economic implications, it wouldn\u2019t be New Orleans without at least a glimmer of gallows humour. Splish, with its lavishly artistic sets populated by fabulous dolphins and the ocean\u2019s seediest mer-verts, evokes a last hurrah \u2013 and who knows, it might even provoke ecological activism positive enough to stop it becoming a reality.   Splish runs at Port in New Orleans, 23-24 October.

But human rights did get one frank airing during Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to the UK after a young British lawyer was filmed politely but firmly confronting a group of Chinese students on the subject. Paul Powlesland\u2019s discussion about human rights and democracy with a group of young Chinese nationals holding banners to welcome their president to London has gone viral after it was filmed and posted on the Facebook page of a Tibet protest group. The 29-year-old civil law barrister has received messages of praise from around the world, with more than half a million people watching the video since it was posted on Wednesday. He has been particularly feted in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and has been interviewed by one Hong Kong newspaper.  Powlesland said he was pleasantly surprised by his unexpected and unsought fame. \u201cIt\u2019s gone quite mad,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019ve been emailed and messaged from people all over the world saying, congratulations, thank you for standing up for human rights and freedom of speech.\u201d Ever since Xi arrived in the UK for his state visit on Monday his presence has been met by huge crowds of Chinese nationals, many bearing identical banners of welcome in a campaign at least in part orchestrated by the country\u2019s diplomats. Powlesland said he was cycling through the City of London on Wednesday afternoon on his way to his chambers after a court case when he saw a crowd of Xi supporters gathered before the president\u2019s arrival at a state banquet. On a whim, Powlesland said, he decided to stop and challenge some of the crowd about China\u2019s human rights record. Unknown to him, a member of the Free Tibet campaign was filming. The video shows him saying to the crowd: \u201cYou\u2019ve come here to express your right, your freedom of speech. Do you think that right should be extended to everyone, all around the world \u2013 in Tibet, in Beijing, everywhere?\u201d The answers are partly inaudible, but one person appears to ask Powlesland about Scotland\u2019s independence. He answers: \u201cThe Scottish people are allowed to vote \u2013 why don\u2019t you give the vote to Tibetan people?\u201d Asked why he is asking such questions, Powlesland replies: \u201cBecause I care about human rights and democracy around the world, for every single human being. Every single one.\u201d  Calling Xi \u201cone of the greatest abusers of human rights in the world\u201d, he adds: \u201cSo many English people are frankly disgusted at the welcome your president has got in our country, that our prime minister will roll over and frankly do everything your president tells him for money.\u201d Powlesland told the Guardian his questions appeared to flummox the students. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really know how to answer them.

In her speech at the Buckingham Palace banquet in Xi\u2019s honour, the Queen noted that the two countries shared the distinction of being permanent members of the UN security council and therefore \u201chave a responsibility to cooperate on these issues which have a direct bearing on the security and prosperity of all our peoples\u201d. In fact, what was striking about the week-long bilateral coupling was the absence of public discussion of the geopolitical crises of the day such as Syria or Ukraine or the South China Sea, where the impasse in the security council has left the international community powerless to respond.  That vacuum would be unthinkable if David Cameron had been meeting any other leader from the security council\u2019s five permanent members. The gold in the promised \u201cgolden decade\u201d is not a metaphor for anything. When it comes to the UK and China it just means cold hard cash.  Cameron\u2019s former chief strategist Steve Hilton derided his former employer for \u201csucking up to China\u201d. He declared the visit \u201cone of the worst national humiliations since we went cap in hand to the IMF in the 70s\u201d.

The public thirst for a debate on the issue was a reflection of its absence from official discussions during the Xi visit. However, these were voices off, kept well away from the main stage. British diplomats have argued privately that there could be indirect strategic benefits of economic interdependence for the UK. Perhaps Britain could eventually exert greater leverage on China, and perhaps, somewhere down the line, it could help peel China away from its tight relationship with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia on some global issues before the security council. There was little in the course of the Xi visit to give credence to such hopes. From start to finish, China showed itself to be the dominant partner in the relationship. That was apparent in the opening moments, when Beijing displayed its mastery of mass mobilisation, filling the Mall with cheering supporters outfitted with flags and banners from the Chinese embassy, swamping out human rights protests that were meagre by comparison. The technique was repeated again and again at each event through the week. In his reply to the one direct question he was obliged to face on human rights, from the BBC, Xi said China had \u201croom for improvement\u201d, but behind the scenes Chinese officials made clear that China had its own view of what human rights meant.           Xi Jinping: China has room for improvement on human rights \u2013 video    \u201cOur goal is to pull 10 million people out of poverty every year, and we have to maintain social stability in order to do that,\u201d a senior official said, adding that if it was necessary to block internet news sites to keep that stability intact, so be it. \u201cThat is the central part of our attempt to achieve human rights.\u201d When Xi officiated at the opening of a Confucius Institute conference in London to promote the teaching of the Mandarin language, the embassy changed the agenda to include the recitation of a poem the president had written in 1990. It was a paean of praise to a traditional Communist hero called Jiao Yulu, a party leader from Henan province celebrated on a million propaganda posters for putting the needs of the ordinary working people before his own. In style and substance, Xi showed himself to be an unreconstructed, old-school party boss. If any leverage resulted from the deals done over the course of the week, it is more likely to be Beijing\u2019s leverage on the UK, through investment in infrastructure and in particular the UK\u2019s nuclear energy sector Justin Harvey, the chief security officer for the US-based Fidelis Cybersecurity consultants, said there was shock in America about the nuclear deal. \u201cYou just don\u2019t mess with nuclear power,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cIn this relationship, China has nothing to lose but the UK has everything to lose.\u201d He said that if current tensions over China\u2019s territorial ambitions in the South China Sea turned into open confrontation, the UK might find itself having to choose between its traditional US ally and a nation that holds significant stakes in its own infrastructure.

But Garfors explains that Eritrea, now nicknamed \u201cAfrica\u2019s North Korea\u201d, wasn\u2019t the hardest country on the continent to access. Angola, also known for human rights abuses, was harder still.  \u201cThey actually refused to return my passport because I made a mistake on the form,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I was following instructions on a website that hadn\u2019t been updated since 2003.\u201d     A lone attraction during Garfors\u2019 short stopover in Angola.

Thanks to his ambitious travels Garfors has become adept at negotiating with passport officials. \u201cI never fill [the forms] out wrong anymore,\u201d he says, before sharing a few other tricks of the trade. He explains that it\u2019s almost always easier to get a visa from a neighbouring country, which is how he got in to Equatorial Guinea. It\u2019s usually cheaper to travel overland, as he did with Turkmenistan, and \u201csometimes its just boils down to getting the right official.\u201d Jogging in North Korea Garfors developed his rules for what constitutes a \u201cproper travelling experience\u201d early on. \u201cI think you need a story to tell, you must have been outside your vehicle or train, or airport,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou also need to have had a conversation,\u201d he adds, lamenting associations like the exclusive Century Travelling Club, for people who\u2019ve been to 100 countries, but which allows its members to count layovers or very brief stops in their official tally. Garfors says that his travelling experiences challenge some common misconceptions about some of the world\u2019s most closed-off states. Getting into North Korea, for example, was not the incredible feat that some might expect, with its small but developed travel and tourism market. However, the regime left Garfors frustrated when he visited in 2009: \u201cI don\u2019t enjoy being told what to do and I don\u2019t like guided tours.\u201d.   Related: How do I get \u2026 to North Korea    He did however manage to organise a run free from his tour guide. \u201cWe got him drunk on liquor the night before,\u201d and the man, hungover, sent the driver to watch over them in his place, Garfors explains.  The driver, not a fitness pro, struggled to keep up with the Norwegian. Running along the Taedong river in Pyongyang, Garfors says he attracted \u201csurprised looks\u201d from locals as he raced solo along the bank.  After all those miles travelled, Garfors almost found lasting love with a girl in neighbouring South Korea, but he explains it didn\u2019t quite work out. \u201cThe funny thing about South Korea is that they take wedding photos months before the wedding, so I have the photos, I\u2019m just not married.\u201d     The official photo from Garfor\u2019s wedding that was never to be.

Over the last two years China has dramatically stepped up land reclamation work on reefs and atolls it claims in the Spratly Island chain in the South China Sea, also claimed by the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei. Chinese ships have been dredging new harbours, while cranes have been erected in an attempt to build artificial islands atop submerged reefs. There is evidence of airstrips being built. The US has protested that the work is illegal and destabilising and for months the Pentagon has been pushing the White House to take a firmer stance.  Washington has said it will ignore any Chinese claim for territorial waters based on new man-made islands, and has flown a surveillance plane with television crews to film the dredging work, sparking bitter Chinese complaints and dark talk in the Chinese press about a coming conflict.  On Tuesday, the US upped the ante once again by deploying a warship to sail through a 12-nautical mile zone around two artificial islands in the archipelago. China responded by accusing the US of \u201cprovocative actions\u201d \u2013 but there was no immediate sign of any military response from Beijing.     High stakes surveillance over the South China Sea. Video: CNN   How did this happen? Control over the South China Sea and its reefs has swung violently over the centuries with the rise and fall of empires, leaving the issue of ownership in the 21st century hazy at best. China\u2019s claims on the Spratlys and the Paracel islands to the north, are based more on historic settlement rather than geographical proximity. As the regime in Beijing has built up its long-distance \u201cblue water\u201d navy it has become increasingly assertive, bolstering its claims with accelerating construction work, and shrugging off calls for a regional negotiation settlement on the Spratlys\u2019 future. The other claimant nations have maintained outposts on the reefs, but China has raised the stakes by seeking to change the geography with significant man-made islands. In May 2015, US officials claimed the Chinese had added 2,000 acres to their outposts in the previous 18 months, much of it since January.  The US has grown increasingly alarmed at Chinese maritime muscle-flexing, combined with the lack of cohesion among America\u2019s allies in the region, and has decided to challenge Beijing\u2019s claims more directly on water and in the air. Tuesday\u2019s freedom of navigation operation near the Spratly archipelago represents the first such mission near territory claimed by China in the South China Sea since 2012. What are the issues? On one level, this is a struggle over natural resources. There are believed to be vast oil and gas fields beneath the sea bed, as well as substantial fisheries. The Spratlys and Paracels also straddle one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping channels. It is also about what kind of world power China is going to be under its president, Xi Jinping, who has an interpretation of China\u2019s global role that puts naval strength at the forefront. In a recently published defence policy doctrine, Beijing puts great emphasis on its burgeoning navy and its mission to \u201csafeguard national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and maintain security and stability along China\u2019s periphery\u201d.     A Chinese military helicopter flies off the deck of a Singaporean frigate during joint exercises in the South China Sea in May.  Photograph: Then Chih Wey/AP    There are legal issues, but China\u2019s standing is weak. Other countries\u2019 have equally strong, if not stronger, historical claims. Beijing is also ignoring the UN Convention on Law of the Sea and dodging multilateral negotiated solutions, preferring to creates \u201cfacts on the sea\u201d. That raises the question of how far Washington is prepared to go in calling China\u2019s bluff. Its decision earlier this year to fly over the Spratlys to film the island-building work was intended to galvanise its allies into concerted action to counter Beijing\u2019s moves, but the states of the region are looking to the US to take the lead in flexing military muscle on their behalf. Tuesday\u2019s naval mission indicated that Barack Obama and Xi Jinping found little common ground during recent talks about the situation in the South China Sea and that Washington now feels it is time to up the ante. Finally, the geopolitical competition is a disaster for a delicate ecosystem of coral reefs and tropical sealife, one of the richest and most diverse in the world. What will China do next? It is unclear how China will respond to the US navy\u2019s foray into what it claims as its territorial waters. Earlier in October China\u2019s foreign ministry said it would \u201cnever allow any country to violate\u201d its interests in the South China Sea. On Tuesday, Beijing said it had warned the US warship to leave the area and accused Washington of launching \u201cprovocative actions\u201d in the region. However, there was little sign of a more robust military response.    Related: South China Sea images reveal impact on coral of Beijing's military bases    Rory Medcalf, a South China Sea expert from the Australian National University, said that by deploying one of its most powerful vessels to the region, the US appeared to have called China\u2019s bluff. \u201cIt looks like Chinese forces have not been given the authority to make that kind of challenge so this will play quite badly for China\u2019s self-made reputation as being determined to face off any American presence,\u201d he said. Medcalf said Xi\u2019s most sensible move now would be to downplay the significance of the US mission in China\u2019s domestic media. \u201cThe more dangerous thing for him would be to express public outrage at the unacceptable US behaviour because that would oblige him to take \u2026 some kind of retaliatory action.\u201d China\u2019s initial reaction \u2013 angry in style but muted in content \u2013 appeared to suggest it would follow that advice. How can I find out more? Some of the most detailed discussion of the South China Sea can be found on the South Sea Conversations website, run by Andrew Chubb an Australian academic. The South China Sea website has a comprehensive set of maps of the conflicting territorial claims. This BBC summary has a concise timeline of events and a useful map of the UNCLOS-based division of the Spratlys, compared with the extent of Chinese territorial claims.

The worry now is that the confrontation will catch fire, escalate and spread. Both China, which claims the Spratlys as its own, and the US, which does not recognise Beijing\u2019s sovereignty, have boxed themselves into a rhetorical and tactical corner. With the Pentagon insisting it will repeat and extend such naval patrols at will, and with the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy determined to stop them, it is feared a head-on collision cannot be far away. China\u2019s heated response to Tuesday\u2019s manoeuvre by the USS Lassen off the Spratlys\u2019 Mischief and Subi reefs, where Beijing is controversially building military airstrips and lighthouses on reclaimed land, left it little wiggle room. The American warship had been tracked and warned off, officials said, adding that what it termed an illegal incursion was a \u201cthreat to national sovereignty\u201d and a deliberate provocation that could backfire.   Related: Beijing summons US ambassador over warship in South China Sea    Anticipating the US move earlier this month, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said: \u201cChina will never allow any country to violate China\u2019s territorial waters and airspace in the South China Sea.\u201d If ever a government has publicly laid down a red line, this is it. And Obama just crossed it. Having personally failed to find a compromise in White House talks with Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, last month, Obama has upped the ante. As is also the case with Xi, it is now all but impossible to envisage an American climbdown without enormous loss of face and prestige. By deploying a powerful warship, by declining to inform China in advance, and by insisting the US is upholding the universal principle of free navigation in international waters and will do so again whenever and wherever it wishes, Obama has deliberately challenged Beijing to do its worst.  Chinese retaliation, when it comes, and it surely must, may not centre specifically on the Spratlys. There are plenty of other potential troublespots and flashpoints where Beijing might seek to give the Americans pause. In prospect is a sort of geopolitical chain reaction. A spokesman, Lu Kang, hinted at this on Tuesday: \u201cChina hopes to use peaceful means to resolve all the disputes, but if China has to make a response then the timing, method and tempo of the response will be made in accordance with China\u2019s wishes and needs.\u201d           Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang warns the US over military moves in South China Sea    China is in dispute over other South China Sea islands and reefs with several countries that are all more or less at one with the US on the issue, including the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia. Renewed trouble could flare up in any of these places. One possibility is the Scarborough Shoal, claimed by Manila, where clashes have continued on and off since 2012. Another obvious pressure point is the Senkaku islands (Diaoyu in Chinese) in the East China Sea, claimed by both Japan and China. In 2013 Beijing upped the ante, unilaterally declaring an air exclusion, or identification, zone in the area, which the US promptly breached with B52 bombers. This dispute forms part of the background to the military buildup ordered by Japan\u2019s hawkish prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who set a record \u00a327bn defence budget this year. (China\u2019s military budget is roughly \u00a390bn; that of the US is about \u00a3378bn).

Japan also strengthened defence and security ties with Britain \u2013 a development that now makes David Cameron\u2019s courtship of Beijing seem all the more incongruous. Taiwan is another powder keg that could be ignited by widening US-China confrontation. While Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and seeks its return, the present-day status quo is underwritten by US military might. Tensions with the mainland have eased under the island\u2019s current president, Ma Ying-jeou. But elections in January are expected to bring the more pro-independence Democratic Progressive party to power. This could provoke Beijing, where Xi has warned his patience is wearing thin.  US-China naval and aerial rivalry could expand even further afield. China is busy building a blue water fleet (a maritime force capable of operating across the deep waters of open oceans) including aircraft carriers, with the aim of challenging US dominance in the eastern Pacific. Chinese naval ships recently showed up off the Aleutian islands during an Obama visit to Alaska, the mineral-rich Arctic being another possible theatre. Meanwhile, regional western allies such as Australia have serious cause for concern that escalating superpower friction could draw them in. If Beijing and Washington cannot find a way of stepping back, cooperation on key international issues such as reviving the global economy, fair and sustainable trade, climate change, terrorism and cybercrime may suffer.

China claims most of the South China Sea, one of the world\u2019s busiest sea lanes, although Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Taiwan have rival claims. Beijing says the islands will have mainly civilian uses as well as undefined defence purposes. But satellite photographs have shown the construction of three military-length airstrips by China in the Spratlys, including one each on Mischief and Subi reefs. Both reefs were submerged at high tide before China began a massive dredging project in 2014. It now claims a 12 nautical mile territorial limit around the artificial islands, although the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea says such limits cannot be set around man-made islands built on previously submerged reefs. Barack Obama said he held \u201ccandid discussions\u201d with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, over the issue during Xi\u2019s recent state visit to the US.

Grimmett might not still capture the public imagination the way Warne does (who would have featured in Grimmett\u2019s pool room mural, do you think? Dame Nellie Melba? Chips Rafferty? Happy Hammond?

Trans-Tasman netball wars When it comes to intense, all-encompassing sporting rivalries, Australia and New Zealand are the Roadrunner and Wile E Coyote of the netball world, though the Kiwis do occasionally win a major tournament so perhaps that\u2019s a little harsh. Of the sport\u2019s 15 World Cups, Australia have won 10 outright, shared another with New Zealand and Trinidad and Tobago; the Silver Ferns also have three trophies of their own. The other nations mostly just make up the numbers. If every world championships pool match is merely a warm-up act for the inevitable Trans-Tasman final, it hasn\u2019t stopped the tournament from producing some of the most thrilling sporting moments between the two nations, none more so than Sharelle McMahon\u2019s last second buzzer-beater in the 1999 decider in Christchurch. It\u2019s a pity we can\u2019t include a single iconic moment from towering New Zealand goal shooter Irene van Dyk (who scores double sports villain points for her early career as a Springbok) here, but McMahon\u2019s wild celebration encapsulated everything great about the rivalry.            Kangaroos-Kiwis rugby league Tests, where football occasionally breaks out International rugby league rivals since 1908, the Kangaroos and the Kiwis have produced some barnstorming footy over the years and plenty of controversy too, from King Wally Lewis steamrolling Darrell Williams to Willie Mason\u2019s ill-advised haka reaction of \u201806, Steve Matai\u2019s big hit on Mark Gasnier in \u201807 and Billy Slater\u2019s infamous 2008 World Cup gaffe that led to Benji Marshall\u2019s winning try for the Kiwis. But no moment between the sides was wilder than Greg Dowling and Kevin Tamati\u2019s fist-flailing display of pugilism when the two nations met in 1985. The referee sin-binned the pair for a brief punch-up that was actually brought under control, but there wasn\u2019t much he could do when the pair resumed hostilities by the Lang Park fence, punching on furiously and delaying play again. The story had a dark undertone, it turned out, with Tamati breaking his silence in 2008 and saying that the fight was sparked by racial abuse he had suffered during the game. Relations between the two sides had never been so toxic.            Trevor Chappell\u2019s underarm ball When Richie Benaud gives you a nationally-broadcasted ticking off, you really know that you\u2019ve taken things too far. So was the case for Australian cricket captain Greg Chappell when he infamously ensured a 1981 one-day international victory over the Kiwis by instructing brother Trevor to bowl the game\u2019s final delivery underarm. If not in direct contravention of the tournament\u2019s rules, it was most assuredly against its spirit. Trans-Tasman relations soured badly in the immediate aftermath, with Kiwi Prime Minister Robert Muldoon calling the Aussies \u201cyellow\u201d and declaring Chappell\u2019s actions \u201cthe most disgusting incident I can recall in the history of cricket\u201d, a title that eventually had a challenger when Mark Richardson and Darren Lehmann raced each other wearing full-body skin suits a few decades later.

Related: China may bring in 'two-child policy' to tackle demographic timebomb    \u201cIf China is serious about respecting human rights, the government should immediately end such invasive and punitive controls over people\u2019s decisions to plan families and have children.\u201d For months there has been speculation that Beijing was preparing to abandon the divisive family planning rule, which was introduced in 1980 because of fears of a population boom. Demographers in and outside China have long warned that its low fertility rate \u2013 which experts say lies somewhere between 1.2 and 1.5 children a woman \u2013 was driving the country towards a demographic crisis. Since 2013, there has been a gradual relaxation of China\u2019s family planning laws that already allowed minority ethnic families and rural couples whose firstborn was a girl to have more than one child. Thursday\u2019s announcement that all couples would be allowed two children caught many experts by surprise.  \u201cI\u2019m shaking to be honest,\u201d said Stuart Gietel-Basten, an University of Oxford demographer who has argued for the end of the one-child policy. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that you have been working on and saying for years and recommending they should do something and it finally happened. It\u2019s just a bit of a shock.\u201d   Related: China's one-child policy: the only child's view - in pictures    The Communist party credits the policy with preventing 400m births, thus contributing to China\u2019s dramatic economic takeoff since the 1980s. But the human toll has been immense, with forced sterilisations, infanticide and sex-selective abortions that have caused a dramatic gender imbalance that means millions of men will never find female partners. \u201cThe gender imbalance is going to be a very major problem,\u201d warned Steve Tsang, a professor of contemporary Chinese studies at the University of Nottingham. \u201cWe are talking about between 20 million and 30 million young men who are not going to be able to find a wife. That creates social problems and that creates a huge number of people who are frustrated.\u201d History showed that countries with a very large number of unmarried men of military age were more likely to pursue aggressive, militarist foreign policy initiatives, Tsang said. In one of the most shocking recent cases of human rights abuses related to the once-child policy, a woman who was seven months pregnant was abducted by family planning officials in Shaanxi province in 2012 and forced to have an abortion. Opponents say the policy has created a demographic \u201ctimebomb\u201d, with China\u2019s 1.3 billion-strong population ageing rapidly, and the country\u2019s labour pool shrinking. The UN estimates that by 2050 China will have about 440 millionpeople over 60. The working-age population \u2013 those between 15 and 59 \u2013 fell by 3.71 million last year, a trend that is expected to continue.    From a political, pragmatic perspective, loosening the policy is good for the party  Stuart Gietel-Basten, demographer     There were no immediate details on how or when China\u2019s new \u201ctwo-child policy\u201d would be implemented. But Gietel-Basten said the policy change was good news for both China\u2019s people and its leaders, who stood to gain from ending a highly unpopular rule. \u201cFrom a political, pragmatic perspective, loosening the policy is good for the party but also it is a good thing for individual couples who want to have that second child. It is a kind of win-win for everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cMillions of ordinary Chinese couples will be allowed to have a second child if they want to \u2013 this is clearly a very positive thing.\u201d Experts said the relaxation of family planning rules is unlikely to have a lasting demographic impact, particularly in urban areas where couples were now reluctant to have two children because of the high cost.  \u201cJust because the government says you can have another child, it doesn\u2019t mean the people will immediately follow,\u201d said Liang Zhongtang, a demographer at the Shanghai Academy of Social Science. Gietel-Basten said: \u201cIn the short term, probably there will be a little baby boom particularly in some of the poorer provinces where the rules have been very strict, like in Sichuan or in parts of the south. But in the long term I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to make an enormous amount of difference.\u201d Dai Qing, a Chinese writer who has publicly called for all family planning rules to be scrapped, said the announcement was a positive step. \u201cIt shows that the authorities have understood the changes in the total population and the demographic structure and started to address them,\u201d she said. But Dai said questions remained, particularly about how Beijing would enforce its new two-child policy. \u201cEven if people are allowed to have two children, what if they want to have three children or more? What if unmarried women want to have their own children? At the end of the day, it\u2019s about women\u2019s reproductive rights and freedoms.\u201d    They should abolish the family planning system. Only that way can they straighten out their relationship with the people  Liang Zhongtang, demographer     Others expressed concern that the announcement of the new two-child policy, which referred to Chinese couples, suggested children born outside of wedlock would continue to be penalised by the government. Liang called on the Communist party to completely dismantle its unpopular and outdated family planning rules.  \u201cI think they should abolish the family planning [system] once for all and let people decide how many children they want to have. Only that way can they straighten out their relationship with the people.\u201d But Gietel-Basten said it would have been virtually unthinkable for Beijing to completely abandon its family planning rules. \u201cThat would in some ways imply that the policy was wrong \u2026 which of course would be a smack in the face of the last two generations of policymakers who stuck by it,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting rid of it completely probably wasn\u2019t an option in the short term. But in the long term it\u2019s certainly not inconceivable that they would move towards a pronatalist policy at some point, maybe over the next five or 10 years, and that they would develop policies similar to in Korea or in Taiwan, or in Hong Kong or in Singapore, where there would be incentives for couples with one child to have a second child.

Related: South China Sea: Beijing 'not frightened to fight a war' after US move    When they met for a summit in California in 2013, President Xi Jinping told Barack Obama that the Pacific was big enough to accommodate both China and the United States. True enough, but what the Chinese leader meant was that the US should move to a sphere of influence on the other side of the ocean from the eastern shores of the People\u2019s Republic. Instead, an American fleet much more powerful than any armed force China can deploy is based in Okinawa in Japan while an \u201cisland chain\u201d linked to Washington runs from there down through Taiwan to the Philippines, which is a US treaty ally. Off to the north-west, South Korea is another ally, with 28,000 American troops stationed on its territory. Forty years after the end of their war, relations between Vietnam and the US have warmed and Hanoi has been alarmed by China\u2019s claims in waters it regards as its own. Other countries in south-east Asia welcome the strategic umbrella of American military power even as they seek to boost economic relations with China. In those circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the People\u2019s Republic feels hemmed in and is putting the development of its navy at the core of its military build-up. Strategic planners in Beijing talk of cold-war-style containment. Building on reefs that it says are sovereign territory on the basis of a map drawn up in 1947, China has steadily pushed its claims to most of the South China Sea, which is a vital trade route as well as a rich fishing ground and, perhaps, home to important energy reserves. The Chinese say these new \u201csandcastles\u201d are there to provide safe landings for fishing vessels that get into trouble, but they have obvious military potential.    During the years of its explosive economic growth, China was happy to see America playing the regional security role    That poses a challenge to other states with claims to the same area, notably Vietnam and the Philippines. But it also impinges on freedom of navigation, since China insists that its writ runs round the islands it has created. The US says its decision to send a destroyer close to one of these islands this week, through waters over which China claims sovereignty, was to assert freedom of international passage. The move was carefully planned, and the measured response from Beijing shows that neither side wants an escalating crisis, but this cannot hide a deeper conflict. On the one hand, Beijing is likely to continue to project itself in the region; on the other, Washington wants to perpetuate its post-1945 role as the main strategic power in east Asia, an area that lacks an overarching security system that could resolve such differences. During the years of its explosive economic growth China was happy to see America playing the regional security role while it concentrated on building up its exports and followed the advice of the paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, to \u201chide its strength and bide its time\u201d. Now President Xi thinks the time has come. As the most powerful hands-on leader since Mao Zedong, he is fashioning a new foreign policy that seeks to project China\u2019s power and presence, first of all in the region, but also globally, as evident from his recent visit to Britain. That worries Washington, where the State, Defense and Commerce Departments have been pressing for some time for stiffer action towards China. The White House held them back as Obama sought to manage the relationship. But now he has decided to allow some riposte. Sending in the destroyer was a small act, but has much wider significance, and points to a continuing confrontation between the American desire to maintain the status quo and China\u2019s efforts to expand its influence."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/30/war-migration-revenge-shakespeare-world-syrian-refugee-camps", "publicationDate": "2015-10-30T14:57:48Z", "tags": ["William Shakespeare", "Culture", "Syria", "World news", "Jordan", "Stage", "Theatre", "India"], "sentences": ["In Taiwan last spring, I spoke to a filmmaker whose adaptation of Macbeth was banned by the Thai government on the grounds that it resembled too intimately the rise and fall of the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra."], "title": "War, migration and revenge: Shakespeare is the bard of today\u2019s world | Andrew Dickson", "article": "It is impossible to look at Sarah Lee\u2019s photographs of actors from the Globe theatre in London playing Hamlet at the UNHCR Zaatari camp near the Jordanian border and not feel moved. Ophelia subsides into madness, captured by the cameraphone of a Syrian refugee; Old Hamlet and another cast member squint through a barred window as their makeshift theatre is shrouded by a sandstorm. It\u2019s far from the first time, of course, that Shakespeare has put in an appearance in marginal spaces or conflict zones, and not even the first time his plays have been performed in this camp: in March last year, more than 100 Syrian children mounted their own Arabic-language production of King Lear , directed by the actor Nawar Bulbul. Like Hamlet, Lear is a tragedy whose themes \u2013 insanity, war, sundered families, loss of land \u2013 reflect the experience of many refugees. In Britain, the tormented politics of conflict and global migration can seem remote from the almighty bard. He\u2019s supposed to be insulated from that sort of thing, the figurehead of tourist-friendly middle England as well as the cosy chronicler of our island story. But mercifully, other cultures have always been more alive to Shakespeare\u2019s rebellious spirit. In America, during the war of independence, the plays were read voraciously by the founding fathers, while Coriolanus was staged as a warning against autocracy by US troops in New Hampshire and, during the siege of Boston in 1776, Abigail Adams urged on her husband John \u2013 later the second US president \u2013 using words spoken by Brutus in Julius Caesar: \u201cThere is a tide in the affairs of men / Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune \u2026\u201d   Related: Undiscovered country: the Globe's travelling Hamlet in a Jordanian refugee camp    In 20th-century South Africa, for obvious reasons, Othello had a clarion resonance: the play was translated by the founding secretary-general of the organisation that would become the African National Congress, Solomon Plaatje. Decades later a famous production starring John Kani was staged at Johannesburg\u2019s Market theatre. This was in 1987, when apartheid was still in force and only two years after the repeal of the Immorality Act, which prohibited mixed-race sex. In such an environment it would be impossible not to look at Shakespeare\u2019s drama of an interracial marriage and think of the grim realities beyond the proscenium arch. In the west we tend to think of Macbeth \u2013 like Lear \u2013 as a psychological drama: a case study of a man driven to murder, and his wife to madness, by vaulting ambition. In less settled contexts it can seem more politically ambivalent. In Kolkata in 2014, I met a group of young Bengali theatremakers whose production came under pressure from the state government because it drew attention to the corruption of the chief minister Mamata Banerjee\u2019s Trinamool Congress party. In Taiwan last spring, I spoke to a filmmaker whose adaptation of Macbeth was banned by the Thai government on the grounds that it resembled too intimately the rise and fall of the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. A 407-year-old play about a feudal Scottish king was deemed \u201cin conflict with peaceful social order\u201d.    Shakespeare was masterful at using apparently innocent fairy tales to illuminate dark truths about political reality    But, operating as he did in a world where censorship was commonplace and in which a playwright who offended those in power could lose his livelihood (or his ears), Shakespeare was masterful at using apparently innocent fairy tales to illuminate dark truths about political reality. Hamlet \u2013 as the Soviet director Grigori Kozintsev\u2019s remarkable 1964 film attests \u2013 can be a parable about a surveillance state as much as a portrait of teenage angst. Measure for Measure rivals Arthur Miller\u2019s The Crucible as a portrayal of a society consumed by sexual guilt and violent moral witch-hunts. Macbeth, written in 1606 for James I, whose parliament had nearly been blown sky-high in what would have been the largest act of terrorism in English history, trains a beady eye on those in power. In the words of the Polish critic Jan Kott, on Macbeth\u2019s representation of tyranny: \u201cOnce the mechanism has been put in motion, one is apt to be crushed by it.\u201d   Related: From Globe to global: a Shakespeare voyage around the world    In Berlin last year I interviewed the director Thomas Ostermeier, who had recently brought his own German production of Hamlet back from the Jenin camp in Ramallah. His company had performed the play and stayed for days of workshops. They had encountered Prince Hamlets by the dozen, Ostermeier said: angry, frustrated young Palestinian men denied freedom of movement, trapped in an impossible bind. On the one hand, there were father figures inciting them to murder themselves in the name of revenge; on the other, an Israeli government that seemed to regard every male under the age of 30 as a dangerous suspect. There\u2019s something rotten in more than one state.

If visitors have not lost their appetite by this point, they can finish it off with a bowl of whipped chocolate ice cream. There is no escaping the toilet theme on the drinks menu either.  \u201cWe have a great range of hot cocktails served in mini urinals,\u201d said Yaroslavskaya. Even boring old green tea came served in a tiny toilet bowl, in which it took on a disturbing yellowish hue.

The toilet bowls used as restaurant seating have been sealed shut to prevent any over-excitable patrons taking things a bit too far.

It is a policy adjustment born out of anxiety about the impact on the economy of skewed demographics, and the fear that a shrinking labour force and growing ranks of retirees will condemn China to grow old before it grows rich. But after 35 years of forced abortions, female infanticide, unregistered births and traumatised individuals, the party may find that it was easier to reduce China\u2019s families than to enlarge them. It will take rather more, at this point, than official permission to change China\u2019s birthrate significantly. In 1969, after 20 years of Maoist disorder, China was an impoverished agrarian society with a typical birthrate of six children per woman. Children were assets then, because they brought an extra pair of hands and a hedge against starvation in old age. There was little geographical or social mobility, and several generations of the family still lived together, grandparents taking care of infants as mothers laboured in the fields. Large families were officially encouraged: Mao Zedong considered Thomas Malthus a capitalist thinker and socialism, he believed, would provide. China, he boasted, could afford to lose 100 million people, thus prevailing in the nuclear war with the USSR that he thought would come.   Related: End of China\u2019s one-child policy comes tragically late for many    By 1979, Mao was dead and Deng Xiaoping took a different view. China could prosper, he thought, only if the expanding population did not eat the profits of the expanding economy. The reproductive rights of China\u2019s citizens were abolished: not only did they have to apply for permission to reproduce, but any violation could result in forced abortion, or a large fine. After more than 30 years of a sometimes brutally enforced one-child policy, Chinese society is changed for ever. A falling tally of workers and rising number of pensioners has brought into increasingly sharp focus a nagging anxiety: will China get old before it gets rich? A country that does not welcome immigration is facing a long-term demographic problem. But China may have waited too long to lift a rule long overtaken by economic and social change. This new decree \u2013 which allows married couples two children \u2013 is only a small adjustment to a 2013 policy relaxation that already permitted couples two children if one parent was an only child. Remarkably few eligible couples took up the offer, and the reasons are not hard to find. China today is a majority urban society, and those mothers who once laboured in the fields now work long hours in factories; most live hundreds or even thousands of miles from their villages, their parental support and, if they have them, their children. As migrants they are not entitled to send their children to urban schools and have nobody to take care of them while they work. There is little parental leave and less state-provided care; housing is barely affordable and a decent education expensive. China has gone from a nation in which survival and status was built on family and clan to one in which most children have no siblings, no cousins and no aunts or uncles.   Related: The Guardian view on population growth: the baby boom bonanza | Editorial    The further irony is that China, for all the misery and cruelty of its one-child policy, has achieved a birthrate no lower than that achieved by its Asian neighbours \u2013 Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea \u2013 without coercion. In Taiwan, for instance, the fertility rate had dropped to 1.8 children per woman by the late 1980s and to 0.9 by 2010. Educated urban women who can choose, as we know, tend to have small families. Today, Taiwan pays cash incentives to mothers to encourage larger families. The legacy of brutal enforcement in China is nevertheless profound: there is a national gender imbalance, the product of the preference for a male child, which could leave some 19 million young men in want of a wife. Precariously financed local governments have collected billions in fines for children born without party approval, revenues they will only reluctantly forgo. Those who could not afford to pay found other ways: in extreme cases they resorted to infanticide; others abandoned unwanted infants or sent them to relatives. One result is an unknown number of undocumented citizens, and children who have been denied access to public education or health services. Will the government truly abandon its interference in family life and declare an amnesty for the casualties of an overbearing and cruel policy?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/01/rugby-world-cup-2015-in-numbers-new-zealand", "publicationDate": "2015-11-01T16:20:19Z", "tags": ["Rugby World Cup 2015", "Rugby union", "Rugby World Cup", "Sport"], "sentences": ["Photograph: Michael Lee - Taiwan Mike/KLC fotos/Corbis     Related: New Zealand v Australia:  Rugby World Cup 2015 final \u2013 in pictures     Related: New Zealand\u2019s rugby from the future paves the way for 2019 World Cup | Dean Ryan  "], "title": "The Rugby World Cup in numbers: New Zealand lead the stats", "article": "Top points scorers 97 Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez Argentina 93 Handre Pollard SA 82 Dan Carter NZ Bernard Foley Aus     Argentina\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez, centre, was the tournament\u2019s top points scorer.

But the talks between Xi Jinping and Ma Ying-jeou, who is soon to retire, will also be seen as part of China\u2019s anticipated pushback following last week\u2019s high-profile American naval challenge to its island-building activities in the South China Sea. China initiated the meeting, ending more than half a century of ostracism at the highest level. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and seeks its reunification with the mainland. But the island has enjoyed de facto independence since the Chinese civil war ended in 1949, underpinned by American military might. Like other countries in the region, Taiwan is in dispute with Beijing over claims in the South China Sea.    Related: Historic meeting of Chinese and Taiwanese presidents prompts hope and suspicion    China-Taiwan tensions have eased somewhat during Ma\u2019s time in office as his nationalist party, the Kuomintang (KMT), has expanded cross-strait trade and tourism. But the number of Taiwanese favouring reunification has been steadily falling, while suspicion of Beijing\u2019s expansionist ambitions has grown.  Opinion polls suggest the opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP), led for the first time by a woman, Tsai Ing-wen, is on course to win the presidency in January when Ma stands down. The party is traditionally seen as favouring independence, or at the very least maintaining the status quo. A DPP success would undoubtedly anger Xi, who has said the Taiwan issue cannot remain unresolved indefinitely. Tsai complained that the announcement of the meeting came out of the blue. \u201cTo let the people know in such a hasty and chaotic manner is damaging to Taiwan\u2019s democracy,\u201d she said. The DPP spokesman Cheng Yun-peng said: \u201cHow can people not think of this as a political operation intended to affect the election?\u201d Yet if Ma is thought to be kowtowing to Xi, the Singapore meeting could backfire by stiffening opposition to China\u2019s advances. Large-scale KMT defeats in local elections last year were attributed to a backlash, especially among younger voters, against the party\u2019s perceived cosying up to Beijing. China says it has no intention of interfering in the 16 January polls, unlike in 1996 when it launched war games to try to intimidate voters.  Rejecting claims that Ma was selling out Taiwan, officials said he would make no deals, private or public, and would concentrate on promoting \u201cthe peaceful development of cross-strait relations\u201d. Since neither leader recognises the other as a head of state, the two men will address each other \u201cMr\u201d.    Related: South-east Asian ministers cancel joint accord over South China Sea dispute    Xi\u2019s sudden decision to meet Ma may be linked to escalating tension with the US. China claims sovereign rights in almost all the South China Sea, a vital international trade route. A meeting of Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) defence ministers ended in disarray this week when it failed to agree a joint communique because of the disputes.  After no headway was made in talks between US and Chinese naval commanders on last week\u2019s Spratly islands incident involving a US warship, Ash Carter, the US defence secretary, pointedly took a South China Sea \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d cruise on Thursday aboard a US aircraft carrier.  On Friday in another apparent attempt to remind weaker neighbours of the importance of a good relationship with China, Xi will visit Vietnam, which is also involved in the South China Sea disputes and has clashed with Beijing over offshore oil drilling rights.  Washington has been assiduously courting Hanoi as part its regional power struggle with Beijing. Observers say Xi may hope to mend fences and strengthen pro-China leadership contenders prior to Vietnam\u2019s Communist party national congress next year.

Ma told Xi both sides had been working \u201cto replace conflict with dialogue ... We follow different political systems, but we have developed military and economic cooperation,\u201d he said. The meeting between Communist party chief Xi and Nationalist president Ma was the first time two such leaders had come together since Mao Zedong founded the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949. The last encounter between communist and nationalist leaders came in August 1945, when Mao and Chiang Kai-shek came together in Chongqing for seven weeks of talks. Chinese state media painted the dialogue as a watershed moment which one analyst compared to Richard Nixon\u2019s 1972 trip to China, which paved the way for the normalisation of relations between Beijing and Washington. \u201cThis is also an icebreaking meeting,\u201d Tao Wenzhou, from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told CCTV, the state broadcaster. Saturday\u2019s summit, which was unexpectedly announced on Tuesday night, began at 3pm local time at Singapore\u2019s five-star Shangri-La hotel. As Xi and Ma stepped out before the cameras and were bathed in a blaze of camera flashes, the presenter of a live CCTV broadcast told viewers: \u201cThis is certainly a landmark handshake.\u201d On Saturday night, the two men were due to hold a \u201ccasual\u201d dinner at the Shang Palace, a high-end Cantonese restaurant where diners can order Australian lobster, Sri Lankan crab and Japanese beef. In an indication of the meeting\u2019s political sensitivities, Xi and Ma were reportedly planning to split the bill.  The summit represents a high point in the seven-year rapprochement between Taipei and Beijing that began in 2008, when Ma Ying-jeou took office, vowing to end the political feud between the two sides. Ma, who will step down next year following a presidential election on 16 January, has overseen a striking improvement in relations with Beijing, which still regards democratically ruled Taiwan as a renegade province. But that engagement has become increasingly contentious in Taiwan, a vibrant democracy, with many of its 18 million voters fearing closer integration with authoritarian China. Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets last year to protest that growing proximity as part of the Sunflower movement. Nathan Batto, a political scientist from Taipei\u2019s Academia Sinica, said polls showed that while nearly all Taiwanese supported improved dialogue with China, fewer and fewer now backed the idea of reunification, which is Beijing\u2019s ultimate goal. \u201cThe separations between Taiwan and China are much, much deeper than between the Koreas or the Germanys,\u201d Batto said. \u201cThe public support here is for good relations with China \u2013 nobody wants to have a war \u2013 but not for any type of political integration. Taiwanese are very proud of their democracy and want to keep it,\u201d he said. Nick Bisley, the executive director of La Trobe Asia, said Saturday\u2019s meeting was \u201cprobably the biggest thing in cross-strait relations since at least the lifting of travel restrictions\u201d more than a decade ago. But Bisley said there were concerns in Taiwan that Beijing was using the meeting to try to swing the island\u2019s upcoming elections back towards Ma\u2019s Nationalist party (KMT).   Related: Historic meeting of Chinese and Taiwanese presidents prompts hope and suspicion    Tsai Ing-wen, the Democratic Progressive party (DPP) opposition candidate, is widely expected to defeat Beijing\u2019s preferred candidate, KMT chairman Eric Chu. \u201cIn 1995/96 they tried to shape the election outcome by lobbing missiles at Taiwan,\u201d Bisley said, referring to the Taiwan Strait crisis. \u201cThis time it is a summit.\u201d Pro-independence protesters reportedly attempted to storm Taiwan\u2019s parliament on Saturday morning. Others gathered at Taipei\u2019s military airport carrying posters attacking Xi as a dictator and Ma as a traitor. Saturday\u2019s meeting, while the first between the two sides\u2019 leaders, is only the latest in a series of high-level encounters between China and Taiwan, which has been ruled as a de-facto independent state since China\u2019s civil war ended, in 1949, and Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s nationalists fled across the Taiwan Strait. The first came in 1993, when envoys from both sides met in Singapore for the first high-level talks since the war. In 2005, nationalist chairman Lien Chan, then leader of Taiwan\u2019s opposition, met Chinese president Hu Jintao in Beijing. \u201cWhat we want is conciliation.

Radar images taken from a Japanese Earth observation satellite spotted the ancient river system beneath the shallow, dusty surface, apparently winding its way from more than 500km inland towards the coast. The buried waterway may have formed part of the proposed Tamanrasett River that is thought to have flowed across parts of Western Sahara in ancient times from sources in the southern Atlas mountains and Hoggar highlands in what is now Algeria. The French-led team behind the discovery believe the river carried water to the sea during the periodic humid spells that took hold in the region over the past 245,000 years. Water may last have coursed through the channels 5,000 years ago. The river would have helped people, plants and wildlife to thrive in what is now desert land, and would have carried nutrients crucial for marine organisms far into the sea. Were it still flowing today, the river system would rank 12th among the largest on Earth, the researchers write in the journal Nature Communications. Images taken from the satellite revealed that the hidden river beds aligned almost perfectly with a huge underwater canyon that extends off the coast of Mauritania into waters more than three kilometres deep. First mapped in 2003, the Cap Timiris Canyon is 2.5km wide and a kilometre deep in places.     The outlines and the main course of the proposed Tamanrasett River are drawn in blue and grey, respectively. The newly identified river and the Cap Timiris Canyon are in dark blue on the far left of the map. Photograph: Nature Communications    Russell Wynn at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton was among the researchers who created the first 3D map of the canyon from the German Meteor research vessel. Sediment cores brought up from the canyon bottom contained fine-grained river-borne particles that suggested a massive river had first formed, and later fed into, the deep channel carved into the continental shelf. \u201cIt\u2019s a great geological detective story and it confirms more directly what we had expected. This is more compelling evidence that in the past there was a very big river system feeding into this canyon,\u201d said Wynn, who was not involved in the latest study. \u201cIt tells us that as recently as five to six thousand years ago, the Sahara desert was a very vibrant, active river system.\u201d In full flow, the river would have carried organic material from the land out into the ocean, where it sustained a rich ecosystem of filter feeders and other organisms in the canyon. But the river was destructive too, occasionally sending rapid, turbulent rushes of water and sediment down the canyon. Similar flows are still active off the coast of Taiwan today, and hold enough power to destroy submarine cables and other infrastructure. \u201cPeople sometimes can\u2019t get their head around climate change and how quickly it happens. Here\u2019s an example where within just a couple of thousand years, the Sahara went from being wet and humid, with lots of sediment being transported into the canyon, to something that\u2019s arid and dry,\u201d Wynn said.

But is it recession \u2013 or protectionism?", "article": "For one Chinese company that depends on global trade, fears over the worldwide economy have come to pass already. \u201cThe global economy is pretty bleak at the moment,\u201d says Luo Dong, the owner of Doyoung, a Beijing-based exporter of frozen seafood and fruit. \u201cThis is having a big effect on us. Our clients\u2019 sales are a lot slower than they used to be, and as purchasing power overseas drops, our exports are taking a hit.\u201d Luo\u2019s observations were echoed on a wider stage last week, when the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development voiced the fear gripping many economists: that the drop-off in trade, driven by China, may be a harbinger of something more worrying \u2013 a global recession. Days later, Rolls-Royce became the latest British exporter to face what it called \u201cheadwinds\u201d from China, joining a slew of others, from carmaker Jaguar Land Rover to luxury brand Burberry. Meanwhile, commodities including platinum and crude oil resumed their decline in value as investors continued to fret about sliding demand for the raw materials of global commerce. Beijing has cut interest rates six times in less than a year and let the yuan slide against the dollar, underlining the sense of alarm about slowing growth. Official figures show GDP expanding at around 6.9% in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, conveniently in line with the government\u2019s official target of \u201caround 7%\u201d; but outside analysts believe it may be much weaker. \u201cWe find these numbers pretty implausible,\u201d says Andrew Brigden of City consultancy Fathom. \u201cChina is slowing a lot more markedly than the official figures show.\u201d Fathom\u2019s calculations, based on alternative indicators such as electricity use, suggest GDP growth of 3% or even less. However, inside China it feels as though sluggish demand from the eurozone, rather than a homegrown problem, is to blame for the deterioration in the economic weather. Luo, whose company exports to the US, Europe, Middle East and Africa, says exports have roughly halved since last year. \u201cThe worst market has been Europe, largely due to exchange rate fluctuations,\u201d he says. The European Central Bank has deliberately driven down the value of the single currency by implementing quantitative easing. \u201cThe other major factor has been labour costs here, which have gone up about a third,\u201d Luo adds. For the UK, so far, the impact of global trade headwinds has been relatively mild, notwithstanding the tone of alarm from exporters. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the UK manufacturers\u2019 association EEF, says: \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s certainly on our members\u2019 radar, and it\u2019s a source of concern.\u201d     Angel Gurr\u00eda of the OECD: \u2018Global trade, which was already growing slowly over the past few years, appears to have stagnated.\u2019 Photograph: Evaristo Sa/AFP/Getty Images    But for a string of other countries, especially those heavily dependent on commodities exports, the result has been economic chaos \u2013 and the OECD fears worse may be to come. After the great financial crisis hit in 2008, reports that demand for exports had \u201cfallen off a cliff\u201d, as it was often put at the time, were among the first signals that a deep downturn was under way. \u201cGlobal trade, which was already growing slowly over the past few years, appears to have stagnated,\u201d said Angel Gurr\u00eda, the OECD\u2019s secretary general, presenting its latest economic forecasts and predicting trade growth of around 2% this year. \u201cWhat happened in the past 50 years whenever there was such a slowdown in trade growth, it was a harbinger of a very sharp turn of the economy for the worse.\u201d Gurr\u00eda explained that the recent slowdown in emerging market economies, led by China, had been particularly damaging because it had come at a time when the advanced economies, in particular the eurozone and Japan, were not yet growing at a robust enough pace to drive global growth. \u201cA further sharp slowdown in emerging market economies is weighing down on activity and trade. At the same time, subdued investment and productivity growth are checking the momentum of the recovery in advanced economies. It\u2019s a double whammy,\u201d Gurr\u00eda said. The OECD\u2019s prescription for this malaise is a collective effort by the advanced economies to ramp up investment \u2013 helping to boost demand, improve productivity and generate stronger growth. A similar approach was set out by President Barack Obama on Friday, and he is likely to press for more action to prop up domestic demand at this weekend\u2019s G20 meeting in Turkey. But with Germany and the UK still enthusiastically espousing austerity, any commitment to new investment seems highly unlikely; so economists have been left trying to count the costs of China\u2019s transition from high-speed, export-led growth to a new economic model at a time when demand in other markets is far from booming. Economist and China-watcher George Magnus reckons the world will avoid recession, but the damage will be severe for economies that have hitched themselves to the Chinese bandwagon in recent years. \u201cIn Africa, exports to China are 12% of total exports, but three-quarters of the exposure is concentrated among five countries: Angola, South Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo and Equatorial Guinea,\u201d he said in a recent blogpost. \u201cIn Australia, exports to China are a third of total exports. In Latin America, exports to China are about 2% of regional GDP.\u201d Most of these countries are exporters of coal, oil and minerals, and their struggles coincide with the end of what became known as the \u201ccommodities supercycle\u201d \u2013 a decade or so in which prices were held aloft by the belief that demand for raw materials would continue rising, as developing economies became the engines of global growth.     Protests in Brazil, which is now in recession. Photograph: Imago/Barcroft Media    Goldman Sachs\u2019s decision to close down its loss-making Bric fund was a symbolic reminder that the days are gone when the economic rise of Brazil, Russia, India and China (the four countries from which the fund drew its name) seemed guaranteed. Indeed, Brazil and Russia are both in recession. The US Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to raise interest rates from near zero, which many experts now expect to happen next month, could deepen the agony of countries already struggling with plunging currencies and rising borrowing costs. The International Monetary Fund has warned of a flurry of bankruptcies in emerging economies as rates rise. \u201cA lot of these countries haven\u2019t been helping themselves: Taiwan, Korea; they\u2019ve all been cranking up their own credit growth,\u201d says Russell Jones of Llewellyn Consulting, an economics advisory firm. But he too believes the world should escape a general slump. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re on the cusp of a major downturn \u2014 probably more of the same.\u201d Simon Evenett of St Gallen University in Switzerland, who collates detailed data for the thinktank Global Trade Alert, offers an alternative explanation for the recent slide in trade volumes. He calculates that about half of the fall, since exports peaked in September last year, has been caused by the commodity price rout; but the rest, rather than evidence of sickly global demand, has resulted from a creeping rise in protectionism. His analysis suggests the declines have overwhelmingly taken place in just 28 categories of product. \u201cThat\u2019s very concentrated; that makes me doubt that it\u2019s a global downturn.\u201d Eight of these categories are commodities; but the rest map closely on to areas where countries have taken protectionist measures. In the wake of the financial crisis, policymakers from the G20 countries pledged not to resort to the tit-for-tat protectionism that led to collapsing trade volumes in the wake of the Great Crash of 1929, and was ultimately seen as a contributor to the Great Depression. Since then, there has been little sign of anything with the scope of America\u2019s Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930, which slapped import tariffs on more than 800 products. But Evenett says there has been a flurry of more subtle manoeuvres: restricting public procurement to domestic firms, for example, or quietly tightening regulations to raise the bar against imports. \u201cI think the China story is adding spice to it, but I think there\u2019s more going on here,\u201d he says. He is concerned that unless action is taken, politicians will continue to throw sand in the wheels of the international trading system. If he\u2019s right, the downturn seen so far may not be sending a warning signal about global demand; instead, it would be best read as a measure of the fragility of globalisation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/15/the-peat-inn-restaurant-review-jay-rayner", "publicationDate": "2015-11-15T06:00:01Z", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Restaurants", "Restaurants", "Life and style", "Travel"], "sentences": ["It includes chefs from Taiwan, Japan, Poland and Mexico (northcote.com)."], "title": "The Peat Inn: restaurant review | Jay Rayner", "article": "The Peat Inn, near St Andrews, Fife (01334 840 206). Lunch for two: \u00a375-\u00a3110. Dinner for two: \u00a3140 The Peat Inn is nothing new. It\u2019s so not new, the whole village carries its name. That\u2019s because the inn was here, amid the rolling pastures of Fife, from the mid-1700s, long before anybody thought to live around it. But it\u2019s also another kind of not new. In 1972 a chef called David Wilson came to cook here, bringing good taste, technique and an interest in the area\u2019s produce, when these things were less the minimum qualifying standard they are now than an eccentricity. In the mid-80s he won Scotland\u2019s first Michelin star, at a time when they were one of the few ways of keeping score. The Peat Inn has form. Wilson sold up in 2005 to Geoffrey Smeddle, another classically trained chef with time at the Orrery and Caf\u00e9 Royal in London, who had then run the Conran group\u2019s first restaurant in Glasgow. (He\u2019s also a food columnist for the Sunday Herald with a fine turn of phrase). Early this year, the Peat Inn closed for a refurb. It has emerged bespoke and trim and glossy. There is caramel-coloured blonde-wood panelling of a modernist cut, and creamy tweed-patterned upholstery. Mostly there is some very fine, unforced and, in places, exceptionally witty cookery. The Peat Inn still has form. God, but it\u2019s civilised. It\u2019s a room in which life feels good and unrushed. But then it comes with the territory, literally. If you\u2019re looking for the Scotland of rough edges and hard-furrowed brows this bit of the country between the Firth of Forth and the Tay, focussed on St Andrews, is not quite the place to come. When looking for somewhere to eat on this trip it became clear to me that most of the action really was here on the south side of the Tay.     \u2018Silky\u2019: cream of cauliflower soup with hare. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian    It is gentle and tidy and just a little bit manicured, and in places not short of cash. In the evenings, for example, starters here at the Peat Inn are in the mid- to high teens with mains well into the twenties. At lunchtime, however, on slightly less elaborate dishes, they are close to half that. There\u2019s also a three-course lunch menu at just \u00a319. On a Friday, it is full of elders of the tribe who know a good thing when they see it and have the time to take advantage of such possibilities. The room is alive with sunlight and chatter, laughter and sigh.    A tartare of sea bream is all briskness and sea, an oyster mousse sending it all merrily on its way    Smeddle is big on technique and precision without sacrificing flavour. He\u2019s also determined not to scare anyone. To kick off, we are given a bowl of baby-pink ham hock under a bubble of mushroom mousse. A couple of years ago the latter would have been described as a foam, because that\u2019s exactly what it is: a rich, mouth-coating mushroom sauce that has been extruded from the business end of a nitrous gun. But this is not the crowd for foams, so mousse it must be and very lovely it is, too. The restaurant may feel at times like a redoubt against the elements outside, but his ingredients are an expression of that landscape at this time of year. A silky cauliflower soup is studded with sweet, crumbly chestnuts and, more importantly, pieces of hare \u2013 the shameless exhibitionist of the game world. There are tangles of braised shoulder and slices of loin with that deep, gutsy kick that only this animal can be depended upon to deliver. By contrast, a tartare of sea bream is all briskness and sea, an oyster mousse \u2013 another chance for the nitrous gun to shine \u2013 sending it all merrily on its way.     \u2018Long-cooked to unctuous\u2019: daube of veal. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian    Main courses are thoroughly butch. There is a glorious piece of darkly glazed veal, described as a \u201cslow-braised daube\u201d which has been long-cooked to unctuous. It falls apart with just a tickle of the fork, like it senses its work is done. Alongside are ribbons of salsify dressed with hard cheese and egg yolk and crisped fragments of bacon, allowing the word \u201ccarbonara\u201d to be attached. I laugh at my plate. Or with it. Roast breast and confit leg of mallard, with root vegetables and puy lentils, is that perfect combination of good taste and crowd pleaser. At the end there is a perky lemon posset with an orange macaroon, and a blousy tumescence of banana and passion fruit souffl\u00e9 with a chocolate and rum sauce. This is one of those sweet, childlike moments, made distinctly adult, with lots of brisk acidity. And then the chocolate sauce is poured in and it becomes something altogether more intense, serious and grown up. It is both duck-feather light and a bruiser of a souffl\u00e9. It demands a few seconds\u2019 silence and a little attention. It is a classy end to an exceptionally classy meal. Later that evening, after a trip to the theatre in Dundee, I found myself in the brasserie of the city\u2019s Malmaison hotel. If we\u2019re to talk about an improvement in food culture, then it\u2019s actually less about having a good time on planned trips than striking gold on the accidental ones. So let me put on the record that the ribeye and the sirloin steaks at the Dundee Malmaison were terrific pieces of animal, brilliantly cooked, with a pronounced char and served with a very fine b\u00e9arnaise and chips. When the Malmaison chain first opened years ago they were a blessed relief from awful, characterless inner-city hotels. It\u2019s reassuring to see they can still do the thing.     The \u2018perky\u2019 lemon posset. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian    They also have a smart wine list which should serve as a model for many others in the mid-market. There are 40 or so well-chosen wines, banded at price point \u2013 \u00a320, \u00a322, \u00a325, \u00a330 and \u00a335 \u2013 with almost all of them available by small and large glass and 500ml, as well as the full bottle. Shockingly, it almost reads as if somebody had thought carefully about the wine offering. I took advantage of it rather enthusiastically. And so, the next morning, in search of carbs I found my way to the Palais Tea Room, a knowingly retro cafe round the corner on Union Street, with its heart in the 1950s and its tongue in its cheek. Tables are covered with laminated pages of comics in celebration of Dundee\u2019s great DC Thomson, publishers of the Beano. More importantly, they have cake. They have cake like Scotland has weather: big multi-layered ones, beautifully displayed under glass. Try the sticky toffee pudding cake, warmed through and with a glug of cream. Then go for a good long walk. Jay\u2019s news bites \u25a0 The \u00a319 lunch menu at the Peat Inn is hard to beat, but Fischer\u2019s at Baslow Hall, Derbyshire, is not far behind with three courses at \u00a320.15. Currently it features hay-baked partridge, belly and fillet of Derbyshire pork and a blackberry parfait. The quality of cooking is always assured, but the menu is only available until 4 December (fischers-baslowhall.co.uk). \u25a0 Think London property rental prices are too high?

Officials hope that the new reserve will boost sustainable tourism revenues as well as fish populations, as ordinary divers and even snorkelers will be able to experience the difference that protection measures can make.  Palau, a string of Micronesian islands just east of the Philippines, is one of the world\u2019s top diving destinations, located by a deep trench where tourists can swim with large ocean-going species such as silky shark, pelagic rays, bigeye tuna, marlin and swordfish.   Related: Marine life halved: Brian Skerry's rare images of most endangered \u2013 in pictures    All of these species have been decimated by international fishing fleets (in Palau\u2019s case from Taiwan and Japan) that are weakly regulated by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, which manages 60% of the world\u2019s tuna catch. Bigeye, which can grow to a weight of 170kg and 2.5 metres in length, is prized by sashimi lovers, and is the main target of the longline fleet that dominates Palau\u2019s waters. The species has been overfished for years and the spawning population is now down to 16% of its original size, according to the Oceanic Fisheries programme manager, John Hampton. His team has unsuccessfully recommended for years that the catch be reduced by a third.   The tuna target species (bigeye, yellowfin and albacore) are only about one-third of the take, according to estimates. The longliners deploy miles of lines with thousands of baited hooks that also catch silky and blue sharks, turtles, dolphinfish, barracuda, swordfish, sailfish and marlin \u2013 all species in decline.     Workers haul a sailfish aboard a Taiwanese longline fishing vessel. These species are bycatch in tuna ling-line fishing. Photograph: Alex Hofford/Greenpeace/AFP/Getty Images    Large as it may seem at 500,000 sq km, the Palau no-take area, which will be phased in over five years, is small compared to the distance most of these oceanic fish cover. But not all of them: A recent study of bigeye, for instance, found that about 10% were likely to spend their whole life in an area the size of Palau\u2019s sanctuary.  Another unpublished study, co-authored by Daniel Pauly of the University of British Columbia, suggests that this 10% will grow as the \u201clazy\u201d genes they pass on to their spawn allow them to survive and multiply. \u201cThis shows that giant marine reserves can play a major role in mitigating overfishing even of ocean species that usually travel very long distances,\u201d said Pauly.      Scuba diver watching Palau nautiluses. Photograph: Alamy    This increase in density of ocean-going fish will mean that divers, who contribute about 40% to Palau\u2019s economy, will have a more exciting experience \u2013 and therefore be prepared to pay a premium.  This would help balance the rising numbers of tourists with managing the resources they consume in a country of only 21,000 people. Numbers have gone up from100,000 to 160,000 in five years \u2013 mostly non-divers from China \u2013 putting pressure on the reefs and infrastructure.  To offset an expected loss of revenues from fishing licences sold to the foreign longline fleet, the government is planning to double the exit fee that tourists pay at the airport to $100, increasing income and hopefully decreasing their numbers.  \u201cWe believe our future lies in high-end tourism, not fishing,\u201d said Umiich Sengebau, the minister of natural resources, environment and tourism. \u201cThis sanctuary is in line with our promotion of \u2018pristine paradise Palau\u2019.\u201d   Palau marine reserve    In addition, Alan Friedlander, a marine biologist at the University of Hawaii who has studied Palau points out, the expected increase in the catch of oceanic species in the 20% of Palau\u2019s waters where fishing is set to continue will alleviate pressure to fish in the near-shore reefs, where much of the seafood served to the tourists currently originates.  Steven Victor of the Nature Conservancy in Palau says that while the state has banned fishing in about a quarter of its reef-lined coastline and stocks are increasing there, they are decreasing in the rest.  \u201cWe know there will be benefits from this closure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know when.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/17/ex-taiwan-president-chiang-ching-kuo-home-mcdonalds-restaurant", "publicationDate": "2015-11-17T12:59:35Z", "tags": ["Taiwan", "China", "McDonald's", "Asia Pacific", "Business", "World news"], "sentences": ["McDonald\u2019s has turned a house where the son of Chinese nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek once lived into a restaurant, dividing opinion in China and Taiwan.", "Chiang Kai-shek fled the mainland in 1949 after the Kuomintang was defeated by the communists, retreating to Taiwan where his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, was president from 1978 to 1988.", "An error during the editing process led to us saying the house was in Taiwan rather than in Hangzhou, China."], "title": "Ex-Taiwan president's home turned into a McDonald's restaurant", "article": "McDonald\u2019s has turned a house where the son of Chinese nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek once lived into a restaurant, dividing opinion in China and Taiwan.

I\u2019ve given over 45 years of my life to the church,\u201d the 45-year-old resident of Salt Lake City said. \u201cAfter this latest policy announcement, I can no longer be associated with such a hateful church.\u201d Lori said the LDS church today is not the same church she was raised in. When she was a kid, she said, all the songs she learned were about Jesus, not the church\u2019s modern prophets who were in the songs her kids were learning. A good friend was excommunicated in the 1970s for being gay, she said, and she almost walked out of worship the day church leaders asked members to send money to support Proposition 8, the 2008 initiative to repeal same-sex marriage in California. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real misconception on the part of active members that those who are leaving are somehow angry, or weren\u2019t believers anyway,\u201d Lori said. \u201cThe opposite is the truth. You have people believe so much in being kind and what the church stood for, for them, and seeing that their leaders are enacting a policy that\u2019s against everything they were ever taught.\u201d     Sandy Newcomb stands with a flag near the Salt Lake Temple. Photograph: Jim Urquhart/Reuters    \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see anyone leave the church,\u201d LDS church spokesperson Eric Hawkins said in an emailed statement. \u201cEspecially people who have been struggling with any aspect in their life. The church exists to build people and help them heal, and there isn\u2019t one of us who doesn\u2019t need help at some point in our lives.\u201d Hawkins wrote that it is important for Mormons to read what their church leaders have said about the issue, referencing a letter and commentary published online. Children of same-sex couples who were already baptized will not have their church membership curtailed, the letter explains. Furthermore, the recent changes reflect existing church doctrine: same-sex attraction is not a sin, but acting on that attraction is.  Proponents of the new policy have said it is in place to protect families and children. \u201cThere\u2019s a mistaken sentiment that the church wants to punish children for the sins of the parents,\u201d said Kylea Knecht, a Mormon from Nevada now living in Oregon. \u201cAnyone who knows anything about church doctrine will tell you that\u2019s not true. We believe people are accountable for their own decisions, never for their parents\u2019.\u201d Knecht rejects the idea that Mormons are hateful or discriminatory, adding that LGBT Mormons and their children can still participate in \u201calmost all aspects of the church\u201d. \u201cCan you imagine how difficult it might be for an eight-year-old, or even a 12- or 15-year-old, to choose to join a church that believes their parents are making an immoral choice by being married?\u201d Knecht added. \u201cSo instead the leadership of the church asks children to wait. They don\u2019t ask them, or even their parents, not to come and participate. Just to wait to be baptized until they can commit to live the gospel.\u201d The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a Christian offshoot with roots in the 19th-century United States. Joseph Smith, who is held as a prophet, founded the church in 1830. Mormons follow both the Bible and the Book of Mormon and believe revelations from God are ongoing. The modern church is largely centered in Utah, after the Mormons had been expelled from the United States in the 1800s following a series of small conflicts now called the Mormon Wars. The Church didn\u2019t have a specific stance on homosexuality until the 1950s, said John Gustav-Wrathal of Affirmation, a global support organization for LGBT Mormons. Until the 1990s, Mormons could be excommunicated from the church for being gay. \u201cI think that, right now, we are at a point where the general membership is much more empathetic,\u201d Gustav-Wrathal said. \u201cEven now, the conservative position in the church is much more moderate than it was 20 years ago.\u201d  But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult situation right now for a lot of people in the Church, who are really struggling with this and trying to make sense of it, and trying to reconcile what they know about LGBT friends and family and the church and official policy.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/20/malaysian-police-report-warns-of-suicide-bombers-ahead-of-asean-summit", "publicationDate": "2015-11-20T04:33:47Z", "tags": ["Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)", "Malaysia", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Paris attacks", "France", "Paris", "Europe"], "sentences": ["Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei all have overlapping claims with China in the South China Sea, where more than $4.5 trillion in sea trade passes each year."], "title": "Malaysian police report warns of suicide bombers ahead of Asean summit", "article": "A leaked Malaysian police report warns there are 10 suicide bombers in Kuala Lumpur, where the country will host the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit this weekend.

On Wednesday 18 November the Guardian Small Business Network hosted a seminar in Birmingham for UK manufacturing businesses wanting to break into new markets.  A panel of experts, including Luis Arriaga, UPS\u2019s district manager for the UK, Ireland and Nordics, Stewart Ferguson, head of research at the China-Britain Business Council, Richard Halstead, regional director, Midlands and the east, EEF and Richard Heald, chief executive, UK India Business Council, shared their advice at the Trade Boost event, which was sponsored by UPS. Here\u2019s a selection of their top tips:  Be proactive not reactiveMany businesses start exporting in response to customer demand, but if you make the decision yourself, says Arriaga, \u201cit allows you to go to market very quickly and understand the potential challenges that could exist and how to remove those barriers.\u201d   Don\u2019t spread yourself too thinly It\u2019s better to focus your resources on a small number of key markets.   Look beyond EuropeJoseph Jackson, international trades manager at Barclays, cited the example of a small business importing football kits from China and selling to the UK market. The business planned to start exporting to Italy, another country with a strong footballing culture, but it would have meant new premises and additional staff. UKTI advised it instead to look at the Far East, where the football season starts at a different time of year. The business did so, and is now successfully exporting to the Far East without having to expand.   Research your markets thoroughlyOther countries may have particular infrastructure and regulatory challenges. Heald says of India: \u201cYou can\u2019t get off the plane and treat it like a European market.\u201d   Take time to understand different cultural attitudesFerguson says: \u201cIn China, and much of the Far East, business is developed out of a good personal relationship. No matter how lovely your product or service is, if the person you\u2019re meeting who has to sign the cheque doesn\u2019t personally like you, they will never do business with you.\u201d   Choose the right partnersBrompton Bikes has outlets in other countries, but only partners with people who care about the product. In Taiwan, CEO Will Butler-Adams turned down the opportunity to partner with an experienced business in favour of an architect with a love of bikes. He now has 18 shops and is also the company\u2019s partner in China.   Get close to the marketUPS\u2019s Matt Guffey advises travelling to different markets to improve your understanding. In particular, take advantage of trade missions.   Establish a clear digital strategyAnd make sure it is specifically tailored to your targeted customer or targeted market. \u201cWebsite design is very important, including current exchange, and also delivery information. The end consumer wants to know when their goods will arrive, whether it\u2019s B2C or B2B,\u201d says Guffey.   Sell to other businessesThe B2B e-commerce market is growing twice as fast as B2C.   The best markets aren\u2019t always the obvious onesFerguson told delegates that while companies often assume Hong Kong is a good fit, Hong Kong has a population of seven million, whereas Shenzhen alone, a city in the Chinese province of Guangdong, has a population of 11 million, with a higher disposable income. It \u201cdwarfs the opportunity in Hong Kong\u201d, he said.

He grew mimosa flowers and lived in a small hilltop town in northwestern Italy, an ancient jumble of narrow cobbled streets, wooden shutters and wrought-iron balconies. Carbone was very keen on local history. He spent many hours in state and church archives painstakingly reconstructing the town\u2019s 1,000-year story. In 1079 Seborga was designated an imperial principality of the Holy Roman Empire. It remained independent for more than 600 years, until it was sold to the House of Savoy, a transaction that was not registered.   Related: Do we notice changes in global temperature?    This error was subsequently compounded. When the great powers of Europe settled the continent\u2019s boundaries at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Seborga was not mentioned. When the many small states on the Italian peninsula were unified to form Italy in 1861, Seborga was not mentioned. In 1946, after the last Savoy king abdicated and Italy became a republic, again Seborga was not mentioned. In 1995 Carbone put it to the good people of Seborga that their town was not, after all, a part of Italy. In a local referendum, they voted 304 in favour, four against, to ratify Seborga\u2019s independence, which, according to Carbone, it had never lost. Seborgans elected Carbone to represent them. Their kindly ruler held court at the Bianca Azzura bar, often wearing a sword and rosette medallions. He adopted a motto for the principality: Sub umbra sede (Sit in the shade). You may well scoff. Needless to say, the Italian government refuses to recognise the Principality of Seborga, insisting its citizens still pay their taxes to the authorities in Rome. This they do, but it doesn\u2019t detract from their feeling of group identity. After all, Seborga\u2019s history of independence is rather longer than Italy\u2019s, even if it is now a matter for debate.    Seborga\u2019s kindly ruler adopted a motto for the principality: Sub umbra sede (Sit in the shade)    Establishing what constitutes a country is not straightforward. The concept is old but also notoriously slippery. As soon as you think you have a clear definition you run into exceptions and anomalies. One answer might be that all \u201creal\u201d countries have membership of the United Nations. But this is not definitive. Taiwan was a UN member until asked to leave in 1971; Israel has been a UN member since 1949, but more than 30 other UN states refuse to recognise Israel\u2019s existence. Many dictionaries, under the entry for \u201cnation\u201d, talk about a body of people that is sufficiently conscious of its unity to form a government. These are also essential criteria \u2013 along with a claim to territory \u2013 for statehood, according to the Montevideo Convention, which provides a widely accepted legal definition. So just because no \u201creal\u201d country recognises your existence doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t exist. Ask the Seborgans, Taiwanese or Israelis. Other claims to nationhood have still deeper roots. In southernmost South America, the Mapuche people enjoyed 10,000 years of self-rule \u2013 never conquered by either Inca or Spanish empires \u2013 until the last century saw them being suppressed and sidelined. But now in both Chile and Argentina, governments have recognised indigenous peoples\u2019 rights, including the right to land. Seborga and Mapuche. The names may sound fictional, but they are undeniably real places, occupied by patriotic citizens. They comprise part of a shadowy, parallel world of unrecognised countries, a world of wannabe nations that, at least for now, exist only in the minds of the people who live there.

Son of Norman and Evelyn Heaton, Brian was born in Keighley, West Yorkshire, where his father managed a wool factory. He studied English at Leeds University, returning there in 1968 as lecturer in English for overseas students. He subsequently developed this one-man, one-room role into a freestanding internationally renowned English language unit. In the interim, having gained a PGCE teaching qualification and applied to the colonial service, Brian worked for the Education Department in Hong Kong. There he became expert in the teaching of English as a foreign language, and in developing teaching materials relevant to the culture of international students. In 1968 he co-founded the professional network Specialist English Language Materials for University Students, which later became the British Association of Lecturers in English for Academic Purposes. His experience of different cultures enabled him to foster a sense of community and shared goals among international students from diverse backgrounds. He also contributed a key component to Leeds University\u2019s postgraduate diploma in teaching English as a second/foreign language. Already a published writer of short stories and teaching materials while in Hong Kong, Brian became a prolific author of course books. Having devised an English test for international students entering Leeds University, Brian became an expert in English language proficiency testing, and was invited by the British Council to take part in numerous professional training programmes, principally in Europe. He was a visiting professor, first in Singapore in the 1970s, and then in Japan in the 1980s, representing the Cambridge Examination Syndicate, and subsequently continued this role during a visit to China in the 1990s, where he specified the Cambridge Business English test for China. Brian used his talents, contacts and geniality to take a key role in a variety of contexts. These included involvement in the 1970s in improving the language skills of overseas NHS psychiatrists, and in the 1980s delivering a language and culture programme for English teachers from across the Soviet Union, under the British-Soviet cultural agreement administered by the British Council. In the 1990s he helped his department to win repeated contracts to deliver English programmes for young diplomatic staff from Taiwan. Brian had wider interests in music and painting. He played the piano, and when living in Singapore took classes in Chinese painting techniques. In retirement in the UK he took up oil painting. He is survived by his wife, Elisa, a musician and teacher, whom he met in his early working life in Hong Kong and married in 1958, by me and by two grandsons."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/dec/10/zara-inditex-dismisses-china-slump-fears-profit-rise", "publicationDate": "2015-12-10T15:13:56Z", "tags": ["Zara", "Fashion industry", "Fashion", "Retail industry", "Business", "China", "Spain", "World news", "Europe", "Asia Pacific", "Life and style"], "sentences": ["At the same time Zara\u2019s online operation is being extended to cover all of the European Union, Taiwan and Hong Kong, while zarahome.com has launched in Australia."], "title": "Zara owner dismisses China slump fears as it reports 20% profit rise", "article": " Inditex, the owner of clothing retailer Zara, has said it is optimistic about its prospects in China despite the slowing economy, claiming mid-market brands were not feeling the pinch.

What we do in tending and caring for our plants is surely conservation in its strictest sense. I don\u2019t know any individual gardener who doesn\u2019t show a deep empathy for the natural world and the wonders it brings humanity. Put a gardener out in the countryside and the thing they invariably notice first is the plants. Most gardeners do not suffer from plant blindness.      Robbie Blackhall-Miles is a Plant Heritage Plant Guardian for Aristolochia curcurbitifolia, a vulnerable species from China and Taiwan. Photograph: Robbie Blackhall-Miles    We live in a time when the world\u2019s plant life is more at risk than it ever has been. There are an estimated 400,000 species of plant on this planet and at least a quarter of them are threatened with extinction. Climate change is one of the largest challenges the world faces: it saw us hit a 1C increase in global temperature this year. The world\u2019s governments agree that the planting of vast numbers of trees could be a first line of defence against it. Is it us gardeners who will be growing these trees in order for them to be planted?  Conservation however does not always have to happen on a large scale for it to be effective. The planting of a trillion trees seems like the kind of big conservation that is beyond the individual, yet for me, as a gardener, planting trees is a normal part of my life. Planting a single tree in your garden is a big step toward better air quality, reduced noise pollution, increased shade, reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and overall a much nicer, more biodiverse, environment.  In 2002 the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) set 16 targets to halt the loss of plant diversity worldwide by 2020. These targets are called the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC); gardens and gardeners are important to many of them. One of the targets set by the GSPC is that we should have more than 75% of threatened species in plant collections and that 20% of these should be available for restoration programmes in the wild. In the UK we have surpassed this target, with 77% of our threatened native species in plant collections and 40% available for restoration, but worldwide there are less than than 30% of threatened species in cultivation. The majority of these are in seed banks and botanic gardens, yet you don\u2019t have to be either to be able to count toward this target \u2013 you just have to make sure that the conservationists know about the threatened plants you are growing. One way is through joining Plant Heritage\u2019s National Plant Collections scheme or their Plant Guardians scheme.  The GSPC concentrates on wild species, but plant conservation is about all plant diversity. A simple act can result in a species or cultivar, a set of genes, being saved; particularly in a time when plant life is being so severely affected by new and emerging pests and diseases. Anne Tweddle, a member of Plant Heritage, asked if she could take cuttings from many of the unusual box varieties held in the then National Collection of Buxus. The collection had to be withdrawn due to box blight (Cylindrocladium buxicola and Pseudonectria buxi) but Anne had registered her box cuttings as part of the Plant Guardian Scheme and is now able to provide disease-free material of Buxus species and cultivars which would have otherwise died out in cultivation. This is real plant conservation being done by an individual in their own back garden. Anne had not kept the information about the plants to herself; she let a conservation organisation, Plant Heritage, know they were there. Another of those GSPC targets is that we need to conserve at least 70% of crop diversity and the associated local knowledge that goes with it. With climate change and those new pests and diseases to worry about, who knows when we may need the genes held in the older \u201cheritage\u201d varieties of food crops or their wild relatives in order to sustain humanity. So when you buy that \u201cheritage\u201d marrow or old variety of carrot, you are not just growing a novelty; you are sustaining a resource for the future of humanity. Make some effort to maintain that rare \u201cheritage\u201d variety your grandma grew in cultivation, propagate it and spread it far and wide. Growing an expanding collection of plant species in my North Wales back garden has led me to register these on the Plant Search Database run by Botanic Garden Conservation International. This database is another source of information for the GSPC, and it allows scientists and conservationists to see what plants are being grown in botanic gardens and other plant collections around the world. I am on the verge of taking it one step even further and setting up a research nursery, so that I can help conserve even more of the world\u2019s threatened plants. However, plant conservation must not be the mission of the few. If humanity is to survive and have any resilience toward climate change, plants will be our first line of defence.  All of us gardeners are conservationists. By growing just one species, cultivar or variety of plant, you could save it from extinction. By telling others about it, you make sure it is available for reintroduction or breeding. By sharing it around you make sure that, should anything happen to yours, it, and the valuable genes it holds, will never be lost."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/18/islamic-states-defeat-by-iraqi-forces-just-a-matter-of-time-says-top-navy-official", "publicationDate": "2015-12-18T06:31:10Z", "tags": ["Islamic State", "Australian defence force", "Iraq", "Syria", "Australia news", "Australian politics", "China", "Middle East and North Africa", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Related: China initiates Taiwan meeting as South China Sea tensions rise    That happens about four to eight times a year, with daily flights for up to a fortnight."], "title": "Islamic State's defeat by Iraqi forces just a matter of time, says top navy official", "article": "The defeat of Islamic State by Iraqi forces is now \u201ca matter of when, not if\u201d according to Australia\u2019s chief of joint operations, V-Adm David Johnston. Johnston told journalists the recent advances by Iraqi government troops around Ramadi, east of Baghdad and near Sinjar in the north, and the recapture of parts of Baji, had led to a significant shift in momentum, and had made it difficult for Isis to move forces and equipment between battlefields and to resupply its fighters.

Johnston said he believed about 10,000 Daesh fighters had been killed in Iraq this year and another 10,000 in Syria.  He said Australia had now participated in 917 airstrikes as part of the coalition assisting the fight against Isis in Iraq and Syria. There was a \u201cthorough analysis\u201d after each airstrike and \u201cto my knowledge ... we have not caused civilian combat casualties\u201d. Ramadi fell to Isis in May, in a big blow to Iraqi forces. Johnston also used the media conference to defend the deployment of RAAF aircraft over the South China Sea. He said the patrols had been taking place for more than 30 years and would continue to fly wherever it was allowed under international law, including near territory claimed by Beijing. In late November, an RAAF Orion flew close enough to one of China\u2019s reclaimed islands to prompt a radio challenge from a Chinese warship.   Related: Isis benefits from Iraq awash with weapons    That incident was monitored by a BBC media crew in another aircraft, sparking claims the RAAF was often patrolling near disputed territory to send a message to China. Johnston would not say just how close the RAAF aircraft was to Chinese-claimed territory. \u201cWe go wherever international law enables us to go,\u201d he said. China claims virtually all of the South China Sea, and inflamed regional tensions when it started building its own islands on disputed reefs, adding airstrips, radar, and communications and defence systems, as well as troops. It insists the 12-nautical-mile territorial limit applies. The US, Australia and other nations cite international law, which says the rule does not apply for artificial islands. Johnston said RAAF aircraft had been engaged in Operation Gateway since 1980, conducting patrols of the Indian Ocean and South China Sea.   Related: China initiates Taiwan meeting as South China Sea tensions rise    That happens about four to eight times a year, with daily flights for up to a fortnight. During these missions, aircraft operate from the Butterworth air base in Malaysia. He said Chinese ships had challenged RAAF aircraft previously and so what happened last month was not unique.

In addition, Japan will increase the number of military personnel on its islands in the East China Sea by about a fifth to almost 10,000 over the next five years. While China is not usually referred to by name in unclassified defence documents, Japanese officials stated that a push by the conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to boost Japan\u2019s military reach was intended to keep China at bay in the strategically and economically crucial Western Pacific. Once the new military hardware is in place, Chinese ships sailing from their eastern seaboard must pass Japanese missile batteries to reach the Western Pacific, an area Beijing considers vital both as a supply line and for projecting its growing naval power. While Chinese warships are entitled to sail through the area under international law, they will have to do so in plain sight of Japanese missiles, a government official in Tokyo told Reuters.   Japan's East China Sea islands   Toshi Yoshihara, a professor at the US Naval War College, said the move would enable Tokyo to limit China\u2019s room for manoeuvre through the East China Sea to the Western Pacific and give the US-Japan alliance more time to respond to a conflict involving China. \u201cYou could say Japan is turning the tables on China,\u201d Yoshihara said. Concern over China\u2019s maritime and aerial presence in the East China Sea \u2013 including around the disputed Senkaku island chain \u2013 mirrors unease over Beijing\u2019s construction of manmade island bases in the contested Spratly archipelago in the South China Sea. Last month, Abe, without naming China, cautioned against attempts to militarise the South China Sea, voicing \u201cserious concerns\u201d over land reclamation in the area. Experts believe that boosting defences along a \u201cfirst island chain\u201d stretching from Japan\u2019s East China Sea territory and south through the Philippines could serve as a boundary between US and Chinese spheres of influence in the region. \u201cIn the next five or six years, the first island chain will be crucial in the military balance between China, and the US and Japan,\u201d said Satoshi Morimoto, a professor at Takushoku University and former defence minister. The recent thaw in bilateral ties has reminded Japan and China of the need to avoid unintended clashes around the Japanese-controlled Senkakus. They are expected to speed up the formation of a maritime and aerial communication mechanism to prevent an accidental collision near the islands from quickly escalating into war. At the same time, Japan has stepped up its defence readiness amid China\u2019s military buildup and its frequent patrols near the disputed islands, which the Chinese call Diaoyu. Only last week, two Chinese coastguard vessels sailed briefly into Japanese territorial waters around the islands, the 33rd time they have done so this year. Japan\u2019s increasing sense of caution over Chinese military activity is being reflected in higher defence spending and strategic a shift away from its northern maritime border with Russia to its long and porous southern reaches. The defence ministry is seeking a record 5.09tn yen (\u00a327bn) in next year\u2019s budget, including money for longer-range anti-ship missiles, Global Hawk drones and Osprey tilt rotor aircraft. \u2022 The picture caption was amended on 22 December 2015.

The demonstrators adopted a sunflower as the symbol of their movement and this month\u2019s elections will be a significant test of its strength. \u201cFor the past three years, we have been playing around Europe, the US and Japan and we have only met our Taiwanese fans on protests. We felt it was now time, at this key moment in Taiwan\u2019s politics, that we join together with our fans and get the energy going again,\u201d said Lim. \u201cIt\u2019s a show of how we support freedom of speech and to encourage our fans to all try their best over the coming year to change Taiwan for the better. There is a new political space and it will allow more and more young people to bring about real change in Taiwan.\u201d     Lim at the Download Festival, Castle Donington, in June 2011. Photograph: REX/Shutterstock    After two decades of touring the world with Chthonic \u2013 pronounced \u201cthonic\u201d \u2013 and several years as a human rights campaigner and chair of Taiwan\u2019s Amnesty International, Lim now ties back his rocker\u2019s long hair during daylight hours and wears an elegant suit. \u201cThis is the hard part,\u201d he said of his new role, \u201cgetting really involved and committing to that. But I have been very encouraged by fans and I felt I should do more than just protest, that I should enter the political process. The band have been supportive \u2013 perhaps less supportive when they realised the songwriting was drying up a bit, but supportive again when they felt that I might actually win!\u201d Already the NPP has become the third party in the country, which is now facing a crucial moment over its future as an independent state. For years, Taiwan has been locked in a two-party rivalry between the pro-China ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the Democratic Progressive party (DPP), which is pushing to maintain de facto independence. Since coming to power in 2008, the KMT under Ma Ying-Jeou has steered Taiwan ever closer to Beijing, to the dismay of many Taiwanese \u2013 particularly the younger generation, who fear increased restrictions on their freedoms. \u201cWe are a free market, a free country. There is no censorship on our music: you can promote any act in Taiwan,\u201d said Lim, whose own band is one of many acts banned from playing in China. \u201cBut there is a strong feeling of alienation, and people feel that the political decisions which are being made haven\u2019t been through any sort of democratic review process. Its not just students but a lot of citizens who feel politics have nothing to do with them. It is being decided by the president that China and Taiwan will come closer together \u2013 against people\u2019s will. \u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily want to be estranged from China, but they do want to exist as different entities. Four years ago, president Ma Ying-Jeou said he would never meet with the president of China, then he is there, shaking his hand, and without any consideration of the people\u2019s feelings. The people of Taiwan feel let down.\u201d Lim\u2019s band have gained popularity through interweaving Taiwanese classical music and traditional instruments, as well as language, into their music and through lyrics which often incorporate national folklore. China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 when, as the Communists swept to power, the defeated Nationalist government fled to the island. China insists that other nations cannot have official relations with both countries at once, which has led to the diplomatic isolation of Taiwan. However, Taiwan has firm links with the US, from which it buys a great deal of its arms. Despite China\u2019s efforts to blackball the country, Taiwan has become one of Asia\u2019s big success stories as one of the world\u2019s top producers of computer technology. Whether Lim wins his seart in the election or not next month, he may need to hang on to the suit: in order to crowdfund this weekend\u2019s free concert, Chthonic have already auctioned off their stage costumes, which will be sent out \u2013 unwashed \u2013 to the keenest of their fans."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/dec/29/robot-revolution-conspiracy-theories-new-year", "publicationDate": "2015-12-29T15:30:43Z", "tags": [], "sentences": ["In Taiwan, voters are preparing for an election this month."], "title": "Inside the 1 January edition", "article": "It\u2019s a funny time of year, the gap between Christmas and the new year. In many parts of the world, things stutter, shutter and slow. The pace of news can feel less frantic. It\u2019s as if the world itself is taking a moment for quiet reflection before annual renewal. Still, there\u2019s a newspaper to produce! And it can be challenging at this time of year to find a front-page lead. So I was pleased to see a piece penned by tech-savvy journalist Charles Arthur about the robot revolution. Did paranoia and panic about AI peak in 2015? And, if so, what\u2019s next as technology and artificial intelligence reframe the legal and ethical debates in this realm? Arthur\u2019s well-informed article sits comfortably on the front page as we hurtle through a decade of change. There\u2019s lots of coverage in this edition from Asia, where the Christmas break takes less of a toll. From Tokyo, there was quite surprising news that Japan and South Korea have reconciled over the issue of second world war sex slaves. Long a stumbling block to improved relations, an apology by the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is meant to acknowledge and compensate, and allow both nations to move on. Japan also passed its biggest-ever defence budget, with an eye on China. We bring you both stories. In Taiwan, voters are preparing for an election this month. We meet the heavy metal rocker who wants a seat in parliament. From Bangkok, meanwhile, the military junta releases a public opinion poll that shows some 99% of Thais are happy with its rule. So, all good then! In Europe, an election in Spain yielded a stalemate. We consider the implications in full in our Comment section. In Poland, the government faced criticism after the president enacted constitutional measures described by many as authoritarian. From the Middle East, Iran offered to \u201cjoin hands\u201d with the west in the fight against Islamic State, and western interests focused, yet again, on Helmand province in Afghanistan, where the Taliban is showing renewed strength. From North America, we return to our series on America\u2019s poorest towns (having taken a break from this in our expanded 18 December edition). Our third instalment visits the Texas border townships where the American dream seems nothing but a fantasy. In Britain, flooding in the north has dominated the news as the rain just keeps on coming. We look at the impact. We also take in thoughts on the UK economy for the months ahead. The Comment pages consider conspiracy theories, kitchen gadgets, libraries and the power of print. And your contributions on the Reply page challenge and question, as always, on subjects as varied as the US elections and relationship therapy. We\u2019re always happy to receive your letters for publication, which you can email to us by clicking here. The deeper-read Review takes a look at the Louvre, reimagined in Abu Dhabi. We profile the finance minister of Greece, who is a quiet architect of the hard road ahead. And we consider the impact of a weak Canadian currency on the winter flight to the US of that country\u2019s snowbirds, a term for the folks seeking to escape a (usually) frozen north. Books, culture and diversions round out the offering, touching on Shakespeare, colonial art and the sound made by falling rain, from patter to drumbeat to fizz (don\u2019t you just love Nature watch?).

Iran and the western powers reached a landmark agreement on circumscribing Tehran\u2019s controversial nuclear programme. Israel was unhappy, as were Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states \u2013 but most of the rest of the world breathed a deep sigh of relief. The year brought signs of progress \u2013 at long last \u2013 on the global effort to fight climate change, after negotiators from nearly 200 countries signed up to an ambitious deal to limit temperature rise. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel inspired many across Europe by opening her country\u2019s borders to Middle Eastern refugees, at considerable cost to her personal political position. From Argentina to Myanmar, where Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi led an opposition landslide election victory ending absolute army rule, several countries enjoyed an overdue fresh start. In China, the Communist party finally revoked its oppressive one-child policy. And in Havana and Washington DC, the flags of the former arch-foes were hoisted once again following the restoration of diplomatic relations. But it was also a year of many more frightening and tragic events. From the ungoverned spaces of northern Nigeria and eastern Syria to the cruel shores of Greece and Turkey, from the streets of Paris to the holiday resorts of Tunisia and Egypt, from the waters of the South China Sea to the icy sea-lanes of the North Atlantic, 2015 was a year of tumult, terror and transition. More than ever, it was a year of living dangerously. Conflicts and confrontations The year saw the coming of age, in the worst possible sense, of Islamic State (Isis) and those who claim to be inspired or directed by the terrorist group.  Isis\u2019s expanding reach brought mass murder to Kuwait, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Tunisia and Paris. In the French capital the year began with an attack on a kosher supermarket by a man who had declared allegiance to Isis (the Charlie Hebdo attacks were claimed by an al-Qaida affiliate in Yemen), and drew to a close amid the carnage of another, even more murderous assault in the French capital.      Tributes, candles and flowers at a memorial outside Le Carillon cafe, one of the sites of the coordinated terrorist attacks in Paris in November. Photograph: Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty    Meanwhile its gross depredations in its self-declared caliphate in northern Syria and Iraq continued largely unchecked despite intensified bombing by a US-led multinational coalition, reinforced in December by Britain.  Growing mayhem sparked urgent debate in western capitals about the radicalisation of young European Muslims, the global spread of jihadi ideology, increased state security and surveillance powers, the need for a settlement of Syria\u2019s civil war, and the desirability or otherwise of expanded military intervention on the ground.  Two things, at least, became clear: in the short term, the international community remains badly divided over exactly what to do about Isis\u2019s reign of terror; and in the longer term a way has to be found of defusing the Sunni Muslim revolt that has been building across the Arab world since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.  The year saw a range of sometimes related, similarly dangerous conflicts in Nigeria, where Boko Haram Islamists attacked Muslims and Christians alike; in Libya, where post-Gaddafi chaos deepened; and in Afghanistan, where fears increased of a Taliban and al-Qaida comeback following Nato\u2019s withdrawal. Tensions rose in the East and South China Seas, where China\u2019s maritime expansionism and military build-up encountered strengthening but so far non-violent US resistance.      A military parade in Pyongyang, North Korea, marking the 70th anniversary of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party in October. Photograph: KNS/AFP/Getty Images    Japan, in particular, expressed concern about Beijing\u2019s ambitions, which include the building of artificial islands and air strips on disputed South China Sea reefs, and stepped up its own defence spending.  With presidential elections due in January in Taiwan, which China regards as a breakaway province, and with China rejecting a Philippines bid for international legal arbitration, regional stresses and strains look set to increase in 2016.  Elsewhere in east Asia there were signs of a mild thaw in relations between Japan and South Korea in the face of the common menace posed by North Korea. Kim Jong-un, Pyongyang\u2019s podgy panjandrum, purged his officials, threatened Seoul with a blitzkrieg, and warned the US it could be hit \u201cany time\u201d by his nuclear weapons and missiles. In eastern Ukraine, in contrast, tensions reduced after Russian-backed secessionists reluctantly accepted the Minsk peace accord negotiated by Angela Merkel.  In South Sudan, meanwhile, a dreadful civil war entered its third year amid the failure of successive ceasefire deals. Ethnic cleansing, child soldier recruitment and mass rape were among horrors spawned by a conflict that has displaced 2.3 million people, left 4.6 million in need of emergency food aid, and killed tens of thousands. Now, the UN is warning of a \u201cconcrete risk of famine\u201d.  All these conflict zones remain active and potentially volatile as 2016 dawns. Emergencies and extremists Europe confronted its biggest existential challenge since the darkest days of the cold war as the steady flow of refugees from internecine war, political unrest, economic failure and climate change in the Middle East, south Asia and Africa turned into an apparently unstoppable torrent of human misery.  By year\u2019s end, Germany alone was close to a figure of 1 million new arrivals in 2015, mostly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Having bravely opened Germany\u2019s borders as a matter of humanitarian principle, Merkel was under growing pressure to shut the door as her poll ratings plunged.

Photograph: Armend Nimani/AFP/Getty Images    Sweden, a traditional haven for asylum seekers, has already done so, while others, notably Hungary, Poland, Croatia and Slovenia, started building frontier walls in a return to the pre-1989 era. Further afield, fear of Islamist terrorism and ugly anti-Muslim prejudice brought shameful calls in the US, a nation built by immigrants, for an outright ban or forced registration of all Muslims.  Driven by increasingly angry, public disagreements and a shambolic official response, the migrant crisis threatened to destabilise or even break apart the EU. Voter support for xenophobic, nationalist and far right parties increased in France, Poland, Denmark, Britain and Germany. This instability looks certain to continue in to 2016, fed by a continuing refugee influx and rising extremism.  In Greece, unchecked migration compounded the extraordinary difficulties arising from the country\u2019s near bankruptcy. For a time in 2015 it seemed Athens, under its new leftwing government, would crash out of the euro, triggering a wider currency and market collapse. A last-minute compromise was found. But the crushing debt burden on southern European states was not removed, only temporarily eased. As for that other emergency \u2013 the one facing the whole world, climate change \u2013 a key country remained out of step. Even as it launched a global solar energy initiative, India insisted it would continue its rapid expansion of coal-fired power stations, placing economic development for its 1.25 billion people ahead of environmental responsibility.      Demonstrators wear heads of world leaders during the Paris climate summit. Photograph: Yoan Valat/EPA    Eighteen months after his election, Narendra Modi, India\u2019s nationalist prime minister, remains a divisive figure. But after his ruling party suffered a stunning election defeat in November in Bihar, India\u2019s third most populous state \u2013 a vote he had called a referendum on his premiership \u2013 it appeared Modi\u2019s popular appeal could be on the wane.  Democrats and dictators Democratic governance had a mixed year. Canadian voters turned their backs on a decade of Conservative rule, electing Justin Trudeau, age 43, son of the late Pierre, as prime minister. This was despite, or perhaps because of, his unconventional policy platform that included legalising cannabis and ending Canadian military involvement in Syria and Iraq. Speaking at the Commonwealth summit in Malta, the Queen, age 89, complained Trudeau made her feel old. At the other end of the world, Australia\u2019s loquacious prime minister, Tony Abbott, was ousted in an internal party coup, without the benefit of a national vote. Few tears were shed over his sudden departure, especially not by would-be immigrants held in offshore asylum camps that have besmirched Australia\u2019s international reputation.  In Turkey, two general elections in 2015 finally produced the result ordained by the country\u2019s strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. In the first vote, in June, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ruling party inadvertently lost its overall majority, due largely to a surge of support for a pro-Kurdish party. Erdo\u011fan responded by tearing up the ceasefire with the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) and encouraging \u2013 so said his critics \u2013 a sense of national insecurity. It seemed to work. Frightened voters were shaken in particular by the deadliest bomb attack in Turkey\u2019s recent history which Erdo\u011fan condemned as a terrorist act and a \u201cheinous attack on our unity\u201d. His Justice and Development party won back its majority in November.

Photograph: Burhan Ozbilici/AP    Argentina experienced what observers called a transformative election. Victory for Mauricio Macri, mayor of Buenos Aires, brought an end to more than decade of dirigiste and bombastic Peronist rule.  In Guatemala, a former comedian, Jimmy Morales, won the presidency on an anti-corruption platform, following his jailed predecessor\u2019s disgrace. Unlike Trudeau in Canada, one of his first acts was to restate his opposition to decriminalising narcotics.  Thanks in large part to Pope Francis, who made a ground-breaking visit to Havana in September, 2015 was the year Cuba finally came in from the cold. And amid widely-shared relief, Iran\u2019s theocratic leadership at last approved a nuclear deal with the western powers, meaning trade and other sanctions may soon be lifted. The deal was seen as a fillip for the country\u2019s quasi-moderate leader, President Hassan Rouhani. But Iran\u2019s record on human rights and free speech remains dismal, and its hoped-for cooperation on ending the Syrian war has yet to materialise in concrete form.      A protester waves a Burundian flag during an anti-government demonstration in Bujumbura. Photograph: Dai Kurokawa/EPA    Matters proceeded much less smoothly in Burundi where President Pierre Nkurunziza unwisely insisted on seeking a third consecutive term in office, despite a constitutional prohibition and public opposition. Predictably, his power grab provoked worsening violence and mass flight.  In Russia, meanwhile, the rule of Vladimir Putin continued intact despite the damaging impact of western sanctions, imposed after his annexation of Crimea, and spending cuts necessitated by falling oil revenues. Notwithstanding the absence of free speech and open debate, Putin could face trouble in 2016 if the economy continues to contract. The president stepped up his confrontational policy of sending Russian bombers and submarines to probe western defences in the North Atlantic and Baltic in 2015, part of his vainglorious attempt to re-establish Russia as a global superpower. He also intervened militarily in Syria on the side of that country\u2019s dictator, President Bashar al-Assad. But Putin received a comeuppance in November, when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane it said had violated its airspace.      Chinese President Xi Jinping, accompanied by Prince Philip, inspects the guard of honour during a ceremonial welcome in London. Photograph: Xinhua/Landov/Barcroft Media    In China, home of the world\u2019s last great Communist dictatorship, President Xi Jinping tightened his grip on the organs of power and on media and civil society organisations, attempting to compensate for an economic downturn by increasing centralised control. This, too, could spell trouble down the road. David Cameron\u2019s obsequious treatment of Xi during a state visit to the UK drew the contempt of human rights campaigners.  In the US, the 2016 presidential election drew inexorably closer, with Hillary Clinton emerging as the Democrats\u2019 most likely nominee to replace Barack Obama. On the Republican side, a series of often raucous and unpleasant televised candidates debates showed how far the GOP has drifted to the right. The racist and misogynistic antics of Donald Trump, a property developer who topped party polls, may have permanently tainted the Republican cause in the eyes of mainstream voters.  In New Zealand, finally, nothing much happened of political significance in 2015, although there was a noisy parliamentary bust-up over male attitudes to sexual assault. The untimely death of Jonah Lomu, one of rugby union\u2019s all-time greats, was widely mourned. Oh, and the All Blacks won the Rugby World Cup \u2013 again."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/30/sherlock-enters-new-year-as-global-tv-phenomenon", "publicationDate": "2015-12-30T18:28:07Z", "tags": ["Sherlock", "Benedict Cumberbatch", "Martin Freeman", "Crime drama", "Doctor Who", "Drama", "Steven Moffat", "Russell T Davies", "Television", "Television & radio", "Culture", "UK news", "Fantasy", "Media"], "sentences": ["It is now shown in more than 200 countries, including Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, the US, Australia and New Zealand, and has also proved wildly popular in China, where 98 million people were estimated to have watched the last series, despite it only being available online."], "title": "Sherlock enters new year as global TV phenomenon", "article": "It has become one of the BBC\u2019s most successful creations, a reimagining of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s masterful detective and the courageous military doctor who records his adventures in London\u2019s criminal underworld. And on Friday, Sherlock looks set to cement its reputation as a global phenomenon, responsible for propelling the screen careers of Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman into the stratosphere.  The New Year\u2019s Day feature-length episode, The Abominable Bride, returns the contemporary adaptation back to its Victorian roots and will for the first time be aired in the UK and the US on the same day, as well as in cinemas around the world. The special reflects how Sherlock has joined the ranks of event television alongside the likes of Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad and Mad Men, attracting an average of 12 million viewers for the third series in 2014.     Sherlock is a man who\u2019s an outsider, who is incredibly efficient, but also has his weaknesses and comeuppances  Benedict Cumberbatch     The BBC said in excess of 13 million people were expected to watch the 1 January episode, challenging the Downton Abbey finale and the Queen\u2019s Christmas Day address as the most popular television during the festive period.  Sherlock was an immediate hit when it was first broadcast in 2010. Four years ago, its first New Year\u2019s Day episode titillated viewers with the tale of a whip-wielding dominatrix who had compromising photos of a minor royal on her phone. This was a modern twist too far for some viewers, prompting 100 complaints. But the programme has continued to break viewing records and garner accolades. It is now shown in more than 200 countries, including Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, the US, Australia and New Zealand, and has also proved wildly popular in China, where 98 million people were estimated to have watched the last series, despite it only being available online. In the UK, nearly 10 million viewers tuned in to the first episode of series three in 2014 to find out how Holmes managed to fake his rooftop suicide, a plot turn that inspired countless fan theories and still attracts scrawled messages of support outside St Bartholomew\u2019s hospital in central London.  The show has also provided its creators, Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, with their second hit series for the corporation. Moffat took over as the executive producer of Doctor Who from Russell T Davies in 2010, with Gatiss working as a regular writer of the long-running sci-fi series.  Their interpretation of Sherlock has arguably proved a bigger hit with critics and fans than their handling of Doctor Who, which has seen its domestic audience decline amid complaints about Moffat\u2019s convoluted metafictional narratives. Both shows have around 5m likes on Facebook, suggesting comparative international appeal. But the detective drama is not as lucrative for the BBC as Doctor Who, which is made in-house, because it is made by Hartswood Films, run by Beryl Vertue, mother of Sherlock producer Sue Vertue, who is married to Moffat.  Its two lead actors have become superstars. Cumberbatch, who plays Holmes, starred in Star Trek sequel Into Darkness in 2013 and will play the lead in Marvel\u2019s Dr Strange next year, while Freeman, star of Peter Jackson\u2019s The Hobbit trilogy, will take a role in another blockbuster comic adaptation, Captain America: Civil War. Asked about Sherlock\u2019s success earlier this year, Cumberbatch said Holmes had always had global appeal. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a phenomenon tied in with our success. I think it\u2019s to do with Conan Doyle\u2019s extraordinary invention which has a universal appeal to all nationalities,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a man who\u2019s an outsider, who\u2019s intelligent, who doesn\u2019t tolerate mediocrity, who is incredibly efficient, but also has his weaknesses and comeuppances. You never know where it\u2019s going to lead \u2013 there\u2019s an endless amount of potential adventure.\u201d Production of new episodes is expected to begin in the spring of 2016. Moffat has said \u2013 half-jokingly \u2013 that the show will \u201ccontinue until Benedict [Cumberbatch] gets too famous\u201d."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/dec/31/guardian-travels-year-in-instagram-2015", "publicationDate": "2015-12-31T10:00:48Z", "tags": ["Travel photography", "Travel", "Photography", "Art and design"], "sentences": ["@paulratje, an American photojournalist based in Taiwan, captured the historic events."], "title": "Guardian Travel's year in Instagram: 2015", "article": "January     We started the year with @ventureforthphoto doing a takeover for us at the annual Bishwa Itjema religious festival, \u201cwhich draws millions of attendees to the northern Dhaka suburb of Tongi, many of them arriving and departing on heavily loaded trains, which are truly an astounding sight\u201d.

This shot by @mansoreh.motamedi shows an Iranian Muslim family using a selfie stick to take a group photograph on a beach by the Caspian sea, northern Iran      @matteocartaphoto, a teacher, traveller and photographer based in China, shared a rare insight into the Naadam festival in Mongolia, a major holiday featuring the three sporting passions of Mongolians: horse racing, wrestling and archery.   September     In September, Melbourne-based photojournalist @francescovicenzi was in Pokhra, Nepal to witness new constitution celebrations. \u201cThe newly signed constitution was seven years in the making and follows months of political unrest. While celebrated in major towns, it has left some minority groups unhappy.\u201d    October     October is all about the beer in Bavaria. @katia_mi_ shared this shot from Oktoberfest: the largest beer festival and funfair in the world, held in Munich since 1810.    November     November saw Myanmar\u2019s first national vote since a nominally civilian government was introduced in 2011, ending nearly 50 years of military rule. @paulratje, an American photojournalist based in Taiwan, captured the historic events. \u201cThis shot was taken in Mandalay and shows a group of nuns crammed aboard a bus, seemingly joking around.

Framed by the Franz\u00f6sischer Dom, the Konzerthaus and the Deutscher Dom, a small tent city with more than 1,000 strings of light appears like magic each year in this centrally-located square.\u201d "}]}
