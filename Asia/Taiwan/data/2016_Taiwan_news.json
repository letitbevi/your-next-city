We produce hundreds of stories on any given day and a list of the top 20 most-read pieces of the year simply doesn\u2019t reflect the variety, ambition, nuance and scale of the complete range of our journalism. But the simple fact is that lists are terribly interesting, particularly when they tell us what\u2019s interesting to other people. And so here we\u2019re presenting the most popular pieces we published in 2015, organised by page views, and then by total attention time.     Our live blog of the much anticipated Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao fight was widely read.

Still, the scale is interesting. Four of the top 20 are on that subject and the two pieces at the top of the list exceeded 7m and 6m page views respectively. One tenth of the top 100 is made up of articles on the same subject.     Ed Miliband\u2019s Labour received a drubbing at the polls this year, changing the political landscape somewhat. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA    Format is also interesting. Seven of the top 20 were live blogs on major breaking or rolling news stories. The eighth live blog was focused on one of the most searched for sporting events of the year: Floyd Mayweather\u2019s victory over Manny Pacquiao. If we look at the top 100 pieces by page views, almost a third are in the live blog format. In every case, search engines are the crucial means for readers to find their way to the journalism.

It\u2019s fascinating to see the ways in which this list differs from the first. Jonathan Franklin\u2019s long piece on Salvador Alvarenga, an extract from his novel 438 Days, has ratcheted up an extraordinary 148,000 hours of active attention time since its launch in November, but doesn\u2019t appear anywhere in the top 20 for page views.      The Chicago police department has had a torrid year after several shooting incidents and a series of Guardian investigations into black sites for interrogations. Photograph: Charles Rex Arbogast/AP    Its attention time is a testament to the power of a great story well told,echoed in the appearance of Jon Ronson\u2019s piece on the shaming of Lindsey Stone; Lindy West on how she confronted her troll; and Anna Erelle on going undercover as a jihadi girlfriend. The list is completed by Spencer Ackerman\u2019s outstanding exclusive reporting on the Chicago police department\u2019s off-the-books interrogation compound in Homan Square, the first part of Chris McGreal\u2019s heartbreaking series of reports from the poorest towns in the US and a piece that could only work digitally: an interactive photographic portrait of the sites scarred by the American civil war. Beyond the top 20 There\u2019s a wealth of interest beyond the very top of these lists. It was wonderful to see the live blog of the Women\u2019s World Cup final register over 1.3m page views. It was even more wonderful to see the Japanese language live blog of the same event hit almost half a million.

With the help of our readers we built the most comprehensive record of the deadly use of force in the US: a real high point in terms of reach, engagement and participation in journalism. In early October the impact of the work became clear when it was specifically mentioned by the head of the FBI at a summit on reducing violent crime convened by the US Justice Department. And then there are the glorious oddities and particulars: the Christian group whose confident prediction of the end of the world proved wrong (\u201cSince it is now 8 October it is now obvious that we were incorrect regarding the world\u2019s ending on the 7th\u201d); a five-star review for a film you may have heard of; the fall of Jeremy Clarkson; the neural network that throws up hallucinatory images; and the Taiwanese boy who punched a hole through a 350-year-old, $1.5m painting.

Of course the digital audience online is vast. And of course that means that popular topics often rise to the top. But for our audience, whether they come directly to us to find out what\u2019s going on in the world, or whether they\u2019re using Google to look for something specific, or whether they\u2019re discovering pieces shared organically or through our branded accounts on Facebook and Twitter, there\u2019s no doubting that what they really want is the very best journalism they can find, in whatever form it takes.

BBC Worldwide said 1.7 million people in China turned out to see the feature-length episode on Monday, with Deadline reporting it took $5.39m (\u00a33.67m) at the box office. The run in China is part of a deal struck between BBC Worldwide and Shanghai Media Group to show the episode, plus an extra 25 minutes of footage not shown on TV.  In Korea, box office receipts reportedly hit $5m on 735 screens, with the BBC saying it outsold Star Wars: The Force Awakens four to one.  The special \u2013 which took Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman back to the 19th century \u2013 also played in UK cinemas on Friday night, with 18,500 fans turning up despite the episode airing at the same time on BBC1.

Related: Sherlock draws largest festive TV audience    The BBC1 broadcast on Friday evening, timed to coincide with the US debut on PBS, attracted 8.4 million viewers, making it the most watched show over the festive period. The fourth series is due to start filming later this year. Sherlock has followed Doctor Who in becoming a global hit for the BBC. In China, 98 million people tuned in to the third series in 2014, and the show has hundreds of millions of viewers across more than 200 territories. BBC Worldwide head of drama brands Sally De St Croix said: \u201cBBC Worldwide are thrilled that fans across the world have been enjoying the Victorian-themed Sherlock special.  \u201cFollowing on from a strong performance on BBC1, the show has now seen multi-million dollar success at the Korean and Chinese box offices \u2013 an outstanding achievement for a British TV show.\u201d Both shows have also led to world tours, though many Sherlock fans have had to settle for co-creators Stephen Moffat and Mark Gatiss as Freeman and Cumberbatch have found it difficult to take time out from busy filming schedules. However, while Doctor Who is made in-house by the BBC and has become BBC Worldwide\u2019s best-selling show, the corporation\u2019s commercial arm only acts as an agent for Sherlock production company Hartswood, which is run by Beryl Vertue, mother of Sherlock producer Sue Vertue, who is married to Moffat."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/07/chinese-share-trading-halt-sends-cold-ripples-across-asian-markets", "publicationDate": "2016-01-07T08:15:59Z", "tags": ["Asia Pacific", "World news", "China", "Thailand", "Australia news", "Japan", "Malaysia", "New Zealand"], "sentences": ["The Thai SET fell 24.7 points, nearly 2%, at the opening of trade and stock indexes in Singapore and Taiwan lost more than 2%."], "title": "Chinese share trading halt sends cold ripples across Asian markets", "article": "Asian markets fell to a three-month low on Thursday after Chinese shares tumbled more than 7% and triggered a market closure while Beijing accelerated a devaluation of the yuan, raising the spectre of a regional currency war.

Related: China share trading halted after market plunges 7% in opening minutes    China\u2019s new automatic \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d mechanism tripped 30 minutes after trading opened on Thursday, the second time this week that the device, intended to bring stability to the markets following steep drops, has been deployed. Beijing responded by speeding up the devaluation of the yuan to its lowest level in nearly five years, a move aimed to boost the economy by making Chinese exports cheaper. The People\u2019s Bank of China set the official midpoint rate on the yuan at 6.5646 per dollar, the weakest since March 2011. But the move puts pressure on China\u2019s Asian neighbours to follow suit and keep their exports competitively priced, analysts warn, a spiralling currency battle that led in part to the Asian financial crisis in 1997. \u201cWhen we look at 2016, the outlook for the yuan is a major concern not only for China but for all countries,\u201d the chief Asia economist for IHS Global Insight, Rajiv Biswas, said. \u201cBecause obviously if the yuan goes down significantly against the US dollar, you are back in a world of currency wars.\u201d An index that tracks Asia\u2019s 10 most-used currencies excluding the yen, the Asia Dollar Index, fell 0.3%. The Australian dollar, often used during trades with China, fell by half a US cent to a two-month low and the New Zealand dollar plunged to a one-month low of $0.6615 to the US dollar.   Related: Denials and devaluation as China's currency tumbles to five-year low    \u201cMany countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia watch the Chinese-US dollar exchange rate very closely because they are competing against Chinese products,\u201d Biswas said. \u201cSo many Asian countries and other countries around the world would face a lot of pressure if the yuan goes down significantly against the US dollar from where it is now.\u201d On Monday, the first day China employed the \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d, it was tripped by a 7% drop. On Tuesday, China intervened, spending almost $20bn (\u00a313.6bn) offering cheap borrowing facilities. But the Thursday drop set off the circuit breaker again and Beijing intervened in the currency. The CEO of Singapore\u2019s DBS Bank Ltd, a banking and financial services company, told the Business Times that 2016 would be a year of \u201ccurrency wars\u201d.

Last month, Laureate Education, a global education company with $4.5bn in annual revenues, became the largest certified B Corp, joining Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, Patagonia, Seventh Generation and Warby Parker, among many others. B Lab, the nonprofit that administers the B Corp certification, is also raising its own profile, with plans to help launch a media company that will spread the word about the movement. B the Change Media, which recently raised $2m in startup capital, will launch a quarterly print magazine and website this summer, and plans to organize events for socially and environmentally responsible firms. All this is part of an effort to drive \u201ca culture shift to redefine success in business\u201d, according to Jay Coen Gilbert, chair of B the Change Media. B Lab, founded in 2006, wants to become for business what Fair Trade is to coffee or Leed is to buildings \u2013 a signal to consumers of a more sustainable way of doing business. \u201cWe want all companies to measure and manage their impact \u2013 all companies,\u201d says Gilbert, who met me recently at B Lab\u2019s headquarters, in Wayne, a small town outside Philadelphia. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to work with a local farmers\u2019 market. We\u2019re thrilled to work with the Fortune 500.\u201d From this unlikely hub, the B Corps idea has spread far and wide. There are now 1,498 certified B Corps companies in 42 countries, including Australia, Bulgaria, Ghana and Taiwan. To gain the certification, all have had to meet \u201crigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency\u201d, according to B Lab. They answer questions about energy, waste and water use, worker compensation, diversity and transparency. Most B Corps are small to mid-sized privately-held companies, but bigger firms are showing interest. The French food company Group Danone said it would work with B Lab to develop ways to make B Corps certification more manageable and meaningful for large, publicly-traded multinational corporations that are engaged in a variety of businesses in different geographies. B Lab also works with private and public companies that want to become \u201cbenefit corporations\u201d, a legal status that requires them to serve not only shareholders but also stakeholders such as workers and consumers. The terminology is unavoidably confusing, but here\u2019s one way to think about it: B Corps must eventually meet the same legal standards as benefit corporations, but benefit corporations need not meet the same verified performance standards as B Corps. The start of a big idea Like most big ideas, B Lab started small. Gilbert and Houlahan, who previously worked together at a startup footwear company called AND 1, co-founded B Lab with Andrew Kassoy, a private equity investor a decade ago. The first 19 B Corps, which were announced a year later in Berkeley, included Method, New Leaf Paper and King Arthur Flour. To become certified as a B Corp, companies must complete an assessment of their impact in five categories: environment, workers, customers, community and governance. They must also earn a verified minimum score of 80 out of a possible 200 points. That may sound low, but 53 is the median score for a typical business, according to Gilbert. The assessment has evolved over time, with input from companies and an independent advisory council. Certified B Corps make their scores public. Once companies clear the social and environmental review by B Lab, they have a year or two to take whatever legal steps \u2013 a reincorporation as a benefit corporation or change to their bylaws \u2013 are necessary to require their directors and officers to consider all stakeholders, and not just shareholders, when making decisions. Under the new structure, shareholders have the right to hold directors and officers accountable to this broader mission. This legal requirement has, so far, been a roadblock for public companies in the US. \u201cA public company has unique challenges,\u201d says Rick Alexander, a veteran corporate lawyer who joined B Lab last year. \u201cTraditional corporate law, especially in the Anglo-American system, is really an obstacle.\u201d Large, conventional firms, usually structured as C Corporations, are required by law to owe their primary allegiance to shareholders, Alexander argues \u2013 although others disagree. To help create support for publicly-held B Corps, Alexander has been meeting with institutional owners such as Black Rock, Fidelity and T Rowe Price, and trying to make the argument that being a benefit corporation will over time build more value for all stakeholders, including stockholders. He notes that venture capitalists have been willing to invest in privately-held B Corps \u2013 a sign that they believe that B Corps status won\u2019t put their returns at risk. How institutional investors will respond to B Corps should become more evident soon. Laureate, which is certified and privately-held, has an initial public offering planned this year. Etsy, which is certified and went public last spring, needs to get shareholder approval to change its legal status if it wants to remain a B Corp. Meanwhile, Unilever, with Group Danone, has agreed to work with B Lab and others to make the B Corp status workable for multinational companies with numerous lines of businesses, products, subsidiaries and workers in different countries with different wage scales, among other things. No green washing Companies point to several advantages of becoming B Corps. Jeff Mendelsohn, the founder of New Leaf Paper, which makes environmentally-friendly paper goods, says his connections to others in the B Corps community have helped drive sales.  Santiago Halty, whose company, Senda Athletics, makes Fair Trade soccer balls, also cites the value of the B Corps community, saying he has turned to other B Corps leaders for advice on sales, marketing and distribution. \u201cB Lab has done a wonderful job of connecting people,\u201d he says. Halty also believes his certification as a B Corp helped get him access to Target\u2019s Made to Matter program, which showcases companies with social missions. \u201cIn a time of green washing, having that third-party verification is key.\u201d As for B Lab\u2019s new venture into media, Gilbert and Bryan Welsh say it will be independent of B Lab but will serve as a hub for people who care about how business can change the world for the better. No other outlet focuses exclusively on the social and environmental impact of business, they say.  \u201cWe\u2019re not about B Corporations,\u201d Welsh said. \u201cOur goal is to tell credible, authentic and compelling stories about businesses that make a positive difference.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/jan/08/open-data-ecosystem-change-2016", "publicationDate": "2016-01-08T16:10:43Z", "tags": ["Media & Tech Network", "Big data"], "sentences": ["In 2015 the EU launched the world\u2019s first international data portal, the Chinese government pledged to make state data public, and the UK lost its open data crown to Taiwan."], "title": "Open data set to reshape charity and activism in 2016", "article": "In 2015 the EU launched the world\u2019s first international data portal, the Chinese government pledged to make state data public, and the UK lost its open data crown to Taiwan. Troves of data were unlocked by governments around the world last year, but the usefulness of much of that data is still to be determined by the civic groups, businesses and governments who use it. So what\u2019s in the pipeline? And how will the open data ecosystem grow in 2016? We asked the experts. 1. Data will be seen as infrastructure Heather Savory, deputy national statistician for Data Capability, Office for National Statistics Last year was the year that the data revolution got serious. Data plays a key role in our everyday lives, whether it is using open data on travel times to work out the most efficient way to get somewhere; a small business using data to inform their expansion; or central government making-better informed policy and operational decisions. This year will be the year when data is seen as infrastructure, the building blocks of everything we do. We will continue to see the benefits that data brings, while the proliferation of data being created and made open for everyone to use makes 2016 an exciting year. Statisticians, data scientists, and others working across the government statistical service and Office for National Statistics will increasingly draw out more efficient, better statistics, using a variety of data sources, which will help us all make better decisions. 2015 is the year when the data revolution took off. 2016 has the potential for us to show the world how much better Britain can be as a result. 2. Journalists, charities and civil society bodies will embrace open data Hetan Shah, executive director, the Royal Statistical Society This will be the year we see the demand side for open data really take off. In particular we are seeing the rise of data journalism \u2013 the quality of entries we get for our statistical excellence in journalism awards are getting better and better. Civil society bodies are also becoming more data literate. There will be more fact checking than ever before, with bodies such as Full Fact using open data sources to hold government to account. Charities will use open data to link together the numbers on issues that are of concern to us all such as climate change, social mobility and health, helping us to gain a better understanding of our world. 3. Activists will take it upon themselves to create data Pavel Richter, chief executive, Open Knowledge International We will see a move from supply-driven to demand-driven open data. Activists will use new tools and methods to create data where it is missing. For a long time, open data was about availability and accessibility of (governmental) datasets. And as can be seen in the Global Open Data Index, there is still a lot to do in this regards. But I see a shift towards a more demand-driven approach happening: working with NGOs in different areas previously outside the classical scope of open data, we identify their needs for open data and help them to satisfy them. What started with Openstreetmap and Wikipedia is happening all over the place now: instead of waiting for corporations or governments to open their data vaults, communities and activists create and curate the data they want and need on their own. 4. Data illiteracy will come at a heavy price Sir Nigel Shadbolt, principal, Jesus College, Oxford, professorial research fellow in computer science, University of Oxford and chairman and co-founder of the Open Data Institute Data literacy will become paramount for companies, governments and individuals. For example, appreciating the differences between open, closed, shared, personal, non-personal and variously anonymised data will become essential. Different types of data complement each other. Personal data integrated with non-personal, open data can deliver great applications in areas such as transport, retail, health, etc. However, these different forms of data in different contexts will have different terms of use. Understanding how to blend and integrate them is fundamental. Not least because the new general European data regulations are almost certain to be approved by the EU parliament later this month. They will become law across the EU from 2018. There will be more rigorous regulations for getting consent to collect data, increasing the age of consent from 13 to 16 years old, removing information from company servers when Right to be Forgotten requests are granted, requiring companies to tell EU authorities if a data breach occurs within 72 hours of its occurrence. Failure to comply could result in companies being fined up to 4% of their global revenue. Data illiteracy will come at a heavy price. 5. We\u2019ll create better tools to build a web of data Dr Elena Simperl, associate professor, electronics and computer science, University of Southampton, coordinator of Odine (sponsors of the Guardian\u2019s editorially independent coverage of the open data economy) A few years ago the open data debate was all about publishing: should data be published openly? How do we protect people\u2019s privacy? What datasets should we release and how? Then as governments bought into the idea, we started thinking about reuse, about the best ways to create added value, for the data publishers themselves, but also for others through new digital products and services. Odine is part of that trend. Looking into the future we now have a better understanding of how disruptive open data can be for innovation, but we also realise that open data is just one part of a bigger picture, in which some data will be free to be reused, but other sources will be proprietary. The technical challenges of such data ecosystems are starting to be better understood. This year I expect to see advances in the technology needed to build this \u201cweb of data\u201d, from tools to search for the data you need to interfaces to understand what the data captures, and which parts of it may need protection to preserve privacy.

The world wants our creative thinking and artistic talent. But that leading position is in jeopardy, says a report due out on Tuesday. A new emphasis on creative thinking among foreign competitors has underlined a growing threat to Britain\u2019s worldwide standing in the arts. While schools are being urged to concentrate on maths and science, much of the rest of the developed world is embarking on an \u201carts race\u201d for soft diplomatic power and creative status. The historically strong tradition of hit cultural exports across performance, art and design will not continue into the next decade if the plans of rival foreign investors come good. Countries as far away as China, South Korea and Brazil have learned from British success and are investing heavily in their creative economies, according to research carried out by BOP Consulting in collaboration with the Creative Industries Federation to mark the cultural lobbying organisation\u2019s first birthday this week. European neighbours France, Germany and Italy are doing much the same thing. China has recently made the creative industries a \u201cmain pillar\u201d of its national economy, while Taiwan has shifted its curriculum towards the encouragement of creative thinking. In the US there is also increased understanding of the significance of a cultural education, with San Francisco voting for a 50% rise in grant-funding for the San Francisco Arts Commission to secure the future of its cultural scene. Speaking before the release of the research, designer and philanthropist Sir John Sorrell, chair of the CIF, said that, while George Osborne\u2019s autumn statement had endorsed Britain\u2019s creative industries, there was no scope for complacency. \u201cOther countries now also see the economic value of culture and are investing heavily,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Chinese want things to be perceived as \u2018designed in China\u2019, not \u2018made in China\u2019.\u201d Of real concern to his federation members is the push to get the EBacc adopted in Britain for at least 90% of secondary pupils. This has no creative component, takes up the space of seven or eight GCSEs in the curriculum and so, they argue, prevents many students from furthering their artistic interests in other subjects. Last week leading actors and musicians wrote to the Times to complain about the impact of the widescale imposition of the \u201cnarrow\u201d EBacc. \u201cIn order to stay at the top we need to invest in the future, especially in creativity in schools, where the number of pupils taking design and technology has halved in the past decade,\u201d said Sorrell. \u201cThat is cutting off the skills pipeline we need for future success.\u201d The new international comparisons study, carried out by Callum Lee and Lucy Minyo of BOP Consulting for the federation, is part of The C.Report, a survey of the CIF\u2019s first year of work which is intended as a curtain-raiser to further studies of levels of foreign investment and sponsorship of the arts. John Kampfner, chief executive of CIF, believes that Britain\u2019s artistic pre-eminence has been built on sustained levels of investment from the lottery and from government, underpinned by creative education in schools. \u201cBut we risk putting our hard-earned reputation and economic vibrancy at risk if we undermine the infrastructure that supports a thriving arts and creative industries sector, with creative education currently the biggest hole in central government policy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should not be possible for a school to be deemed outstanding if its students are deprived of a quality cultural education, in and out of the curriculum. A reduction in the number of pupils with creative skills can only have damaging repercussions for the creative economy.\u201d Kampfner\u2019s fears about a shrinking arts curriculum are echoed by Lizzie Crump of the Cultural Learning Alliance, who argues that government\u2019s aim to give schools more freedom has been thwarted by their weighting in favour of EBacc during a consultation period that ends on January 29. \u201cSchools and teachers really do need to be trusted. Science and technology and maths are obviously important, but we need to ensure there is an arts component in the education of students too,\u201d she said. The number of arts teachers and hours of arts teaching in British schools are both going down, Crump said. \u201cThere will be young people, of course, who are supported in the arts by their parents, but we want a gold standard of arts education for all our children.\u201d Pisa (Programme for International Student Assessment) rankings, often alluded to by government, are also about to start measuring creativity. It is ironic, Crump added, that Britain is poised to pull away from the arts just as there is a global move towards monitoring these competencies in pupils.

He has a bottle of water and a packet of lozenges for his throat. His baseball cap is pulled so low that his eyes are in shadow. Jessica the translator says: \u201cLook at the man looking out of the window. Look at the man looking out at the road. Is he suffering from worry, fear or joy of life?\u201d I stare at the director. I stare at the translator. Is the question rhetorical or are they expecting an answer? This interview is not quite five minutes old and I feel we have already wandered some way off the path. Feted by the critics, lauded by his peers, Hou makes films that pride themselves on being more poetry than prose, more fugue than symphony. He wants to kick away the bricks of conventional narrative and ride the thermals of a purely visual language. \u201cPlot,\u201d he says and shakes his head dismissively. \u201cI don\u2019t think that plot is the only way to appeal to an audience. The audience can catch the message of a film through landscape, character, details.\u201d Then he sneezes like a thunderclap and turns his gaze back to the glass.     Hou Hsiao-hsien: \u2018I am the only person I am speaking to\u2019    Hou\u2019s latest film may well stand as his ideal expression, in that it possesses the weightless, shimmering quality of a dream. Adapted from a ninth-century Tang dynasty tale, The Assassin stars Shu Qi as Yinniang, the \u201cwoman in black\u201d, scampering over rooftops and hiding out in fields of gorse. Yinniang, it transpires, is on a mission to kill Tian Ji\u2019an (Chang Chen), the governor of Weibo province, whose very presence maintains a delicate balance of power with the imperial Chinese court. But the way ahead is murky and compromised.  The assassin and her quarry share a cherished, tangled history. And while the film\u2019s basic outline leads one to expect a straightforward martial arts epic, Hou twists the genre into abstract shapes. He conjures up a whirl of inky blacks and midnight blues. It\u2019s a film to get gloriously lost inside. Watching it, I suffered from worry, fear or joy of life. The director casts an eye around his London hotel room, dabs his nose with a tissue and gently runs me through his creative process. He explains that the original story was incredibly short, about 1,000 words, but that out of this little seed grew a veritable forest. He wound up shooting 440,000ft of film (normally he shoots about 20,000) and then edited on some instinctual, semi-conscious level, pruning back and back until the motion picture emerged. He says he tried to shoot outside as much as possible (the film was predominantly shot in Hubei province), because he liked the wind, the birdsong, the way the sunlight played against the silk dresses.           The Assassin: an exclusive clip from Hou Hsiao-Hsien\u2019s martial arts epic    All the while, Hou is directing his answers to Jessica. She laughs in delight, writes them down on her pad, then relays each response with an air of funereal solemnity. The translation is excellent; it moves at lightning pace. But some of the humour has perhaps gone missing in transit. \u201cI like everything to follow a natural principle,\u201d Hou explains. \u201cPeople in a kung fu movie should not be able to fly around like birds. So the film should show the real limitations of this world, the real limitations of human beings. Because that, for me, is where the drama arises. It comes from limitations, not from freedom.\u201d He adds something further. Jessica nods her head. She says: \u201cDirector Hou excuses himself for a moment. He needs to go and use the bathroom now.\u201d   Related: The Assassin review - enigmatically refined martial arts tale baffles beautifully    The Assassin premiered at last year\u2019s Cannes film festival, where Hou wound up winning the best director prize. The recent Sight &amp; Sound critics\u2019 poll named it best picture of 2015. But where some see the film as paradise, others may balk at its lack of narrative signposts, handrails and lanterns to light the way. As such, The Assassin looks set to exasperate as many viewers as it enchants. I have a sneaking suspicion that this is just how Hou likes it. \u201cI am not shooting a film to please an audience,\u201d he insists, once he has resettled himself in his seat. \u201cI don\u2019t even make films to communicate with an audience. I am the only person who I am speaking to.\u201d  He was born in China but effectively made in Taiwan, fleeing the Chinese civil war with his parents in the late 1940s. As a child he was obsessed with Japanese films, pleading with passing strangers to escort him into the cinema. As a young man he did national service and sold electronic calculators.  His breakthrough films established him as the leading light of the Taiwanese new wave, a master of intimate human dramas that mapped out the edges of wider social upheavals. The semi-autobiographical A Time to Live, A Time to Die (1985), for instance, details the aching nostalgia within a displaced Chinese family. The award-winning A City of Sadness (1989) viewed China\u2019s postwar crackdown on Taiwan through the prism of an everyday household pitching towards tragedy.      A film to get gloriously lost inside \u2026 The Assassin    He now fears that these early films were too prescriptive, too subjective. These days he is happier letting the story tell itself. He says: \u201cJust a little earlier, we were discussing the window, we were discussing the road. Now, this scene is so ordinary that we take it for granted. But if you sit an actor at the window and have him familiarise himself with the environment, well, then something happens. Some bright, splendid, overwhelming moment that we never expected. I call it unconscious acting. And it\u2019s the only way you can catch that precious moment.\u201d  This can be tough for the performers \u2013 he realises that. \u201cI give them the scripts but I provide no instructions. They have to act by themselves. I have never rehearsed. So the actors do suffer. They suffer huge pressure.\u201d I\u2019m wondering, though, what The Assassin tells us about Hou\u2019s current relationship with China. It strikes me that he has spent his career studying his old homeland from a distance, or from an angle, as though he is unwilling to confront the issue head-on. Here, tellingly, he presents it as a fabulous kingdom of the past: outside history, blanketed in myth. Presumably this reflects his own experience of the place.     Weightless, shimmering quality \u2026 The Assassin    Hou pulls a face; he\u2019s not convinced. \u201cWhen I was relocated to Taiwan, I was just a baby, four months old, so I have no impression of China as my home. Recently [the local Chinese authorities] found my ancestor. They found that my ancestor had migrated from northern China to Guangdong province over 1,000 years ago. So Guangdong province invited me to go back to celebrate this discovery. But I refused. Because the society across the Taiwan Strait is so very different. China is another world. I can\u2019t comprehend it. I was editing A City of Sadness when Tiananmen Square happened. Me and my editor spent every day watching the TV news, crying. We forgot all about editing the actual film.\u201d Another explosive sneeze. Another glance at the window. He says: \u201cI can take the landscapes, yes, that\u2019s true. The clouds. The lakes. The mountains and the mist. But I can\u2019t shoot stories about the people of China. I can\u2019t impose my own subjective opinions on to people I don\u2019t know. I can never make a film about the relationship between Taiwan and China. That would be too much effort. I am not going to do it.\u201d              Our hour together is drawing to an end. We have wandered off the path and back again, circled around to the exit door. Hou likes to let his films go their own way, tell their own story. His interviews, too, can follow a curiously skittish and freestyle course. They unfurl at their leisure. They take on their own shape. The film-maker hauls himself to his feet and holds his hand out to shake. But Jessica remains seated. She is still scanning her notepad, checking for any loose ends she has not yet relayed and ticked off. She says: \u201cDirector Hou has never ever rehearsed. He throws his characters into a situation. He has them immerse themselves and improvise. The man at the window. That fascinates him.\u201d \u2022 The Assassin is released on 22 January."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jan/12/what-cane-toads-taught-queenslands-banana-growers-about-defeating-a-deadly-fungus", "publicationDate": "2016-01-12T01:03:12Z", "tags": ["Queensland", "Australia news", "Agriculture", "Asia Pacific", "Food & drink industry", "Food security", "Fungi", "Fruit", "Northern Territory"], "sentences": ["Banana growers in Asia have largely been forced to look on helplessly as TR4, which first emerged in Taiwan in the 1980s, spread through Indonesia, Malaysia the Philippines, China and Pakistan."], "title": "On the brink: Queensland\u2019s banana growers live in fear of a deadly fungus", "article": "No one can say for sure how it got there. The most intriguing theory is that it arrived on the muddy feet of magpie geese that flew all the way from the Northern Territory. Locals also wonder whether it came on the boots of backpackers who took the same route.   Related: Queensland banana farmers seek compensation for fungal disease    Regardless, it only takes a few grains of soil to spread Panama tropical race 4 (TR4), the fungus once branded the \u201cHIV of banana plantations\u201d. TR4 now has a staging point in north Queensland, where 95% of Australia\u2019s most popular food is grown. For the past 10 months, Australia\u2019s banana industry has been living with the effectively permanent risk it could be wiped out. But the impact of the outbreak has so far been largely shouldered by the farming family who reported a handful of sick plants at their Dingo Pocket Road farm in the picturesque Tully Valley in March last year. Bevan Robson, on the verge of retirement and a bumper crop after enduring wipeouts by two cyclones in the past 10 years, unwittingly sealed the likely end of a three-generation family venture by volunteering the bad news. This triggered a series of invasive biosecurity measures that have made future production \u2013 amid any lingering guilt over the further spread of TR4 \u2013 seem unviable. \u201cIt\u2019s been a bloody nightmare. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone,\u201d Robson tells Guardian Australia. The discovery of TR4 on the Cassowary Coast \u2013 that bountiful stretch of lush green valleys and rainforested ranges south of Cairns \u2013 cast a pall over a place that produces eight in every 10 bananas eaten in Australia.  Cassowary Coast shire council mayor, Bill Shannon, said the advent of the fungus, which has never been successfully contained anywhere else in the world, was \u201can ill wind that does nobody any good\u201d. The banana industry is one of the economic pillars of the region, supporting thousands of families \u2013 as well as drawing thousands of backpacker tourists who stop to earn money in plantation packing sheds. One local shed employs more than 300 South Korean backpackers at any one time, Shannon says. But the implications around a fruit that Shannon says is found \u201cliterally in every kid\u2019s lunchbox\u201d in Australia reach far beyond the Cassowary Coast. Something awry in these plantations \u2013 affecting the supply of the single biggest-selling item in Australian supermarkets \u2013 can produce a spike in the country\u2019s overall consumer price index. When Cyclone Larry in 2006 laid waste to countless rows of banana plants, prices quadrupled, shifting CPI 0.75% upwards and then down again when supply finally came back on board.     A farmer surveys his banana crop near Innisfail, Queensland, in the aftermath of Cyclone Larry in 2006. Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP    The doubling of banana prices after Cyclone Yasi in 2011 failed to make a dent in the overall CPI but singly pushed up the Australian Bureau of Statistics fruit price measure by almost 25%.  The appearance of TR4 has spurred a surge in growers investing for the first time in hundreds of kilometres of mesh fencing to isolate their plantations. The mesh is intended to keep out human trespassers like hunters and their dogs, and their quarry in wild pigs, who could all spread TR4 underfoot. But the fencing will also affect local native wildlife like the large flightless birds that give the region, thick with rainforest, its name.   Related: Banana variety risks wipeout from deadly fungus wilt    Shannon says the only consolation to emerge is that TR4 \u2013 after a suspected outbreak on a farm in Mareeba to the west was ruled out as a false positive \u2013 remains confined to a single plantation nine months on. \u201cThere was massive interest in [TR4] and extreme concern and there still is. But I suppose this is a best-case scenario that it\u2019s the one property,\u201d he says. Banana growers in Asia have largely been forced to look on helplessly as TR4, which first emerged in Taiwan in the 1980s, spread through Indonesia, Malaysia the Philippines, China and Pakistan. The pathogen, which attacks the roots of plants and effectively tricks them into starving themselves to death while leaving the fruit otherwise unblemished, cannot be eliminated from soil that contains it. Thus, the game in much of Asia has involved mixed attempts to find resistant strains of commercial banana crops, which consist almost uniformly the world over of the vulnerable Cavendish variety. Until its arrival at the Robsons\u2019 farm, Australia\u2019s banana growing heartland had been in splendid isolation from TR4 despite its advance into the Northern Territory about a decade ago. The NT has been the site for a government-funded trial of TR4-resistant plants through genetic modification by Queensland University of Technology scientists. But the same month TR4 emerged in the Tully Valley, the NT trial suffered a serious setback amid the outbreak of another disease, banana freckle.     Bananas are the single biggest-selling item in Australian supermarkets, and a widespread TR4 outbreak has the potential to produce a spike in the country\u2019s overall consumer price index. Photograph: Alan Porritt/AAP    The NT\u2019s eradication program for banana freckle dictated the destruction of some 18 varieties of TR4-resistant plants because they were in the \u201cred zone\u201d. Replanting of those trial plants is set to occur in the NT in May. Meanwhile, the Robson farm, which managed to harvest bananas last year after an eight-week shutdown and ongoing quarantine with biosecurity officials at its gate daily, technically has the green light to continue producing the fruit. But in a statement released by their lawyer last week, the family made clear their desire was to shut down the farm, giving the local industry its best chance of curtailing the spread of TR4. The statement noted that \u201cwhilst the Robsons\u2019 property is used for banana production, no matter how diligent they are with their quarantine measures, there is always the small possibility that the disease could be spread from the property through factors outside their control (for example in flood run-off or on the feet of birds)\u201d. The key hurdle is how one farming family can shut the farm without ruining themselves financially, with no compensation seemingly available from the Queensland government under laws governing biosecurity outbreaks that cannot be eliminated.  Hence, the banana industry, under the banner of the Australian Banana Growers Council (ABGC), is considering the unprecedented step of buying the farm just so it can lie undisturbed.      Around 95% of Australia\u2019s bananas are grown in north Queensland. Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP    It would be an act partly of solidarity with the Robsons, partly of self-preservation. ABGC chairman Doug Phillips said a buyout and closure would be the best step for both the industry and a family that \u201cdid the right thing by reporting the suspect banana plants [and] have endured financial and emotional hardship as a result\u201d. Shannon says growers around Tully have taken heart in the fact that no further farms have been infested.   Related: Cane toads on the march: invasive species finds 'ideal niche' in Australia    He says long-term containment of TR4 to a single farm would constitute an unprecedented victory in banana growing worldwide, against a disease that \u201conce in the soil is there forever\u201d. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve got a mature industry here, in the first world and with very good biosecurity practices, the argument goes if this disease is going to be beaten anywhere, it\u2019ll be at the Cassowary Coast,\u201d he says.  Shannon says the key difference compared with the NT outbreak was the speed of the initial detection by the Robsons and the quarantine response. He notes the irony that this swift and so far effective response comes from a region that once committed one of Australia\u2019s biggest biosecurity blunders in the cane toad. \u201cIt\u2019s true the cane toad was introduced into this country in the 1920s and it was a disaster. We have come a long way in terms of biosecurity,\u201d he says."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jan/12/literary-travel-10-must-read-books-for-travellers", "publicationDate": "2016-01-12T12:58:23Z", "tags": ["Literary trips", "Cultural trips", "Top 10s", "Travel", "Travel writing", "Books", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Having realised how anglocentric my reading was, I decided to try to read a novel, short story collection or memoir from every UN-recognised country, plus former UN member Taiwan (then 196 nations in all), in a calendar year."], "title": "Literary travel: around the world in 10 must-read books", "article": "In 2012, I embarked on an eccentric project.

I set up a blog, ayearofreadingtheworld.com, and asked the world\u2019s book lovers to help me. Pretty soon suggestions \u2013 and even books, manuscripts and unpublished translations \u2013 were flooding in from around the planet. My criteria for choosing the titles I read varied and developed throughout the year. Sometimes I opted for national favourites. At other times I picked wildcards that intrigued me because they seemed at odds with the society that had produced them, such as works by exiled writers. And there were narratives that challenged my preconceptions in a huge number of ways. Not all the books I read were set in the countries in question, but many were evocative of the regions they describe. Since then I\u2019ve continued to seek out books that transport me to a different place. Here are 10 of my favourites: Bhutan      The Circle of Karma by Kunzang Choden Following a young woman on her quest for enlightenment, this novel takes readers on a tour of the Buddhist gompas of the Himalayas in Bhutan and northern India, revealing marvels along the way. Seeing the religious sites through the eyes of a believer is a powerful experience, as are the descriptions of the majestic landscape and desperate living conditions the protagonist encounters. It is also the first book by a female Bhutanese author to be published outside Bhutan. Switzerland     Snow-covered mountains and autumnal forest reflected in the Lai Nair, Tarasp, Switzerland. Photograph: Alamy    Beauty on Earth by Charles-Ferdinand Ramuz,  translated from the French by Michelle Bailat-JonesThe early-20th-century Swiss writer Charles-Ferdinand Ramuz uses a visual artist\u2019s sensibility to capture life on the shores of a central European lake in this tale of a young Cuban immigrant\u2019s arrival in a rural community. Small details are rendered with fine brushwork: \u201ca ladder of sunshine \u2026 descended from a hole in the sky,\u201d a leaf \u201cwrinkled up \u2026 like a duck\u2019s foot\u201d. The result is a mesmeric picture, from which we can step back in the final pages to appreciate the full effect. Angola      Our Musseque by Jos\u00e9 Luandino Vieira, translated from the Portuguese by Robin Patterson  The shanty towns in Luanda, the capital of Angola, in the 1940s and 1950s, come are vividly depicted in this idiosyncratic novel published more than 40 years after the author wrote it, in prison. Prostitutes, shopkeepers, children and drunks jostle and collide, giving conflicting accounts of their experiences as the civil war approaches, a conflict that will change their lives for good. Funny, shocking and moving, it makes you nostalgic for a place you have never been. South Africa     The township of Soweto, Johannesburg. Photograph: Ben Curtis/AP    African Delights by Siphiwo MahalaRoving between South Africa\u2019s townships and the country\u2019s wealthier districts, this irreverent, bold and engrossing collection of interlinked stories captures the complexities, contradictions and tensions of the country in the late 20th century. The sharp contrasts in the settings highlight the injustices woven into the society, while the humour and winning audacity of many of the disadvantaged characters make the cruelty of the insults they have to live with all the more telling. At times you feel as though you are sitting at their kitchen tables listening to their stories. Myanmar      Smile as they Bow by Nu Nu Yi, translated from the Burmese by Alfred Birnbaum and Thi Thi Aye A spirit festival in a small Burmese village is the backdrop to this absorbing novel, one of the few books from Myanmar to have been translated into English. Nu Nu Yi\u2019s sensual descriptions of the hustle and bustle of the event \u2013 to which people from all walks of life flock to pay dancers to perform as a way of atoning for their misdeeds and drawing down blessings \u2013 are a joy to read. The colourful setting is second only to the vitality of the central character, Daisy Bond, a foul-mouthed transgender spirit dancer with a talent for deception. Pakistan      The Wandering Falcon by Jamil AhmadSome descriptions can be as breathtaking as the landscapes they depict, and Pakistani author Jamil Ahmad\u2019s certainly fits into that category. As the novel follows his nomadic protagonist, Tor Baz, the wild and treacherous hill country around the borders of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan unfolds in all its harsh beauty. Reading the book can feel like picking your way over its mountain crags, or standing on the plains watching pursuers approach through the clouds of dust whipped up by the region\u2019s 120-day winds. Grenada     St George\u2019s, the capital of Grenada. Photograph: Nik Wheeler/Alamy    The Ladies are Upstairs by Merle Collins Psychogeography has a significant role to play in this lively collection of short stories, in which colonial history haunts the landscape of present-day Grenada. Eerie encounters on lonely roads and the pomp of the architecture of centuries past combine to present a richer and more engrossing picture of the \u201cIsland of Spice\u201d than tourist brochures could ever do.

Equatorial Guinea      By Night the Mountain Burns by Juan Tom\u00e1s \u00c1vila Laurel, translated from the Spanish by Jethro SoutarThe tiny isle of Annob\u00f3n, a province of Equatorial Guinea, bursts from the page in this glorious novel. Packed with details about island life: from how you make a canoe out of a tree trunk and the practicalities of cutting dates off palm trees, to the songs and superstitions that bind the society together. The book bubbles with interest, while its narrative is based on the region\u2019s oral traditions. As a result it melds the familiar with the strange to draw us into the landscape and community of the island. This is only the second novel from Equatorial Guinea to be translated into English, so it is a rare and precious window on a little-known part of the globe. UK/Wales      Martha Jack and Shanco by Caryl Lewis, translated from the Welsh by Gwen DaviesThe west Wales landscape is a key player in this haunting novel about three ageing siblings who have spent their lives on their parents\u2019 farm. Lewis writes in such a way that the harsh cold and comfortlessness of the place seem to seep out of the pages to hold you in their grip, even as flashes of natural beauty burst from the text. It is a stark reminder that you don\u2019t have to travel far from home to find yourself in a different world. Peru     Perol lake in Peru\u2019s Cajamarca region. Photograph: Enrique Castro-Mendivil/Reuters    Death in the Andes by Mario Vargas Llosa, translated from the Spanish by Edith Grossman Peruvian Nobel prize-winner Mario Vargas Llosa\u2019s chilling tale is of murder, terrorism and vengeful spirits in the mountains. At once menacing and beautiful, his landscape is as unpredictable as the bands of outlaws that roam through it, plaguing the imagination of Corporal Lituma and his junior officer, who are charged with investigating disappearances in the mining community around their post.

Writing in Apple Daily [in a piece translated by Hong Kong Free Press], the US-based Chinese dissident writer Yu Jie said he had finished his critique of Xi\u2019s regime, Xi Jinping\u2019s Nightmare, in November 2015, and that his publisher, Open, had been due to start printing it on 1 January.

Jin wrote: \u201cthe difficulty of publishing political books in Hong Kong is already in the international spotlight [with] people in the industry \u2026 feeling great fear and pressure; they want to stay out of trouble so that they won\u2019t be the next one [to disappear].\u201d Five publishers and booksellers linked to Sage Communications, a firm known for publishing books criticising the Chinese government, have mysteriously gone missing in Hong Kong and Thailand in recent months, most recently UK citizen Lee Bo.

Do I say that because I am an extreme optimist? No, I say it because of my experience in debating the issue with grassroots members who have been turning out on cold, dark and sometimes wet winter evenings. There is a tone in the discussions that is a far distance from Labour in the 1980s. I should know - I was there. Then, the party did not simply disagree - there was loathing, contempt or hatred. Now, trying to convince members in Tottenham to support Trident is not a walk across an open field but the conversation was collegiate, or as they would say \u201ccomradely\u201d. Why is this?   Related: Renew Trident? It\u2019d make more sense to put Dad\u2019s Army on the case | Simon Jenkins    The first point to make is so obvious that it is rarely said \u2013 everyone in the Labour party wants to see a world free of nuclear weapons. The question is how best to do that \u2013 through unilateral or multilateral disarmament. A pragmatic choice, in effect, the focus being \u2013 to coin a phrase \u2013 that what matters is what works. Of course, there are those who for whom unilateralism is a principle. That is an honourable position, and one that has long history in the Labour party going back to deep roots in the dissenting tradition of Methodism. Pacificism has never been a majority position for Labour but nor, rightly, has it ever been absent. Commitment to disarmament leads to an ability across the membership to celebrate the success of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The estimate in the 1960s was that there would be 30-40 nuclear powers by today, and Mohamed ElBaradei, former director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency estimates that about that number have the capacity to be so today. But they do not choose to do so. There are only nine nuclear powers \u2013 the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus India, Pakistan, North Korea and likely Israel. More countries than that have given them up \u2013 Brazil, South Africa, Argentina, Taiwan, Libya, Sweden, Algeria, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus and now Iran. That success for a combination of treaties, international co-operation and muscular diplomacy is accepted as multilateralism working. And more, Tony Blair\u2019s achievement in building down the UK\u2019s own nuclear arsenal is acknowledged. Second, there is a consensus that the argument is not about either jobs or costs. Obviously, since the parliamentary vote is about building and maintaining the next generation of submarines, high-skilled, well paid engineering and manufacturing jobs are at stake. The unions representing those workers have a role to play in making that case and it is fair to say that there is no convincing evidence that any defence diversification could work to replace them. The point, though, is that the discussion of Trident is a serious one and the question is ultimately: is it right or wrong to have nuclear weapons? If it is right then the costs should be borne - though they are actually not onerous over the lifetime of the boats - and the jobs are a bonus. If it is wrong then it doesn\u2019t matter if Trident is cheap as chips \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t renew it, no matter how many jobs are created. So, the debate comes round and round to deterrence and the diabolical logic of mutually assured destruction. This is the third point. The destructive potential of nuclear weapons is almost inconceivable - which leads to almost everyone, including myself, being in equal parts terrified and appalled by their very existence. If this were a decision for the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom alone, I have no doubt that Labour would come to a quick and unanimous decision not to have them. But we live in a world in which others have them or have at times sought them.   Related: Labour should keep its powder dry on Trident \u2013 the debate has barely begun | Chris Parry    This question of a progressive party\u2019s vision of Britain in the world and, in particular, how we can be a force for good in that world, is one that rightly exercises Labour. By and large that is the exam question with which party members are wrestling \u2013 and doing so intelligently. That is not to say that there is always nuance and understanding on both sides. Debate does drive out subtlety at times \u2013 if only for the sake of rhetoric or emphasis. But there is a conversation \u2013 and it is one that respects the fundamental rule that conversation isn\u2019t simply waiting for your turn to speak. There is a lot of listening going on. What is the emblem of this? For me it is something with a link back to the bitter debates of the 80s. One of the members who spoke in Tottenham was Martha Osamor. She was famously vetoed by Neil Kinnock as a candidate for the Vauxhall byelection in 1989. She said one thing with which I wholeheartedly agree \u2013 Labour cannot be seen to be obsessed with defence at the expense of the domestic agenda that concerns most voters. The best way to ensure that is to have a comradely debate and not tear the party apart. So far, in my experience, so good."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/15/tsai-ing-wen-former-professor-on-course-to-be-most-powerful-woman-in-chinese-speaking-world",

Tsai, the 59-year-old candidate for the Democratic Progressive party (DPP), is widely tipped to win, bringing the curtain down on the eight-year rule of Nationalist (Kuomintang or KMT) party president, Ma Ying-jeou. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t win I would be beyond shocked,\u201d says Nathan Batto, a political scientist from Taipei\u2019s Academia Sinica.

Now the DPP is saying what we got was: 1, 4, 3.\u201d Tsai Ing-wen, the woman now hoping to change that, was born in 1956, seven years after Mao Zedong\u2019s communist troops took Beijing and forced Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s nationalists to flee across the Taiwan Strait. One of nine children, she was initially raised in Fenggang, a village in the southern county of Pingtung, but later moved to the capital where she spent her teens growing up in downtown Taipei. In an interview with Time magazine in 2015, Tsai recalled how, as the youngest daughter, she was required to spend her idle hours caring for her entrepreneur father. \u201cI was not considered a kid that would be successful in my career,\u201d she said. Tsai quickly set about confounding those expectations. She earned a law degree from Taipei\u2019s National Taiwan University and headed east to Cornell University in New York for a masters. The Big Apple seemed like a good place for a young woman yearning for \u201ca revolutionary life\u201d, she told Time. After Cornell, Tsai made for London, enrolling at the LSE where she gained a PhD in law. That spell in London left her with not only a \u201cquirky little British accent\u201d but also an international perspective that many of her predecessors in the DPP leadership lacked, says Cole. \u201cShe is certainly a lot more worldly than previous leaders of the party.\u201d Gerrit van der Wees, a Taiwan expert who has spent time with Tsai during her frequent trips to the United States, says she likes to compare herself to Angela Merkel, \u201c[who is] also a very decisive person, a person who has an open government, who is in favour of an open society.\u201d \u201cThe fact that Angela Merkel opened the borders to the Syrian refugees was something that Tsai commented on as being a very courageous and positive step that she would take too,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there are many good [similarities] there.\u201d After leaving London in 1984, Tsai returned to Taiwan to take up a series of teaching positions at universities in the city where she was raised. By the early 90s she had gone into government, working as a key trade negotiator involved in Taiwan\u2019s in entry into the World Trade Organisation, and then as a national security adviser to the KMT president Lee Teng-hui. When DPP leader Chen Shui-bian took over from Lee, in 2000, Tsai was given the thorny task of leading the Mainland Affairs Council, which handles relations with China. A leaked US diplomatic cable, written in 2006, shows Tsai the technocrat built a reputation as \u201ca tenacious negotiator\u201d and \u201ca savvy insider\u201d with \u201cimpressive economic experience\u201d. \u201cTsai is viewed as extremely capable and very persuasive,\u201d it said. A second diplomatic dispatch, penned in 2008 by Stephen M Young, now the United States\u2019 consul general in Hong Kong, foresaw the political rise of the \u201cthoughtful\u201d Taiwanese politician. \u201cTsai\u2019s moderate and soft spoken personality, as well as her academic and professional qualifications, will appeal to those in the centre of Taiwan\u2019s political spectrum in a way that more strident DPP politicians do not,\u201d Young wrote. \u201cHer low-key personality may also disarm her competitors, who would do well not to underestimate [her].\u201d Despite now standing on the cusp of becoming one of the world\u2019s most powerful women, Tsai was a latecomer to political life, only joining the DPP in 2004. \u201cShe is more thoughtful scholar than slogan-shouting politico,\u201d noted a 2012 profile.  But allies say her impact on the party was profound. Supporters credit her with transforming the DPP after its bruising election defeat in 2008, when Ma Ying-jeou\u2019s victory ushered in eight years in which Taiwan swung dramatically towards Beijing. \u201cA lot of people here were of the opinion that it was over for the DPP [in 2008],\u201d recalls Cole. \u201cThey were financially broke, [outgoing] president Chen [Shui-bian] was facing allegations of corruption and they had gotten trounced in the elections by Ma Ying-jeou and the KMT.\u201d \u201cShe arrived at the right time and very quickly was able to rehabilitate the DPP and make it once again a viable party within a matter of two or three years.\u201d Tsai\u2019s first bid for a top political job came in 2010 when she narrowly missed out on becoming mayor of New Taipei City. Two years later, in 2012, she ran for president, but again lost out, conceding defeat by telling supporters: \u201cTo all the dear people of Taiwan: one day we will come back and we will not give up.\u201d Cole, who has worked for Tsai\u2019s Thinking Taiwan Foundation since 2014, says his employer considered throwing in the towel after that defeat. \u201cI know that it took her quite a while, in 2012, to decide whether she would go back to politics or just stay with the Foundation and continue to organise academic conferences and all that.\u201d But Cole says he saw in his employer \u201ca sense of calling, a sense of responsibility, a sense that things were probably not going in the right direction both within the DPP and within Taiwan and that she would have the ability to play a role in turning things around.\u201d With Tsai boasting a double-digital lead in opinion polls, that bid to turn things around is likely to begin on Saturday.  She has vowed to boost the island\u2019s struggling economy by diversifying trade relations and pledged to tackle youth unemployment and a growing wealth gap. The introverted scholar will also seek to reshape relations with Beijing although she has promised to uphold the uneasy status quo between democratic Taiwan and one-party China.  \u201cShe has a very strong sense of Taiwan\u2019s rightful place, as she sees it, in the international community, and that rightful place is now being undermined by what Ma Ying-jeou has been trying to do over the past few years, pushing Taiwan closer to China,\u201d says van der Wees. \u201cSo she wants to push that more in the right direction.\u201d That, coupled with the possibility of the traditionally pro-independence DPP winning control over Taiwan\u2019s legislature, has China\u2019s Communist leaders on edge.  \u201cFor all Tsai\u2019s moderation \u2013 which Beijing hears, but doesn\u2019t buy \u2013 there is deep suspicion about her intentions,\u201d said Jon Sullivan, a Taiwan expert from the University of Nottingham.

Nathan Batto, a Taipei-based political scientist, said there was excitement in Taiwan \u2013 which China still considers part of its territory but has been ruled independently since 1949 \u2013 at the prospect of electing its first female commander-in-chief. \u201cIt is a source of quite a bit of pride, I think, that she will be the first female president and \u2013 unlike president Park [Geun-hye] in Korea or prime minister [Indira] Gandhi in India or Yingluck [Shinawatra] in Thailand \u2013 Tsai Ing-wen is not a family politician,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has done this on her own. It is not like there is a power behind the throne.\u201d  Experts say Tsai\u2019s expected triumph is largely the result of disillusionment with the KMT\u2019s stewardship of the economy, which grew just 1% last year despite Ma\u2019s promises that Taiwan\u2019s ever closer ties to Beijing would prove an economic boon.  \u201cThe rich have become very rich and the middle class has really not benefited,\u201d said Gerrit van der Wees, the editor of the Taiwan Communiqu\u00e9 political journal.  With China\u2019s economy now slowing \u201cclose ties with China purely on economic terms is not flying very much as an argument these days\u201d, he added.  Cole said Tsai\u2019s double-digit lead in the polls was also a reflection of how the KMT had lost touch with younger voters who now saw its leaders as distant and outdated. \u201cThe KMT has lost its footing. It has been really bizarre in recent weeks and months. You listen to what they are saying on TV, you watch their commercials and we are all scratching our heads [thinking]: \u2018Who are you talking to?\u2019 \u201cOften people comment that their message would have seemed current 30 years ago,\u201d Cole added. \u201cThey seem to have missed the boat on the generational change that we have seen in Taiwan on anything from LGBT rights to empowering civil society, NGOS [and] being more worldly rather than focusing solely on China.\u201d Tsai \u2013 who supporters know as \u2018Little Ing\u2019 \u2013 has sought to capitalise on the KMT\u2019s image as a relic of the past. \u201cGive rational politics a chance! Give Tsai Ing-wen a chance! Let\u2019s create a new politics in Taiwan!\u201d the former law professor told crowds at one of her final campaign rallies this week. Van der Wees said young voters were concerned that the outgoing president had been \u201ctoo chummy with a still very repressive and undemocratic China\u201d and had taken Taiwan \u201ctoo fast, too far in China\u2019s direction.\u201d \u201cThey want to have a more positive relationship with China... but they don\u2019t want to be controlled in any way by China and they don\u2019t want their future to be controlled by China,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a pretty fundamental point that people are making [and] this is the direction for I think a pretty significant time to come because it has been prompted by the younger generation.\u201d The victory of independence-leaning Tsai will not please Chinese president Xi Jinping who took part in a historic summit with Taiwan\u2019s departing president last November, telling him: \u201cNothing can separate us.\u201d  \u201c[Under Tsai] communication between mainland China and Taiwan won\u2019t be as good as it is now,\u201d said Li Jiaquan, a professor at Beijing\u2019s Institute of Taiwan Studies.  Li described Tsai as a \u201cflexible\u201d independence supporter rather than a \u201cradical\u201d one. \u201cBut the flexible Taiwan independence movement is still the Taiwan independence movement, which can be even more deceptive and dangerous,\u201d he added.  The KMT has tried to derail Tsai\u2019s chances on Saturday by stoking voters\u2019 fears of conflict with China. \u201cIf [you] don\u2019t vote for the Nationalists, the future is really uncertain,\u201d Ma Ying-jeou said this week, according to Reuters. \u201cOur policy is aiming for peace and stability. We can ensure everyone that there won\u2019t be a war across the Strait.\u201d But experts say that while Tsai, a former law professor and technocrat, will seek to halt or even reverse Taiwan\u2019s drift towards China, she is unlikely to make any dramatic moves such asserting the island\u2019s independence. \u201cShe is not going to rock the boat,\u201d said van der Wees. \u201cShe is going to move things forwards in a positive fashion.\u201d Batto, who runs the Frozen Garlic blog about Taiwanese politics said Tsai had shown extreme caution when talking about cross-straits relations and China during her campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve gone out and listened to her many, many times on the stump when you would expect there to be a little bit less caution. But every speech she makes you hear the wordings are very careful,\u201d he said.  \u201cShe is very conscious of every word \u2013 especially when she is talking about China. I think she has been very careful to think how this is going to affect her in government when she makes her statements. She is very wary of creating a toxic relationship [with China], she is very wary of burning bridges she doesn\u2019t necessarily want to burn.\u201d Speaking on the eve of Saturday\u2019s vote, Tsai again insisted she would keep communication channels open with Beijing.  \u201cI know that stability across the Taiwan Strait is in our shared interests. I would do my best to maintain that stability,\u201d she said.

Photograph: Damir Sagolj/Reuters    Tsai narrowly lost out on the presidency four years ago. The London School of Economics postgraduate had considered a return to academia before deciding to launch a second attempt at Taiwan\u2019s highest office. Analysts have said growing public dissatisfaction with the outgoing KMT president, Ma Ying-jeou, and an economy that weakened dramatically last year, helped propel Tsai to victory. Her success ends eight years of KMT rule, during which there has been an unprecedented thaw in relations between the self-ruled island and China. Ma, who gained the presidency in 2008, had faced increasing criticism for what critics described as his opaque style of governance and the widespread perception that his pro-China policies had failed to deliver significant economic gains. His detente with Beijing culminated in a historic cross-strait summit with Xi Jinping last November but critics said the blossoming trade and tourism ties had done little to improve ordinary people\u2019s lives. \u201cOver the past four years, I\u2019ve travelled around Taiwan, I\u2019ve seen the suffering of the people and I\u2019ve heard the public\u2019s call for change,\u201d Tsai told her final campaign rally on Friday. \u201cDemocratic politics is responsible politics, if [a government] cannot do it well, then we change it.\u201d   Related: Taiwan elections: the British educated scholar soon to be the most powerful woman in the Chinese-speaking world    Tsai\u2019s victory will alarm China\u2019s Communist party leaders, who still view Taiwan as part of their country\u2019s territory and hope one day to reabsorb the island, which has ruled itself since 1949. Beijing\u2019s army of internet censors blocked her name on Saturday night as the scale of the DPP victory became apparent. \u201c[The election result] could exert a profound influence on the region,\u201d the party-run Global Times tabloid warned this week in an editorial. \u201cIt adds uncertainties to Taiwan\u2019s mainland policy as well as the situation across the straits.\u201d Tsai largely avoided commenting on bilateral relations during campaigning but her party has traditionally supported formal independence from China, rather than the current de facto independence. Beijing has vowed to use military force against attempts at formal independence and keeps more than 1,000 ballistic missiles facing across the Taiwan Strait. However, experts say they do not expect dramatic changes in Taiwan\u2019s stance on China when Tsai takes power in May. \u201cI really don\u2019t think that [bilateral relations] are going to be the first item on her agenda. I think her main focus, especially in the first few years, is going to be more on domestic issues, talking more about doing social welfare programmes, maybe revising the tax code, probably doing some kind of big judicial reform, attacking the food safety system,\u201d said Nathan Batto, a political scientist from Taipei\u2019s Academia Sinica. \u201cAs far as cross-strait [ties] goes, I really think that she is interested in the status quo. Let\u2019s continue to have talks in which we disagree about what the country is, or, for that matter, whether there is one country. But whatever contracts have already been signed, that is fine. Tourists should continue to come, investment should continue to go there, jobs and Taiwanese companies in China should continue to be able to operate as Taiwanese companies. \u201cIf all that stuff changes it will be because China decides to change it. And I think she is putting the onus on China,\u201d Batto said. J Michael Cole, a senior fellow at the University of Nottingham\u2019s China Policy Institute, said: \u201cThe variable here will be how Beijing reacts to a DPP victory. My sense is that by now the Chinese government should know enough about Taiwan to know that the last thing it wants to do is to punish the Taiwanese for their voting choices. \u201cChina\u2019s ability to punish Taiwan is actually surprisingly limited because pretty much anything that it does to alienate the Taiwanese would be counterproductive. The last thing that China wants right now is to propel Taiwan in a different direction. So how do you keep it as close as possible? By continuing to engage it.\u201d Speaking on Saturday night after her victory, Tsai vowed to \u201cgreatly contribute towards peace and stability in the region\u201d. She said: \u201cDuring this election I have promised on many occasions that I will build a consistent, predictable and sustainable cross-strait relationship. Following the will and consensus of the Taiwanese people, we will work towards maintaining the status quo for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait in order to bring the greatest benefits and wellbeing to the Taiwanese people.\u201d She added: \u201cI will march forwards, together with the 23 million people of Taiwan. Together we will overcome the challenges that this country faces. We will not be divided by an election. Instead we will become even more united because of our democracy.\u201d "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/18/hou-hsiao-hsein-the-assassin", "publicationDate": "2016-01-18T09:00:02Z", "tags": ["The Assassin", "Film", "Culture"], "sentences": ["First, a shame-faced confession: until this weekend, I had never seen a movie by the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien."], "title": "Hou Hsaio-hsien: the director stripping cinema to its essence", "article": "First, a shame-faced confession: until this weekend, I had never seen a movie by the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien.

Related: The Assassin review - enigmatically refined martial arts tale baffles beautifully    It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t know who he is. I\u2019ve badly wanted to see his work since I first heard about his \u201ccoming of age\u201d trilogy in the mid-1980s, but for a long period his movies were very hard to see in cinemas or on video. Then, about 10 years ago, his work began to be released in the US, but only his newer movies, those made in Japan or Paris, or his contributions to anthology movies. And meeting him in an anthology movie would be like first encountering Alain Resnais or Agn\u00e8s Varda by watching Far From Vietnam, misleading at best. So I held off seeing those. The movies I most wanted to see, those made in his native country, were still hard to find, so I waited and waited. Now that I\u2019ve seen The Assassin, I plan to chase down his early work, no matter the expense, and region-coding be damned.            Hou and I are both nuts about Ozu, so it was always obvious we\u2019d get along. The Assassin is a good deal busier than most Ozu, but bears many of the master\u2019s hallmarks: stately pacing; a camera that moves little but misses nothing; exquisite framing (and, in moving shots, exquisite reframing); and meticulously beautiful composition and mise-en-sc\u00e8ne (steam, smoke, mist are all beloved by Hou).  The languorous pace allows the ravenous eye to absorb all the carefully posed elements in each frame: the interiors subdivided into multiple planes of focus; the human figures moving as if choreographed; while in his landscapes, mountain ridges recede away in waves, and a single swan glides from left to right through a glassy lake at twilight, its wake like a knife wound in blue-black silk. Throughout, we see and hear the wind in the trees, the very image that DW Griffith considered the essence of cinema.   Related: The Assassin director: why I gave plot the chop    No matter how prodigiously beautiful it may be, The Assassin is cinema stripped down to its essence: sound + image. The bonus is that it\u2019s Hou\u2019s first foray into wuxia martial arts action; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon territory. Calm shots are drawn out like long, linear notes on a stringed instrument, a violin or cello, until the brief bursts of action arrive like violent percussion, a fist punching through the screen at us, reminding me of those moments of violence in Kubrick when the locked-down camera suddenly goes handheld. What story there is \u2013 a trained female assassin\u2019s loyalties are torn \u2013 is like the fables that underpin certain Malick movies: just enough to hang a rapturous movie experience on; not enough to get in the way. The results are magical and sublime, and I now have, in Hou Hsiao-hsien, a new best friend at the movies.

Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d, a major policy shift first outlined in 2011, is mired in confusion against a backdrop of a \u201csignificantly more complicated\u201d international security picture, the researchers argue. The study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a leading Washington thinktank, calls for America to flex its military muscle in the region by deploying extra nuclear attack submarines and developing advanced long-range missiles. The report was commissioned by the Department of Defense at the behest of Congress and is set to be discussed at a hearing of the Senate armed services committee. It is likely to be seized on by Republican presidential candidates who accuse Obama of weak leadership in the face of a rising China, resurgent Russia and nuclear-armed North Korea. \u201cChinese and North Korean actions are routinely challenging the credibility of US security commitments, and at the current rate of US capability development, the balance of military power in the region is shifting against the United States,\u201d the report states. \u201cRobust funding is needed to implement the rebalance.\u201d Obama had hoped his foreign policy shift towards Asia would renew alliances, capitalise on economic opportunities and allow him to escape the gravitational pull of the strife-torn Middle East. But it has proved to be a difficult balancing act, for example when frostiness between China and Japan makes it clear that Washington remains on the latter\u2019s side. Former defense secretary Chuck Hagel, a champion of the strategy, resigned just over a year ago. The CSIS\u2019s follow-up to a 2012 study says the US should continue its three historically interrelated interests in Asia and the Pacific: protecting America and its allies; promoting trade; and supporting democracy. Then it outlines four areas to build upon. First, it argues, Washington needs to continue aligning Asia strategy within the US government and with allies and partners. \u201cThe study finds that although the Obama administration has issued a series of speeches and documents on the rebalance, there remains no central statement of the US government\u2019s rebalance strategy.\u201d During interviews with leaders throughout the Department of Defense, in other US departments and agencies, on Capitol Hill and across the Asia-Pacific, the study team \u201cconsistently heard confusion about the rebalance strategy and concern about its implementation\u201d. Second, the authors say, US leaders should accelerate efforts to strengthen ally and partner capability, capacity, resilience and interoperability.

I just work with what I have.\u201d And what Sharapova has is a few more drop shots in her locker, not all of them a success. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I have added to my game, and that\u2019s helped me, especially playing against opponents that stay far back,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m aggressive and I have depth on my shots, it\u2019s just good to have that variety to bring them in, to move forward myself.

Discarded marine snail shells deeply buried in the muck of human habitation represent the first evidence of seafood dinners. From then on, the increasing presence and richness of archaeological remains, and historical evidence, testify to our deepening love affair with seafood.   Related: Fish stocks: Good news is a drop in the ocean | Editorial    We soon developed the wits, skill and technological armoury necessary to capture fish and shellfish. Cave trash in East Timor shows that we could catch sharks and tuna over 40,000 years ago. North African mosaics depict us 2,000 years ago catching fish from boats with cast nets, drift nets, hook and line and even amphora-shaped octopus traps. But it wasn\u2019t until the late 19th century, when steam engines were added to boats, that the era of industrial fishing began. Thereafter, fishing intensified swiftly and spread across the world\u2019s seas and oceans, going further offshore and reaching deeper. In the aftermath of the second world war there was great optimism that the oceans would feed humanity forever. Books were published with titles such as The Inexhaustible Sea, and the newly constituted Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations \u2013 FAO for short \u2013 began to collect statistics on how many fish we landed. Every year from 1950, their figures logged the growing might of the world\u2019s fishing fleets in the relentless growth of the heap of fish and shellfish taken from the sea. Problems began to emerge with fishing in the 1960s and 70s as the productivity of many stocks faltered and some fisheries collapsed, as did that for North Sea herring. The toll of fishing rose into the 1990s with more stock collapses, with Canadian cod the biggest crash. But optimists could take heart at least from the FAO data: although catches had levelled off, they were not falling. With hindsight, and the benefit of a study published this week by Daniel Pauly and Dirk Zeller of Canada\u2019s University of British Columbia, we now see that we placed too much faith in FAO.   Related: Overfishing is a solvable environmental challenge for the EU | Aniol Esteban    The study shows in stark detail that FAO figures do not report lots of the fish we catch: fish taken by small-scale and subsistence fishers, especially in developing countries, recreational catches, and catches thrown away at sea because they either have low value or boats have no quota for them. In reality, we take 50% more fish than we thought \u2013 a staggering total of about 130m tonnes a year all told. That levelling off in landings was an illusion too. \u201cPeak fish\u201d came in 1996, since when landings have declined by over 1m tonnes every year (despite our holding on to more of the fish we once threw over the side). Statistics are only as good as the data on which they are based, but these figures represent a huge improvement on FAO numbers. They are calculated from hundreds of country-by-country analyses that painstakingly reconstructed landings year by year back to 1950. We can be confident in the picture they paint. At the global scale, fisheries are in trouble. And while some countries are working hard to make their industries sustainable, such as the US and New Zealand, most are in deepening crisis. Seafood is immensely important. An estimated 1 billion people depend on it as their main source of animal protein, and demand will only rise as the world population soars. But just when we need it most, the reliability of seafood is in doubt. It is particularly worrying that industrial fleets from places such as the EU, China, Taiwan and Japan, having depleted their own stocks, are now overfishing the waters of developing countries to which they have bought access. Their plunder \u2013 the take is large and reckless enough to justify the word \u2013 jeopardises the livelihoods of countless people. In west Africa, falling fish availability in markets has led to increased hunting of bushmeat, bringing people into greater contact with diseases carried by wildlife, perhaps even Ebola. We can\u2019t go on this way for much longer. Recognising you have a problem is the first step on the road to recovery, and these new figures leave us in no doubt of the urgency of fixing overfishing. In a nutshell, we have to fish less, waste less and devise ways to capture what we want more selectively and with less collateral damage. We must also protect more by putting places off limits to fishing so that the seas can continue to thrive and provide in our fast-changing world."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/21/barclays-axe-1200-investment-bank-jobs-worldwide", "publicationDate": "2016-01-21T16:48:48Z", "tags": ["Barclays", "Banking", "Business", "Job losses"], "sentences": ["The bank will pull out of Australia, Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, but will offer banking coverage for those countries from other locations."], "title": "Barclays to axe 1,200 investment bank jobs worldwide", "article": "The new Barclays boss, Jes Staley, has kicked off a fresh wave of cuts at the group\u2019s investment banking arm, with plans to axe 1,200 jobs and pull out of several Asian countries.

Her Democratic Progressive party (DPP) is, in the careful euphemism usually employed, \u201cindependence leaning\u201d, but no qualification of the word \u201cindependence\u201d is, in the case of Taiwan, satisfactory to the People\u2019s Republic of China. The Facebook messages are supposedly from concerned individual citizens, and the pictures of naval manoeuvres just another piece of news. But in truth they are a piece of calculated, although deniable, rudeness by Beijing. The cool-headed Ms Tsai will not take them too seriously, but they do not bode particularly well for the future. Today\u2019s China is not only economically over-extended, as its stock markets have been demonstrating in recent days. It is also politically over-extended, with its island-building in the South China Sea further alienating its neighbours, its heavy hand in supposedly autonomous Hong Kong increasingly apparent, and its attempts to advance the objective of \u201cone China\u201d in disarray after the party it favours in Taiwan, the Kuomintang (KMT), was roundly defeated in both presidential and parliamentary elections earlier this month. Chinese president Xi Jinping came to power in 2012 with the ambition of solving the Taiwan \u201cproblem\u201d \u2013 by eventually incorporating the island into China \u2013 during his time in office. But although he and the previous Taiwanese president, Ma Ying-jeou, greatly expanded the economic relationship, the results were not what either had expected. Most Taiwanese were not grateful, felt any benefits had gone to corporations rather than to ordinary people, and were anxious about the political implications of the new economic links, as the Sunflower Movement\u2019s occupation of the legislature in spring 2014 showed. If the meeting between Ma and Xi in late 2015 in Singapore, historic in the sense that it was the first between communist and nationalist leaders since 1949, was intended to reverse the KMT\u2019s faltering fortunes, it did not do so. It may even have accelerated the KMT\u2019s decline. Taiwanese did not of course vote for independence earlier this month. They know that would be a provocation Beijing could not bear. Polls have for years consistently shown that a majority want to preserve the status quo into the foreseeable future \u2013 a separate life, but not a formal separation. The long-term concern of the voters, this time, was to see that sense of separateness restated politically. Their more immediate concern was with an economy doing less well than in the past, too dependent on one market, namely China, and providing fewer jobs, especially the quality jobs that its increasingly well educated young people need. They voted for the party they felt could best provide an answer on both counts. Ms Tsai will have a hard time meeting such expectations. Beijing could sabotage a DPP government by bribing and bullying the few nations that still recognise Taipei into ending diplomatic relations, keeping Taiwan out of multilateral organisations and trade pacts, and cutting down the number of Chinese tourists visiting the island, an important source of income. Even if China refrains from such moves, the Taiwanese economy has serious structural problems, which will not easily be solved. The big problem on both sides of the Strait is language. It is a minefield that could blow up in both Beijing\u2019s and Tapei\u2019s faces. Beijing insists on a vocabulary that prejudges the issue, from which Taipei backs away. The wrong words could lead to irrational actions that neither side really wants. President-elect Tsai has to decide on a form of words on \u201cone China\u201d that will not affront Beijing too much but will not open her to a charge of selling out at home by her supporters. On the South China Sea, if she were even to hint at a change in the Taiwanese position on the islands, which has been essentially the same as that of the People\u2019s Republic and indeed predates it, that would be a red rag for China. China\u2019s real difficulty, when it encounters reverses, is that it has no reverse gear. The best hope for the next few years is that President Tsai is a resilient politician who rescued her party from a very weak position, has it firmly under control, and is both cautious and shrewd. She is a steady pair of hands. Beijing ought be content with that."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/29/happy-hour-and-drinks-are-still-flowing-in-the-gambia-the-newest-islamic-state", "publicationDate": "2016-01-29T09:00:01Z", "tags": ["The Gambia", "Africa", "World news", "Global development", "Human rights", "Islam", "Religion"], "sentences": ["As well as EU grants, generous funding from Libya has dried up since the revolution and Jammeh also cut ties with Taiwan in 2013 after it refused to provide additional cash bailouts."], "title": "Happy hour and drinks are still flowing in the Gambia, the newest Islamic state", "article": "It may be the world\u2019s newest Islamic state, but on the Gambia\u2019s beaches it was business as usual. Dreadlocked, muscular young men offered their company to middle-aged female tourists, the sweet scent of marijuana hung on the ocean breeze, bars advertised happy hour cocktails, and bared breasts turned pink in near-equatorial sunshine. Few of those escaping the cold and damp of a northern European winter appeared to be aware of President Yahya Jammeh\u2019s surprise proclamation last month that the tiny African country he has ruled with an iron grip for more than 20 years would henceforth be known as the Islamic Republic of the Gambia.  \u201cReally?\u201d said Linda, 49, with a hoot of disbelieving laughter. Turning to her holiday companion outside Solomon\u2019s beach cafe, she added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem at all Islamic, does it, Chrissie? Quick, we\u2019d better get another beer in before they close all the bars.\u201d   The Gambia map   Such a step seems unlikely in a country that depends heavily on tourism. Since Jammeh\u2019s announcement of the new name \u2013 in line with the Gambia\u2019s \u201creligious identity and values\u201d, he said, and to symbolise a break with its \u201ccolonial legacy\u201d \u2013 there have been few discernible changes in mainland Africa\u2019s smallest country. An order that all female government employees must cover their heads was rescinded 10 days later because it had made women \u201cunhappy\u201d, according to a government statement. Jammeh has assured the Gambia\u2019s small Christian population, about 4% of the 1.8 million total, that there will be no restrictions on religions other than Islam. And although the president reportedly wanted to implement sharia law more than a decade ago, as yet there have been no concrete moves to do so.   Related: The Gambia now an Islamic republic, says President Yahya Jammeh    But foreign diplomats have been instructed to refer to the Islamic Republic of the Gambia in all official communications, and the country\u2019s only television channel \u2013 run by the state \u2013 routinely uses the new name in its broadcasts. The scholarly Supreme Islamic Council has been dispatched to tour the Gambia\u2019s towns and villages to shore up support for the Islamic state. Analysts, diplomats and exiled dissidents believe the name change signifies a realignment of the former British colony with the Arab world, in particular the wealthy Gulf states. Some say the move could jeopardise the resumption of European funding, halted in December 2014 amid criticism of human rights abuses. It could also damage the tourist industry and possibly encourage the radicalisation of youth in a country characterised by one observer as \u201csoft Islam\u201d. Jammeh seized power in a 1994 coup, almost 30 years after the country secured independence from Britain. Since then, he has won five-yearly presidential elections with increasing majorities that have been matched by sliding credibility. Any serious opposition is quickly stamped on; diplomats speak of polling irregularities and bought votes. With no limit on the number of terms he may serve, he is expected to win another resounding victory in the election scheduled for December. Some say the 50-year-old intends to stay on as president for another two decades.     President Yayah Jammeh during the swearing-in ceremony for his fourth term, in 2012. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    Jammeh is described as intelligent and charming, even charismatic, but unpredictable. Many pronouncements appear to be made on a whim. In 2007, he announced he had found a herbal cure for Aids; this month he pledged to \u201cconquer cancer\u201d by the end of the year. He also said he would ban FGM after the Guardian launched a global campaign. Analysts say that even those who follow him closely have real challenges in interpreting his actions.

But no one is giving him frank advice,\u201d said a diplomat based in the region. \u201cHe burns bridges faster than he builds them,\u201d said another long-time observer. Jammeh\u2019s closest ally and role model was Muammar Gaddafi, the former despotic leader of Libya who was overthrown and died in 2011, and with whom \u2013 it is rumoured \u2013 he shared a taste for young women. Over the past two decades, Jammeh has tightened his hold on power with the help of the feared National Intelligence Agency and an unofficial paramilitary force, known as the Jungulers, which routinely detains, tortures and disappears those perceived as a threat to the regime. A Human Rights Watch report, State of Fear, published in September, detailed \u201crampant human rights abuses\u201d and a \u201cpervasive climate of fear\u201d in the Gambia. Jammeh, it said, had created \u201cone of the most repressive and authoritarian administrations on the continent\u201d. It said the Jungulers \u201ctypically wear all-black clothing, cover their faces and are armed with machetes and firearms, including Kalashnikov assault rifles. They have been implicated in numerous incidents of torture and extrajudicial executions.\u201d Alongside the weakening of opposition political parties, there is little freedom of expression. In a population with a high proportion of illiteracy, many depend for information on the state-run television channel. Independent journalists are regularly detained, disappeared or forced to flee, and no international media organisations are based in the country.

We are ready to kill saboteurs,\u201d Jammeh said in 2009. LGBT people have long been particular targets of Jammeh\u2019s regime. Last May, the president said he would \u201cslit the throats\u201d of any gay men in the Gambia, adding: \u201cNo one will ever set eyes on you again, and no white person can do anything about it.\u201d Previously he had described gays and lesbians as \u201cvermin\u201d, an \u201cevil and strange social cancer\u201d, and \u201canti-God, anti-human and anti-civilisation\u201d. In October 2014, the government introduced a new crime of \u201caggravated homosexuality\u201d with a penalty of life imprisonment.   Related: The Gambia bans female genital mutilation    Last May, Jammeh rejected a series of recommendations from the UN Human Rights Council, including decriminalising homosexuality, removing restrictions on freedom of expression and abolishing the death penalty. Not surprisingly, many Gambians have fled the country. According to Eurostat, the number seeking asylum in EU member states tripled between 2013 and 2014, to 11,500. Others leave to improve their economic opportunities and send money home to impoverished families. Thirteen months ago, Jammeh cut ties with the EU after it had raised concerns over human rights abuses. In turn, the EU blocked $16m of development funding \u2013 a critical sum for the impoverished country, whose fragile economy relies on tourism, remittances and peanut exports. Income from tourism, which accounts for at least 20% of GDP, plummeted as a result of the recent Ebola crisis in west Africa, even though there was not a single case in the Gambia, and it has yet to recover.   Related: The Gambia faces battle to deter its young people from migrating abroad | Louise Hunt    The row with the EU, along with an earlier sudden decision to pull out of the Commonwealth on the grounds it was a \u201cneocolonial institution\u201d, is seen as a significant factor in the president\u2019s declaration of an Islamic state. \u201cHe\u2019s done this now because he\u2019s starved of funds,\u201d said Sidi Sanneh, a former Gambian diplomat now living in exile in the US. As well as EU grants, generous funding from Libya has dried up since the revolution and Jammeh also cut ties with Taiwan in 2013 after it refused to provide additional cash bailouts. \u201cJammeh is looking to the Gulf states \u2013 Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait \u2013 for the funds he\u2019s being denied by traditional donors, especially the EU,\u201d said Sanneh. According to Marloes Janson, of the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, \u201cJammeh has lost western support, so he\u2019s now turning to the Muslim world\u201d. But, she adds, the prevalence of sex tourism in the Gambia may also have fuelled the president\u2019s Islamism. In a bid to counter \u201cnational decay\u201d, government clean-up campaigns have targeted \u201cbumsters\u201d \u2013 the young men who sell sexual services to female tourists \u2013 rounding them up, shaving their heads and sending them for periods of forced labour. \u201c[Jammeh] has not only used religion to shore up his legitimacy as a Muslim leader, but also to redefine the Gambian nation through his policing of morality,\u201d said Janson.

The country is peaceful in a region where Islamic extremism has taken hold in some places. There are mosques in every neighbourhood, but Gambians are observant rather than devout Muslims, and fundamentalism is rare. Although Jammeh banned gambling last year, alcohol is freely available. But grinding poverty and lack of opportunity could combine with increasing repression and religiosity into a potent cocktail. \u201cJammeh is making a mistake. He\u2019s making things worse by stirring up religious sentiment,\u201d said Sanneh. \u201cIt\u2019s an inopportune moment to insert the word \u2018Islamic\u2019 into the name of the country when you have Isis [Islamic State] running all over the region.\u201d Another Gambian dissident, Imam Baba Leigh, who fled to the US in 2013 after being imprisoned for five months, warned of radicalisation. \u201cIsis, al-Qaida, Boko Haram \u2013 they are like wildfire. If they can penetrate the UK, the US, Nigeria, Libya, I see no reason why they can\u2019t penetrate the Gambia too, especially when its leader calls a secular country an Islamic state.\u201d     A vendor working on a beach in Gambia. Photograph: Alamy    Jammeh, who has survived four coup attempts \u2013 the last a little more than a year ago \u2013 appears determined to entrench his power. \u201cHe\u2019s very unpopular, but he rules by fear,\u201d said Sanneh. A diplomat in the region said Jammeh \u201chas his jackboot at the public\u2019s throat\u201d. Another observer described him as a \u201cbeast\u201d, adding: \u201cHe wants to be king of Africa, but he\u2019s just a normal dictator.\u201d On the beach, those working the sands were focused on scraping a meagre income from selling fruit juice, horse rides, hair braiding and themselves. \u201cHey nice lady, what\u2019s your name, where are you from, you like to go dancing?\u201d is the endless soundtrack to a stroll along the Atlantic shore. The tourist season, diminished though it is, has a few more months to run before the rains come and what are known as the \u201chungry months\u201d begin. It doesn\u2019t seem likely that Jammeh\u2019s declaration of an Islamic state is going to solve many of the Gambia\u2019s problems."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/31/katharine-gun-observer-iraq-war-whistleblower-hollywood-film-official-secrets", "publicationDate": "2016-01-31T00:05:12Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "The Observer", "Newspapers", "Media", "Iraq", "GCHQ", "UK news"], "sentences": ["\u201cIt\u2019s really surreal,\u201d Gun, 41, who was born in Taiwan and studied Mandarin and Japanese at Durham University, said last week."], "title": "Hollywood beckons for whistleblower who risked jail over Iraq \u2018dirty tricks\u2019", "article": "Before Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, and Edward Snowden, the intelligence whistleblower, there was Katharine Gun. Not so many people remember the unassuming British woman who once risked it all to take a stand against the US war machine, but that is about to change. The former GCHQ employee will be played by Natalie Dormer, star of The Tudors and Game of Thrones, in a film that continues the big screen\u2019s love affair with spies and journalists. Gun was a young Mandarin specialist at the British government\u2019s eavesdropping agency in Cheltenham. In early 2003 she received an email asking her and her colleagues to help the US government spy on UN security council delegations in New York. It was a critical moment, as Washington was seeking UN backing for its invasion of Iraq. Gun decided the world had to know, whatever the cost to her life and career. She leaked the memo to the Observer and was arrested, lost her job and faced trial under the Official Secrets Act. Thirteen years later, as bloodshed continues in Iraq, the almost forgotten story is to be brought to a new audience in Official Secrets, a movie co-starring Paul Bettany and Martin Freeman as Observer journalists who reported the dirty tricks scandal, along with Anthony Hopkins as a retired general and Harrison Ford as a veteran CIA agent. It will chart Gun\u2019s unlikely bid \u2013 courageous self-sacrifice to supporters, treachery in the view of critics \u2013 to block George W Bush and Tony Blair\u2019s march to war. \u201cIt\u2019s really surreal,\u201d Gun, 41, who was born in Taiwan and studied Mandarin and Japanese at Durham University, said last week. \u201cIt already feels like such a long time ago, like almost a different person, but to have it brought to the big screen \u2013 it will still be really weird.\u201d For director Justin Chadwick, whose credits include The Other Boleyn Girl and Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, there will be the challenge of turning spycraft and journalism into drama. Film-makers keep trying, but some are more successful than others. The Watergate-inspired All the President\u2019s Men is still widely regarded as the gold standard depiction of investigative reporting, while Spotlight, about the Boston Globe\u2019s expos\u00e9 of priests involved in sexual abuse, is nominated at this year\u2019s Oscars. But The Fifth Estate, which starred Benedict Cumberbatch as Assange, was a flop in 2013, costing $28m to make and taking only around $6m worldwide. Oliver Stone\u2019s biopic of Snowden, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, was meant to have been released by now but has been pushed back. Unlike many whistleblowers who leak thousands of documents after the event, Gun was intervening in an active operation and trying to stop a war with just one email. The US National Security Agency memo told employees of GCHQ to gather \u201cthe whole gamut of information that could give American policymakers an edge in obtaining results favourable to US goals or to head off surprises\u201d. This included a focus on the \u201cswing nations\u201d on the security council: Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Bulgaria and Guinea \u201cas well as extra focus on Pakistan UN matters\u201d. Gun did not hesitate. She printed off the memo, put it in her handbag and took it home. \u201cI saw the email and my gut reaction was pretty instantaneous, that it was highly explosive information and that it should be out in the public domain,\u201d she recalled. \u201cEverybody would agree that at the time \u2013 the build-up to the invasion \u2013 the public mood across the globe was very much against an invasion, and that\u2019s how I felt as well. There were no grounds for it, and I really felt that people needed to know what was going on behind the scenes to get a really clear picture of where our governments were taking us.\u201d The Observer had controversially declared its support for the war, but it verified the leak and published the story on 2 March 2003, causing an international storm. The US and UK had to give up on securing a direct UN mandate for attacking Iraq and instead launched airstrikes on 19 March, with far-reaching consequences that included a chaotic insurgency and saw the rise of Islamic State. Gun reflected: \u201cI think the film is important because the issues still haven\u2019t gone away and it\u2019s a good opportunity to focus people\u2019s minds not only on that specific period in time but also on the ramifications of that invasion and how the ripple effect has carried on to this day. The violence, the refugee crisis, Isis \u2013 they\u2019re all intertwined in many ways.\u201d Intriguing questions remain over who ultimately authorised the NSA\u2019s request and whether it was carried out by GCHQ staff. Based on Marcia and Thomas Mitchell\u2019s bestselling book, The Spy Who Tried To Stop A War: Katherine Gun and the Secret Plot to Sanction the Iraq Invasion, the film will try to fill some of the gaps and trace the political forces that led to the conflict. Gun said: \u201cThere was certainly something going on at very senior levels. We know that Tony Blair was principally concerned about his reputation, about the legality of the war. The whole thing stinks to high heaven. I know people have tried to make citizens\u2019 arrests on Tony Blair and so on, but really it\u2019s time the international criminal court has some guts and charges white war criminals. They need to face justice just like other war criminals. I would support Bush and Blair being impeached.\u201d The personal cost to her was immense. After the story broke, she owned up to her bosses and was arrested. The government\u2019s decision to charge her came as a \u201cshock\u201d, she recalled, and she faced a possible jail term. But as she sat in the Old Bailey awaiting the first day of her trial in 2004, the case was suddenly dropped after the prosecution withdrew its evidence. Some believe the government was anxious to avoid the embarrassment of a lengthy court case as, in the absence of weapons of mass destruction, its argument for going to war was beginning to unravel. Gun has since kept a low profile and now lives in Turkey with her husband and seven-year-old daughter. She applauded Assange and Snowden for resisting an ever-worsening climate of official secrecy and has never regretted what she did. \u201cIt most certainly did change my life completely, but of course you don\u2019t know how things would have panned out otherwise because I didn\u2019t travel down that road. It\u2019s been a completely different trajectory from what I envisaged, but I\u2019m still here and just trying to lead a relatively normal life.\u201d This will also be a newspaper film. Bettany, whose CV includes A Beautiful Mind, Iron Man and Wimbledon, plays Martin Bright, the Observer journalist who came into possession of the NSA memo after meeting a contact in a cafe. Bright, now 49, from north London, said: \u201cI was, I have to admit, sceptical. It was essentially just a sheet of paper with some words typed on it, but I had a feeling that it looked like it wasn\u2019t made up.\u201d So he and two colleagues, Ed Vulliamy and Peter Beaumont, worked their contacts for a long time to stand the story up. \u201cBy the time we published we were 99% sure, but we were still having some steers from official sources that this might be a sophisticated Russian forgery, and you have to remember the time this was happening was extremely fraught ... There are a lot of risks involved and if you get something like this wrong, and if it had been a forgery or attempt to discredit the Observer, it would have been terrible for all of us.\u201d Bright, now a political commentator and founder of a youth employment charity, admires Gun\u2019s determination to expose wrongdoing. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt it was an act of immense bravery for a young woman to take the decision to leak a document of such intense sensitivity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was, at the time, the highest-level leak ever.\u201d Screenwriters Sara and Gregory Bernstein, a California-based husband and wife, said they were drawn to the story by the courage of people like Gun and Bright and his colleagues. \u201cOf course, once we started investigating further, we knew we had not only characters, but an explosive story. The facts here demonstrate how vulnerable we are when government officials knowingly twist information to satisfy an agenda they may sincerely believe is important.\u201d The script had circulated in Hollywood for years, but producer Elizabeth Fowler is confident that shooting will begin in April or May, with 33-year-old Dormer in the role of Gun. It is, she believes, a tale that needs to be told. \u201cIt is ultimately a very heroic story about a young woman who finds the courage and has the moral compass to do the right thing, solely at risk to her,\u201d she said. \u201cRisk only: no gain. I think that\u2019s a tremendously inspiring thing. She said, \u2018I\u2019ve only ever followed my conscience\u2019. Every time I hear that, tears spring up.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/feb/01/nestle-slavery-thailand-fighting-child-labour-lawsuit-ivory-coast", "publicationDate": "2016-02-01T05:00:18Z", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Thailand", "Seafood", "Slavery", "Asia Pacific", "Life and style", "World news"], "sentences": ["Last year Verit\u00e9 was involved in another exercise in self-disclosure by outdoor clothing company Patagonia, which announced that it had discovered several points in its supply chain in Taiwan where forced labour and unethical recruitment practices were flourishing."], "title": "Nestl\u00e9 admits slavery in Thailand while fighting child labour lawsuit in Ivory Coast", "article": "It\u2019s hard to think of an issue that you would less like your company to be associated with than modern slavery.

Nick Grono, the chief executive of NGO the Freedom Fund, which has invested heavily in anti-trafficking initiatives in Thailand, believes Nestl\u00e9\u2019s admission could be a considerable force in shifting the parameters of what can be expected of businesses when it comes to supply chain accountability.  \u201cNestl\u00e9\u2019s decision to conduct this investigation is to be applauded,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got one of the biggest brands in the world proactively coming out and admitting that they have found slavery in their business operations, then it\u2019s potentially a huge game-changer and could lead to real and sustained change in how supply chains are managed.\u201d The research (pdf) for Nestl\u00e9\u2019s report was conducted by US corporate accountability business Verit\u00e9, which works closely with organisations trying to help improve their supply chain transparency.  Last year Verit\u00e9 was involved in another exercise in self-disclosure by outdoor clothing company Patagonia, which announced that it had discovered several points in its supply chain in Taiwan where forced labour and unethical recruitment practices were flourishing. Verite\u2019s chief executive, Dan Viederman, said: \u201cIn the last six months Verit\u00e9 has been involved in two high-profile disclosures from major brands and one of the most important lessons for us to recognise is that in neither case did the companies suffer greatly in terms of being associated with these labour conditions. Instead, they received some credit [for] being bold enough to be associated with this.\u201d  \u201cI really hope that the recent examples help mobilise companies to be bolder and investigate more deeply because soon the reputational damage in not doing so could be considerable\u201d For Viederman, the biggest issue is working out how to manage the disclosures into actual change for vulnerable people trapped at the bottom of global commodity chains.    Related: The UK's new slavery laws explained: what do they mean for business?    Cleaning up the supply chain There is also a growing legal imperative for many large multinationals to start seriously engaging with labour abuses in their business operations. Legislation in both the US and the UK  requires larger companies to publish annual reports on their efforts to keep their businesses slavery-free. The success of the 2010 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act has been patchy but it has spawned a series of civil litigation suits, with consumers or workers using the legislation to launch legal actions against companies they accuse of making misleading public statements on their anti-slavery efforts. Nestl\u00e9 is one of the companies facing legal action in the US. Last week the company, along with Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland, failed in its bid to get the US Supreme Court to throw out a lawsuit seeking to hold them liable for the alleged use of child slaves in cocoa farming in the Ivory Coast.  This puts the company in the unfortunate position of disclosing slavery in one part of its operations, while at the same time fighting through the courts to fend off accusations that it exists in another \u2013 more profitable \u2013 part of its business.    By the time Nestl\u00e9 owned up to slavery in the Thai seafood industry it was accepted knowledge  Andrew Wallis     Andrew Wallis, chief executive of Unseen UK, an anti-trafficking charity advocating for more supply chain accountability, said: \u201cFor me there is a big issue with one part of Nestl\u00e9 saying, \u2018OK we have been dragged along with everyone else to face the issue of slavery in Thailand and so let\u2019s take the initiative and do something about it\u2019, and at the same time fighting tooth and nail through the courts to avoid charges of child slavery in its core operations in the Ivory Coast.\u201d He argues that Nestl\u00e9\u2019s self-reporting could also be seen as a tactic to head off or deflate other pending civil litigation suits. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to own up to something that has already been uncovered,\u201d he says. \u201cBy the time Nestl\u00e9 owned up to slavery in the Thai seafood industry it was accepted knowledge. It\u2019ll be a brave new world when companies are actually doing the real investigation to probe into part of their supply chains that have remained outside the public domain.  \u201cWe need to move into a space where we say, \u2018We\u2019re all guilty; let\u2019s get past that to a place where we can properly address the problem\u2019 \u2013 and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet.\u201d Sign up for the Guardian sustainable business newsletter to receive more stories like this in your inbox."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/03/japan-spend-billions-yen-tiny-okinotori-islands-1000-miles-south-of-tokyo", "publicationDate": "2016-02-03T11:16:12Z", "tags": ["Japan", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["Okinotorishima   Located roughly midway between Taiwan and the US territory of Guam, the atoll \u2013 which measures just 4.5km east to west and 1.7km north to south \u2013 is also of rising strategic importance amid tensions over China\u2019s claims to the Senkakus and its island-building project in the South China Sea.", "Chinese vessels are thought to have mapped the surrounding seabed in anticipation of submarine operations against incoming US ships in the event of a conflict, most likely over Taiwan."], "title": "Japan to spend millions on tiny islands 1,000 miles south of Tokyo", "article": "As far as China is concerned, they are mere chunks of uninhabitable rock. But for Japan, these tiny specks in the Pacific, collectively known as \u201cdistant bird island\u201d, serve as a key economic and strategic outpost at a time of growing concern over Chinese military activity in the region. Japan announced this week it would spend 13bn yen (\u00a375m) to rebuild an observation post on the remote island of Okinotorishima, located about 1,000 miles south of Tokyo \u2013 a move that could reignite a long-running dispute over maritime territory between Tokyo and Beijing. In recent years, Okinotorishima has been largely overlooked while the north-east Asian rivals clashed diplomatically over sovereignty of the Senkaku islands in the East China Sea. While China has never laid claim to Okinotorishima, Japan\u2019s decision to devote such large sums to the atoll\u2019s upkeep will not be welcomed in Beijing. The area contains rich fishing grounds, potentially huge deposits of oil and other energy resources, as well as rare metals.   Okinotorishima   Located roughly midway between Taiwan and the US territory of Guam, the atoll \u2013 which measures just 4.5km east to west and 1.7km north to south \u2013 is also of rising strategic importance amid tensions over China\u2019s claims to the Senkakus and its island-building project in the South China Sea. Chinese vessels are thought to have mapped the surrounding seabed in anticipation of submarine operations against incoming US ships in the event of a conflict, most likely over Taiwan. Beijing has long insisted that Okinotorishima comprises rocks \u2013 not islands \u2013 that are unable to sustain human life and should not, therefore, be used by Japan to expand its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which extends for 200 nautical miles around the atoll. The United Nations convention on the law of the sea defines an island as \u201ca naturally formed area of land, surrounded by water, which is above water at high tide\u201d. The convention states that \u201crocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone\u201d. That is why Japan has not followed China\u2019s example in the South China Sea and created manmade islands with thousands of tonnes of sand and concrete; instead, it has tried to prevent existing coral beds from disappearing beneath the ocean, taking its EEZ with them. Since the late 1980s, it has spent roughly $600m (\u00a3415m) building steel breakwaters and concrete casings to prevent erosion of two islets that protrude from the water at low tide; a third visible islet is covered by a titanium net to protect it from debris created by the waves. It also constructed a three-storey observatory that monitors ships in the area and sends data to land ministry. A ministry official told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper that the observatory needed urgent repair work before it collapsed due to erosion and regular poundings from typhoons.  \u201cRebuilding the facility is a necessary step to help preserve the site,\u201d the unnamed official said. \u201cWe hope to start working on the construction as soon as possible.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/07/taiwan-earthquake-rescuers-race-to-save-dozens-trapped-under-rubble", "publicationDate": "2016-02-07T12:34:59Z", "tags": ["Taiwan", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Earthquakes", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Rescuers in the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan were fighting against the clock on Sunday to save more than 100 people still trapped beneath rubble of an apartment block 24 hours after a strong earthquake shook the island.", "Related: Taiwan earthquake: death toll rises with dozens trapped in toppled building    A 20-year-old man was pulled alive from of the wreckage on Sunday but the city\u2019s mayor admitted that emergency teams face a \u201cvery difficult\u201d challenge to rescue dozens of other people who remain trapped."], "title": "Rescuers race to save dozens trapped under rubble of Taiwan earthquake", "article": "Rescuers in the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan were fighting against the clock on Sunday to save more than 100 people still trapped beneath rubble of an apartment block 24 hours after a strong earthquake shook the island.

Even though the commercial was first launched in 2011, this story of reclaiming a zest for life has had its own renaissance on social media over the past few weeks. What makes content shareable, even years after it\u2019s been initially released? What is it about this kind of content that causes such a powerful reaction \u2013 and prompts an audience to tell their friends and family about it?   Perhaps it\u2019s content that evokes empathy, spurs thinking and provides meaning. Snackable content \u2013 the addictive, instantly gratifying kind \u2013 may boost media consumption but doesn\u2019t tend to change minds and behaviors. Content that resonates more deeply is different: users share it not with the one friend who might appreciate it, but with their entire network \u2013 partly because it associates them with the topic. Bob Gilbreath, author of The Next Evolution of Marketing, says the same is true for brands \u2013 they need to not just do meaningful marketing, such as cause marketing, but make marketing itself meaningful. If brands\u2019 messages can add meaningful value to the lives of those who receive them, then those messages will be shared \u2013 effecting change not just in the consumer but in their community too. Here are a few textbook examples of big brands using meaningful messages that spawned empathy and action: Adele\u2019s 25  The bestselling album from last year, Adele\u2019s 25 smashed records on every level, including the highest first week album sales in both the US and the UK, as well as the most-watched video in 24 hours for Hello, among others. In stating that each of her age albums (the trilogy of 19, 21 and 25) is a snapshot of her experience during that year of her life, she strengthens the connection her fans feel to her and for her.  Buzz around the launch of 25 was fuelled by a free concert in New York\u2019s Radio City Music Hall days before the album dropped. Televised online shortly after, the gig showcased the frenzy of excitement her fans felt about the album\u2019s release. She also took part in a video of an Adele impersonator contest that has been viewed a staggering 43.8 million times. It all helped send sales through the roof. Inside Out at the Puppy Bowl One of the biggest films of last year was Inside Out, Pixar\u2019s poignant journey into emotions. As part of the film\u2019s promotional push, characters representing our primary emotions \u2013 Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and Anger \u2013 gave a play-by-play commentary on Animal Planet network\u2019s Puppy Bowl, which is broadcast opposite the NFL Super Bowl every year. Placing these animated characters in the middle of an actual live event encouraged empathy from viewers and prompted them to think mindfully about their own emotions \u2013 and go and see the film, of course. Serial: season one podcast  This spinoff of NPR\u2019s This American Life proved to be the podcast that catapulted the genre back into the mainstream. Not only did it grow wildly popular as the murder mystery unfolded, but it also helped to reopen what some considered a flawed case against the convicted murderer, Adnan Syed.  The level of empathy the audience had for the people involved became borderline obsessive, made evident by the millions that listened, dissected and discussed the episodes online and off. Some even took matters into their own hands and sent Sarah Koenig, the host and producer, tips to help discover the truth. The listeners were also forced to face tough questions of character, such as if anyone, including themselves, could be capable of heinous crimes given the right circumstances. Regardless of the type of content that artists, brands and publishers create today, a meaningful authentic story can draw in an audience that could otherwise be critical and desensitized. The more the content focuses on the values that a brand (be it Adele, Pixar or Serial) and its audience hold dear, the more solid the relationship it builds with its audience \u2013 no small achievement especially in our constantly shifting landscape of content consumption."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/feb/08/global-outlook-lgbti-rights", "publicationDate": "2016-02-08T12:48:09Z", "tags": ["Global development professionals network", "Russia", "Morocco", "Uganda", "Brunei", "Syria", "Nigeria", "The Gambia", "Africa", "Asia Pacific", "Europe", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "LGBT rights", "Cameroon", "Egypt", "Senegal"], "sentences": ["Taiwan has just elected its first women president, a supporter of same-sex marriage, in a country where marriage equality has more than two-thirds public support."], "title": "Where are we now?

Several Commonwealth countries stipulate life imprisonment: Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Pakistan, Uganda, Bangladesh and Guyana. There have also been new laws enacted in some countries, most excessively in Nigeria, which has outlawed LGBTI organisations, fundraising and public advocacy \u2013 and even gay-focused HIV prevention, and LGBT-themed books and movies.

Hate rhetoric is fuelling homophobic mob violence \u2013 sometimes perpetrated by right-wing death squads \u2013 especially in Honduras, Brazil, Mexico, Peru and El Salvador. Six Honduran LGBTI activists have been assassinated since last summer. A disproportionately high number of victims of anti-LGBTI violence are trans people. The Trans Murder Monitoring Project reports that over 1,300 trans and gender-diverse women and men were murdered in Latin America from 2008-14.  In recent years, the Indian and Singaporean courts have upheld the criminalisation of same-sex relations (that decision in India was recently referred back to the supreme court), and Burundi has outlawed homosexuality for the first time it its history. In Syria, Isis is targeting LGBTI people for execution, mostly by being thrown off tall buildings and in neighbouring Iraq, Shia militias are also waging a terror campaign against LGBTI people. Despite backlash, the trend is towards greater equality Despite this bleak picture, in the overwhelming majority of the world\u2019s 193 countries, the trend is towards ever greater LGBTI acceptance and equality. In recent years, we\u2019ve seen the decriminalisation of gay sex in Palau, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, northern Cyprus and Mozambique. The Seychelles has pledged to repeal its anti-gay laws, though it has not yet done so. A Ugandan court annulled the notorious anti-homosexuality act, albeit on a technicality. The new bill to replace it has never been legislated. Vietnam lifted the ban on same-sex marriage in 2015, as a prelude to its expected eventual legalisation.

Taiwan has just elected its first women president, a supporter of same-sex marriage, in a country where marriage equality has more than two-thirds public support. The first openly lesbian cabinet minister has taken office in South Africa and two men who were prosecuted for being gay in Zambia were acquitted at their trial. Both the UN\u2019s human rights council and the African Commission on Human and People\u2019s Rights passed resolutions in 2014 calling on all countries to protect their LGBTI communities from discrimination and violence. Research by the Williams Institute has found rising global acceptance of same-sex relations, including in developing countries: \u201cLatin America acceptance of homosexuality ranges from a high of 34% in Uruguay to a low of 2% in Ecuador. On the legal recognition for marriages for same-sex couples, Uruguay has the highest level of support at 57% while Guatemala has the lowest level of support at 12%. In Africa, acceptance of homosexuality ranges from a high of 38% in South Africa to a low of 2% in Ghana.\u201d These figures are still quite low but nonetheless a big improvement on a decade ago.

Part of it he describes as cultural, the guilt he feels for disappointing his family. \u201cI\u2019m their shame,\u201d he says. There are approximately 3,000 inmates at San Quentin, all male. California\u2019s oldest prison, the cluster of buildings occupies a peninsula that juts into the northern part of the San Francisco Bay, about 20 miles north of the city. Though it\u2019s perhaps best known for housing California\u2019s only death row and execution chamber, most of the prison is \u201cLevel 2\u201d security, meaning inmates are free to move throughout the facility during the day.  \u2018The Super Bowl is just the biggest\u2019     Chung Kao: \u2018I don\u2019t think I deserve to be happy.\u2019 Photograph: Will Whipple for the Guardian    There are two types of housing for non-death-row inmates at San Quentin: cell blocks on top of the hill and dorms below. The dorms are largely inhabited by inmates with less than 10 years to go on their sentences. The cell blocks are full of lifers.  As the first half of the game gets under way, the residents of North Block are all in their cells, startlingly small rooms with bunk beds, toilets, sinks, personal belongings, and two people shoehorned inside. Usually the block would be empty at this time of day, Juan Haines says, but everyone has returned to their cells to watch the game.  Haines spends much of his time down the hill at the San Quentin News office \u2013 he\u2019s the managing editor \u2013 but today is an exception.  \u201cMy Super Bowl day is usually in my cell. I cook with my cellie,\u201d he says, referring to his cell-mate. \u201cIt\u2019s like family time.\u201d  The Super Bowl spread is indeed impressive. Haines and his cell-mate have prepared rice with meat logs, oysters, clams, garlic, onions, peppers, Velveeta, and spices. They\u2019re also dining on fried chicken and corn chips.  \u201cWe have big events in prison,\u201d Haines says, such as the Day of Peace, which commemorates a 2007 race riot every May, and the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer in July. \u201cBut the Super Bowl is just the biggest.\u201d      Inmates watch the Super Bowl in the San Quentin News office. Photograph: Will Whipple for the Guardian    For some inmates, the Super Bowl is bittersweet. Charles David Henry is one of the men hanging out in the newspaper office to give the game his full attention. A lifelong Oakland Raiders fan, Henry has been in prison for 11 years on an attempted murder charge, though he says: \u201cI didn\u2019t do it.\u201d He played football in college at California State University-Los Angeles \u2013 \u201cI was quick and fast and loved to hit\u201d \u2013 and used to drive up to Oakland from his home in LA in an RV to attend games.  \u201cIt sort of hurts a little bit,\u201d he says. \u201cYou miss so many things that you take for granted on the streets. San Francisco is a rock\u2019s throw from us, but we can\u2019t participate.\u201d  These days, he\u2019s the newspaper\u2019s \u201cdeath row man\u201d. Reporters from the San Quentin News are not allowed to interview death row inmates, but Henry uses the library to read up on their cases and file briefs if he thinks they are warranted. He takes inspiration from Al Davis, the former owner and general manager of the Raiders.  \u201cAl Davis is my guy,\u201d he says, \u201cHe never took what the system gave him. He always challenged it.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s nice to get lost in something\u2019 There\u2019s a more traditional feel to the Super Bowl festivities in H-Unit, the dormitory-style wards at the bottom of the hill. Here, many of the inmates are younger, and they measure their sentences in months, not years.    Related: Super Bowl 50: the newspaper front pages \u2013 in pictures    In building five, about 100 men are housed in the bunk beds clustered at either end of the large, open room. In the middle of the room, a guard watches over several rows of wooden benches that face two televisions, and the open bathrooms behind them.  It\u2019s just like watching a sporting event with any other crowd of men, only quieter. Inmates have to plug their own earphones into the benches to hear the sound. Men joke about the presence of reporters (\u201cDamn, people love this prison. It\u2019s a tourist attraction\u201d), Chris Martin (\u201cthey got a daughter named Apple\u201d), and the commercials.      Prisoners use their earphones in H-unit.

Danyel McGee is mocked for singing along to Coldplay during the half-time show (\u201cHe likes Macklemore,\u201d one inmate jokes. \u201cI do like Macklemore,\u201d McGee replies.) Another inmate takes his earphones off while Coldplay performs \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie, I\u2019m not feeling this,\u201d he says \u2013 but everyone sits up and pays attention when Beyonc\u00e9 takes the stage.  In the corner of the room, in the last row of bunk beds, Wayne, who asked not to be identified by his last name, is watching the game on his bed, alone. A cheery, middle-aged prisoner, he\u2019s in prison for gross negligence vehicular manslaughter \u2013 killing someone while driving drunk. \u201cOn the street, we always had a big party with friends for the Super Bowl,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was almost like Thanksgiving.\u201d  But he\u2019s not in the mood to join the party in the middle of the room. \u201cI enjoy being alone in prison. It\u2019s nice to get lost in something,\u201d he says.  But he likes the commercials, and he likes to watch the game.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re in prison, time is measured differently. Every day is Groundhog Day,\u201d he says. \u201cSo these games are more of a milestone. You notice a full moon. You notice a Super Bowl.\u201d  Wayne lies back down on his bed and starts to put his earphones back in. \u201cThis is my fourth Super Bowl in prison.\u201d "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/09/panic-situation-as-asian-stocks-tumble-amid-fears-of-new-global-recession", "publicationDate": "2016-02-09T07:20:03Z", "tags": ["Stock markets", "Business", "Japan", "Nikkei", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China"], "sentences": ["Markets in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea were closed for Lunar New Year holidays."], "title": "'Panic situation': Asian stocks tumble amid fears of new global recession", "article": "Japan\u2019s Nikkei index plummeted more than 950 points on Tuesday, its biggest loss in one day since May 2013, as the fears over the global economy saw a continuation of the previous day\u2019s selloff in Europe and the US.

Is the global economy about to crash? \u2013 video explainer    After hovering around the 117-yen line on Monday, the Japanese currency briefly rose to the upper 114 zone to its strongest level against the dollar since November 2014. Investors regard the yen as a \u201csave haven\u201d currency when global markets are hit by the kind of turmoil witnessed in recent weeks. The yen is expected to make further gains \u2013 a trend that eats into the repatriated profits of Japanese auto and other exporters. Three-month dollar/yen implied volatility \u2013 which indicates how much currency movement is expected in the months ahead - reached 12.137% its highest since September 2013. Responding to the yen\u2019s rise, Japan\u2019s finance minister, Taro Aso, told reporters: \u201cIt is clear that recent moves in the market have been rough. We will continue to carefully monitor developments in the currency market.\u201d The dollar was last at 115.26 yen, down 0.6%, after dropping as low as 114.75. Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo, described it as a \u201cpanic situation\u201d. Ogino added that investors would be closely watching the US federal reserve chair Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony to the house financial services committee on Wednesday for any clues that the central bank might be prepared to slow future rate hikes as market turbulence and global economic uncertainty continue. \u201cThe focus is now on Yellen\u2019s comments tomorrow, and how she\u2019ll respond to these latest market conditions,\u201d Ogino said. The flight to safety also saw Japanese government bond yields dive below zero for the first time, extending a downtrend sparked by the Bank of Japan\u2019s surprise move last month to adopt negative interest rates on some commercial lenders\u2019 deposits. \u201cThe Nikkei has been well and truly savaged today,\u201d said Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at IG in Melbourne. \u201cIt is clear that strong buying in the Japanese government bond market is not going to drive the (yen) weaker in times of extreme volatility, so negative rates have little bearing on markets.\u201d The Bank of Japan\u2019s rates decision has prompted fears that after years of monetary easing, central banks have few avenues left to explore to encourage investment and boost growth. Talk of an impending recession in the US, however, is creating speculation among investors that the federal reserve will put on hold its attempts to normalise rates. \u201cThe \u2018fear factor\u2019 in markets has morphed from being about an emerging market hard-landing and collapsing oil prices to being about the extent of the slowdown in the developed world and the ability of central banks to reflate asset values yet again,\u201d said analysts at Citi in a note. The pessimism isn\u2019t universal, however. In a report released at the weekend, Goldman Sachs said there was just a 25% risk that recession would hit industrialised economies in the next year, rising to 34% over the next two years. Both forecasts fall below the average risk seen in the past 35 years, despite the turmoil in financial markets. In the US, the probability of a recession in the next four quarters is just 18%, and 24 in the eurozone, according to the US bank\u2019s economics team."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/09/satellite-eye-on-earth-january-2016-in-pictures", "publicationDate": "2016-02-09T11:16:56Z", "tags": ["Environment", "Space", "World news", "Science", "Coastlines", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Climate change", "Flooding", "Desertification", "Solar power", "Oceans", "Deserts", "Wildfires", "Rivers", "Pollution", "Coral", "Energy", "Marine life", "Renewable energy"], "sentences": ["Snow also fell in areas of Taiwan, western and central Japan, and mainland China."], "title": "Satellite Eye on Earth: January 2016 - in pictures", "article": "In orbit around the Earth on board the International Space Station, Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly captured this blue water image and tweeted it out with this message: \u201c A splash of #EarthArt over the #Bahamas! #YearInSpace.\u201d     Credits: Sentinel-2A/ESA    Part of Sierra Leone in west Africa.

Globally averaged temperatures in 2015 shattered the previous mark set in 2014 by 0.23F (0.13C).  The 2015 temperatures continue a long-term warming trend, according to analyses by scientists. The planet\u2019s average surface temperature has risen about 1.8F (1C) since the late-19th century, a change largely driven by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere. Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with 15 of the 16 warmest years on record occurring since 2001.  Phenomena such as El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a, which warm or cool the tropical Pacific Ocean, can contribute to short-term variations in global average temperature.

The astronaut might even be able to tell the difference between the long curved lines on the left of the image. One is an ancient shoreline formed when the lake contained permanent water and had waves strong enough to shape sediments into a smooth beach. The other curved, slightly irregular line is a harder rock layer protruding from the desert floor.

Blooms show up this time of year in the Arabian Sea because of the winter monsoon. Winds shift from south-westerly to north-easterly, stirring up currents that bring nutrients up from the depths and out from coastal tributaries. The change in wind direction also picks up dust from the arid lands of south-western Asia, carrying it out over the sea. This dust contains mineral nutrients that phytoplankton need to fuel their growth. Dust storms help fertilise the ocean.

Credits: MODIS/Terra/NASA    As is often the case in winter, a thick river of haze hovered over the Indo-Gangetic Plain in January 2016, darkening skies over northern India and Bangladesh.  The haze likely resulted from a combination of urban and industrial pollution, agricultural and cooking fires, and a meteorological phenomenon known as a temperature inversion. Usually the air higher in the atmosphere is cooler than the air near the surface, a situation that allows warm air to rise and disperse pollutants. However, cold air often settles over northern India in the winter, trapping pollution near the surface, where it has the greatest effect on human health. Air pollution has emerged as a significant issue in India. Satellite observations show that levels of both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are rising. A recent World Health Organisation analysis of particulate pollution concluded that many of the world\u2019s most polluted cities were in India. Meanwhile, New Delhi, India\u2019s capital city, began an experiment to keep half of vehicles off the road for the first two weeks of January in an attempt to curb air pollution.

Mozambique is known for having a more relaxed attitude to homosexuality than some other African countries, with Joaquim Chissano, the former president, pointing to the social cost of homophobia in 2014: \u201cWe can no longer afford to discriminate against people on the basis of age, sex, ethnicity, migrant status, sexual orientation and gender identity, or any other basis \u2013 we need to unleash the full potential of everyone.\u201d However, Lambda, the country\u2019s only gay rights organisation, which fought for the law change and provide counselling, legal assistance and health advice, is still waiting for official recognition from the government after lobbying them for seven years. Registration would mean access to funding and tax exemption status, and would be another step towards acceptance for the country\u2019s LGBT community. \u201cThat is the battle we have next,\u201d said Carina Capitine, spokesperson for Lambda. \u201cA lot of people are asking about marriage or adoption but we can\u2019t think about that yet. Our registration is the key thing for us. We are all pushing and believe we will have it soon.\u201d     Nepalese transgender people get ready for a performance to mark the International day against homophobia in Kathmandu, Nepal. Photograph: Narendra Shrestha/EPA    Nepal Nepal has been on path to recognising the rights of its LGBT community since the country\u2019s civil conflict ended in 2006. But last year, the Himalayan country made history when it joined only a handful of countries in recognising a third gender on passports. The landmark decision allowed transgender people to mark their passport with an O for indeterminate gender, instead of an M or F. It\u2019s important because it allows individuals to self-identify their gender rather than relying on what was put on their birth certificate, and it recognises the rights of hijras, a transgender community who have a long cultural history in Nepal. Even more significant than recent achievements for trans rights. Last September, the traditionally conservative nation enshrined protections for LGBT people in it\u2019s constitution. The Human Rights Campaign in Asia called it \u201ca historic first for a nation in Asia\u201d. Sunil Babu Pant, LGBT rights campaigner and Nepal\u2019s first openly gay MP, has been instrumental in making this progress. Human Rights Watch researcher Kyle Knight points out, Nepal is in many ways a long way from realising many of its human rights obligations, but in the case of its LGBT citizens it appears to be on a path to progress. Taiwan   Related: Electric shocks, rape and submersion: 'gay cures' and the fight to end them    Activists in Taiwan are cautiously optimistic that the next few years will see further expansion of LGBT rights as the country. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely positive for us is that our newly-elected president personally supports same-sex marriage but it\u2019s still not clear whether the marriage equality bill will become law,\u201d adds Victoria Hsu, chief executive officer of the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights. \u201cThis is because there are some small religious groups, that while only minorities, are very strong opponents with a lot of money and political influence.\u201d Hsu says the progress made at local government level is encouraging. Same-sex couples can now record their partnerships at household registration offices in Taipei. This gives gay couples the chance to assert their rights in some situations, such as being able to give consent if their partner needs emergency surgery. Hsu is currently lobbying Taipei\u2019s politicians to go a step further, asking them to give same-sex couples the same social housing rights as straight couples and to open up equal opportunities for government employees. Hsu acknowledges the community still faces significant challenges though: \u201cSome people think because we\u2019ve got the biggest gay pride event in Asia, Taiwan must be the most gay friendly place in Asia but that\u2019s an illusion in a sense \u2013 we\u2019ve still got problems with the police, who traditionally link the gay community to drugs, some politicians, and a lot of people protesting against gay marriage.\u201d     Supporters and members of the LGBT community march in Hanoi, Vietnam. Photograph: KHAM/Reuters    Vietnam \u201cOn gay rights, Vietnam is now more progressive than America\u201d, was the headline posted by NBC News last January. While that sentiment may be a little premature, LGBT rights have certainly improved in the south-east Asian country in recent years. Gay marriage is tolerated by the state, though same-sex couples don\u2019t enjoy the same rights as straight people. Last summer, a gay pride event in Nguyen Hue which attracted thousands of people was described Australian outlet ABC as feeling like a \u201cLGBT Disneyland\u201d; despite fears that the celebration would be repressed by the authoritarian government. There were other signs too of Vietnam\u2019s increasingly liberal attitude to LGBT issues in 2015, particularly when the country passed a law in December which would allow individuals who have undergone reassignment surgery to register under a new gender.   Related: Live Q&amp;A: How is progress on LGBT rights achieved?    But Vietnam has some way to go before Ho Chi Minh City resembles Brighton seafront on an average weekend. In 2014, a report on LGBT rights in Vietnam found that conservative views on sexuality remained across the country, despite a plethora of LGBT support groups springing up in urban areas. The report states: \u201cLGBT people are discriminated against, physically and psychologically assaulted, abandoned, and \u2018cured\u2019 by their family by many harmful methods that involve mental and physical abuse. They are forced to get married to those who they do not love, which can lead to the breakdown of marriages after a short period of time, further damaging the image of LGBT people.\u201d  From 8-14 February the Guardian Global Development Professionals Network is highlighting the work of the LGBT rights activists throughout the world.

The passport was the latest in a string of victories for the country increasingly highlighted as a leader in transgender rights. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that citizens were entitled to select their gender identity based on \u201cself feeling\u201d. Soon after, the Nepal Election Commission began allowing voters, who do not identify themselves as either male or female, to register as a third gender. In 2011, the Nepal Census was the first attempt by any national government to count its people by three genders. For Bhumika, landing in Taiwan was a victory both political and deeply personal. \u201cI felt so happy holding that piece of paper,\u201d she says. \u201cFor so long I had fought for my right to my identity. It was a very proud moment.\u201d The journey to Taiwan took the 28-year-old far from her hometown of Naikap, and a long way from the identity she was assigned at birth \u2013 as a boy named Kailash. She has fond memories of her early childhood in what was then a small, conservative village in west of the Kathmandu valley: \u201cI remember as a child wearing dresses with my sisters, and playing with \u2018girls\u2019\u2019 toys. My parents were always very supportive.\u201d     Hijras have long cultural history in Nepal and neighbouring Pakistan and India. Photograph: Declan Walsh    It was at the age of 11 that things became more complicated. \u201cI didn\u2019t yet know what the word transgender meant, but at that point I started to feel different from other children,\u201d says Bhumika. \u201cAround then I started getting called derogatory names like \u2018Hijra\u2019 and \u2018Chakka\u2019.\u201d The bullying increased \u2013 walking down the street started to become difficult. \u201cSome teachers turned a blind eye, others told me that if I was going to behave like a girl I shouldn\u2019t come to school.\u201d At 16, she dropped out: \u201cI felt so bad and so alone.\u201d   Related: Bisi Alimi on LGBT rights in Nigeria: 'It may take 60 years, but we have to start now'    Within a few years, Bhumika, the rural dropout, had become the face and voice of Nepal\u2019s transgender movement. She soon became involved with the Blue Diamond Society, an NGO set up in 2001 to campaign for LGBT rights in Nepal. Meeting the group\u2019s campaigners was a huge emotional relief. \u201cI used to think I was the only person in the world that was different,\u201d says Bhumika. These emerging friendships were also the making of an activist: \u201cI started to learn about human rights \u2013 and how mine had been violated.\u201d Starting as a peer educator, she then went on to organise events for the NGO and speak out on transgender issues. A triumph for \u2018third gender\u2019 The \u201cthird gender\u201d identity \u2013 which Bhumika proudly holds on her passport \u2013 is often used as an umbrella term (pdf) to refer to sexual and gender minorities broadly, including many other terms specific to Nepali culture and the many languages spoken in the country. While it is by no means one that all of the transgender community identify with, Kyle Knight, a researcher on the LGBT rights programme at Human Rights Watch, argues that legal recognition of a third gender should be seen as a massive political victory. \u201cIn line with the Yogyakarta Principles, it enshrines the idea that gender recognition should be based on self-identification \u2013 not what the courts or medical professionals say,\u201d he says. In countries such as Malaysia, Kuwait and Nigeria there are laws prohibiting anyone \u201cposing\u201d as the opposite sex. Hijras (generally transgender women) have a long social history in Nepal and neighbouring countries and Knight believes this history influenced the judges\u2019 ruling on a third gender. Legislative progress on transgender rights has also been made in India and Pakistan, where hijras are also present. That historic visibility was usually confined to art and performance, however, and they were marginalised from the mainstream. \u201cIt was spatially discriminatory \u2013 you can exist as long as you stay over there,\u201d says Knight.    Related: Where are we now? The global outlook for LGBTI rights    Miss Pink turns to politics Ironically, the pivotal turning point in Bhumika\u2019s career was seizing this cultural space and occupying it on her own terms. \u201cEntering Nepal\u2019s first Miss Pink transgender beauty pageant in 2007 changed everything,\u201d she says. \u201cGrowing up I had always been fascinated by watching Miss Nepal and Miss World.\u201d For Bhumika the pageant was political: winning was part-childhood dream, part-campaign victory. \u201cI saw it as an awareness-raising opportunity to tell people about transgender rights,\u201d says Bhumika. The profile generated by Miss Pink increased the traction of her advocacy work. Shortly after she was the first transgender person to take a seat in Nepal\u2019s congress.  \u201cBhumika\u2019s contribution to the movement has been immense,\u201d says Sunil Pant, founder of the Blue Diamond Society and the country\u2019s first openly gay politician. \u201cOver the past 15 years of campaigning, the transgender community has gone from being treated as outcasts to being recognised constitutionally and legally.\u201d  One of the most remarkable things about the Nepal LGBT movement, says Knight, is that it came of age during a civil war and found its footing in the aftermath. \u201cLGBT activists joined in protests against the monarchy and contributed to the conversations about what a \u2018new Nepal\u2019 should look like \u2013 this gave them a huge amount of social legitimacy.\u201d     \u201cGai Jatra\u201d Pride in Kathmandu in 2013. The LGBT movement emerged during the civil war in Nepal. Photograph: Kyle Knight    But Bhumika is aware that it will take more than a passport to arrive at equal rights. \u201cWe have travel documents and identity cards now, but it is not enough,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need equal opportunities in education and employment, and access to healthcare.\u201d Transgender people in Nepal suffer high rates of harassment and economic vulnerability, according to research (pdf), and globally a disproportionately high number of victims of violence are trans people.  Despite the recent progress, many Nepali transgender people still experience difficulties in realising their legal status. \u201cWhile Nepal is a beacon of progress, the day-to-day experience of changing documents for some transgender people continues to be unpleasant due to the poor behaviour of bureaucrats,\u201d says Knight.   Related: Six countries making progress on LGBT rights    Coming home and moving forward Yet Bhumika believes there is reason to be optimistic. After all the pageants and the politics, a cathartic visit back to her home village was a powerful reminder of how much can change in even a decade. \u201cWhen I went back, people who had bullied me as a child apologised,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t angry \u2013 I always knew they just needed help to understand.\u201d For the journey ahead, education and self-confidence will be the best passports to success. \u201cMy advice to young transgender people and activists around the world is remember how important self-belief is,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can\u2019t challenge discrimination without this.

Barbara Zitwer, the literary agent for the pseudonymous North Korean author Bandi\u2019s collection, The Accusation, said that she had not left her desk since accepting pre-emptive offers for the book from the US and the UK, describing international interest as \u201cimmediate and stunning\u201d. \u201cWithin a few days, I have accepted pre-empts and I expect to close in Germany, Israel, Sweden, Italy, and other territories before the London book fair [in April],\u201d said Zitwer. Bandi\u2019s stories are set in 1990s North Korea and include stories about a wife attempting to make breakfast during a famine and a factory supervisor trying avoid denouncing a friend while staying on the ruling party\u2019s good side himself. They were smuggled out of the country with the help of the Happy Reunification Road Organisation, which works to help North Koreans and for the reunification of the country. It was published in South Korea in 2014 by Chogabje. Zitwer, who has worked with major Korean authors on titles including Kyung-Sook Shin\u2019s Please Look After Mother and Han Kang\u2019s The Vegetarian, said it was \u201cunheard of until now\u201d to find a work of fiction from North Korea. \u201cI have been working with Korean literature for more than 10 years and I have never come across anything like Bandi. And what is especially incredible is that the author is living in the north and has not left,\u201d she said. \u201cThe stories depict the everyday lives of various characters living in North Korea \u2013 they are personal stories that illuminate the umbrella of horror that North Koreans live under all the time. They are the voices of mothers and sons, fathers and brothers, sisters and aunts,\u201d said Zitwer. One, she said, tells of a mother whose toddler is frightened of a huge poster of Karl Marx that he can see from their window, so she closes the blinds. A government official later comes to find out why her blinds are closed before a major parade that day, and she explains how her baby was scared of the image. \u201cWithin a few hours, however, the husband returns home and is scared to death that his wife was honest and shortly thereafter, guards come to take the mother, father and baby out of their home and they are put on a train to somewhere we can only imagine,\u201d said Zitwer. \u201cAs I read the story, I felt the mother\u2019s tender love for her baby \u2013 it is a story of a mother and her child, but pervading every molecule is the terror of the North Korean regime.  \u201cI thought the baby would be killed right there. The story was the most terrifying because the life depicted is an average day for a North Korean family. Our worst nightmares are their everyday lives. Even the unimaginable horrors are daily occurrences.\u201d Hannah Westland, of the publisher Serpent\u2019s Tail, which acquired the book for UK publication, said that The Accusation \u201cisn\u2019t just a book with a good story behind it: it\u2019s a collection of perfectly crafted novellas that, like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\u2019s work [from the old Soviet Union], speak with authority and truth-to-power directness\u201d. Their classical construction, she said, harks back to the likes of Gogol and Chekhov, while Bandi\u2019s \u201cabsurdist approach to satire\u201d is reminiscent of Ionesco\u2019s Rhinoceros, and his \u201cbiting wit \u2026 reminds you of that other great Russian literary dissident, Mikhail Bulgakov\u201d.  \u201cThe fact that Bandi has almost certainly never had access to either of the two latter writers underlines the quality of his own work,\u201d said Westland, who will publish in spring 2017. North American rights to The Accusation have been pre-empted by Grove Press, with the French translation out in March from \u00c9ditions Philippe Picquie, and rights also sold in Japan and Taiwan. Global Spanish rights have been acquired by Libros del Asteroide. Dutch rights have gone to Ambo Anthos, and there is an auction underway in Germany, said Zitwer, with further offers in from other territories. Hee-yoon Do, the president of Happy Reunification Road, said that if the author hears the news that his book will be published around the world, \u201che will not be able to keep back his tears. And he will eagerly look forward to seeing the people all around world recognise that North Korean people have been living miserably and cruelly, like slaves.\u201d Zitwer said the publication of The Accusation in the west \u201cis confirmation of the indomitable spirit of freedom of thought and imagination\u201d.  \u201cAs much and as hard as the brutal leader of North Korean tries to robotise the population, he cannot.

They went to Paris. Poetically, it was the city of love. Practically, there was a Eurostar deal on at the time. Edward and his girlfriend were in the early days of their relationship. They had met through university friends and the spark had been immediate: locked eyes across a dinner table; a shared interest in the same Netflix box sets and a mutual liking for the music of Father John Misty. When they got to Paris they spent hours walking through the streets arm in arm talking about the things that couples do when the future seems infinite and hopeful. They spoke of children\u2019s names and significant others and whether they did or didn\u2019t like Marmite (Edward did; his girlfriend didn\u2019t). And then they stumbled upon the historic Pont des Arts. In truth Edward had secretly planned for them to end up there. In his coat pocket he had a padlock purchased the week before from Robert Dyas on to which he had etched their initials on either side of a rudimentary love heart. He took the lock out and showed it to his girlfriend, explaining that he intended to fix it to the railings of the bridge. The lock would stand forever as a beautiful tribute to their lasting love. The girlfriend was touched. They kissed. Edward clipped the lock on to the metal grate, where it jostled for space with several hundred other padlocks left by several hundred other loved-up couples and then he flung the key into the waters of the Seine. \u201cIt honestly felt like one of the most romantic things I\u2019d ever done,\u201d Edward says now. \u201cIt was so symbolic.\u201d    The locks on the Pont des Arts were blamed for the collapse of the bridge\u2019s parapets    Edward doesn\u2019t want to give his real name because he\u2019s a bit embarrassed. A few months after their trip to Paris, the couple broke up. It wasn\u2019t anything particularly dramatic, he says, just a slow realisation that they weren\u2019t meant to be together after all. The lock, however, remained firmly in place. Edward spent a lot of time thinking about that lock. It began to obsess him: the notion of it being permanently affixed to a bridge in Paris, its physical presence having outlasted the human relationship it was meant to represent. \u201cI kept imagining it there, almost like it was taunting me with how naive I\u2019d been,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt seemed so stupid, looking back.\u201d Then, last June, the Parisian authorities started to cut away the locks. There were now over a million of them and the weight had been blamed for the collapse of part of the bridge\u2019s parapets. There was concern there might be further collapse. Forty-five tonnes of metal were removed \u2013 among them Edward\u2019s heartfelt purchase from Robert Dyas. In a somewhat unloving statement, the Paris health and safety officials stated: \u201cThe romantic gestures cause long-term heritage degradation and danger to visitors.\u201d As yet no one knows where the so-called \u201clove locks\u201d have been taken or what the city council intends to do with them. There are rumours of an auction or an art installation. Edward doesn\u2019t particularly care. He is just relieved the lock has been removed \u2013 and with it an uncomfortable memory of love not working out in the way he\u2019d hoped.     Lock and load: last June Paris authorities began removing the locks on the ancient Pont des Arts. Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images    Over the past decade, love locks have sprung up in cities across the world, emblazoned with lovers\u2019 initials, declarations of undying affection and sometimes even marriage proposals (one lock left on Brooklyn Bridge stated simply: \u201cCarrina, will you marry me?\u201d written in marker pen). In Canada they have appeared along the Wild Pacific Trail on Vancouver Island. In Australia they have been left on a fence overlooking Lake Hume in New South Wales. In Las Vegas they are left on the half-scale model of the Eiffel Tower at the Paris Hotel. In Taiwan they are hung in pairs on an overpass at the Fengyuan railway station in the belief that the magnetic fields generated by moving trains will imbue them with positive energy and make wishes come true. And at Gretna Green in Scotland, scene of runaway marriages through the ages, specially designed lightweight padlocks are available at \u00a319.99. The gold- coloured lock can even be personalised with laser engraving. \u201cThere\u2019s no key,\u201d the Gretna Green website states in its product description. \u201cThese unique love locks lock one time only, meaning that once your love is locked, it is sealed for ever.\u201d Sealed, at least, until rust corrosion takes its natural course or the structure in question starts to collapse under the weight of the metal. It is not just Paris that feels the need to protect its heritage from such romantic impulsiveness. Some 5,000 locks left on the Ponte Vecchio in Florence were removed by city authorities because they were deemed to be ugly as well as denting the metal structure of the bridge. The same thing happened with Dublin\u2019s Ha\u2019penny Bridge in 2012. In New York a group of \u201clock pick\u201d enthusiasts organised an expedition to remove the locks on Brooklyn Bridge in 2013 and save them for a piece of public artwork before the authorities removed them \u2013 a week later, new locks had already sprung up in their place. Love locks are divisive. Jonathan Jones, the Guardian art critic, has written that the practice is \u201cas stupid as climbing a mountain and leaving a crisp packet at the top, or seeking out the most unspoilt beach and stubbing out cigarettes in the sand. Seriously. This is not a romantic thing to do. It is a wanton and arrogant act of destruction. It is littering. It is an attack on the very beauty that people supposedly travel to Paris or Rome to see.\u201d    Who doesn\u2019t engage in magical thinking to ward off the terrifying spectres of separation and loss?    So where does our need to lock our initials on to a chunk of historic metal come from? According to some, it stems from an ancient Chinese tradition. Others believe it started in the Serbian town of Vrnjacka Banja during the First World War, when a local schoolteacher was left heartbroken after her army officer beau was sent away to fight in Greece and fell in love with a woman in Corfu. The story slipped into folklore and couples began leaving padlocks on the bridge where the teacher and the army officer used to meet. Then in 2006 Italian author Federico Moccia wrote a cult novel entitled I Need You about lovers fixing locks to a lamppost on a bridge in Rome \u2013 the idea was picked up by teenagers, then tourists and then, it seems, by the rest of the world. Moccia insisted in an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that he did not regret his part in the phenomenon: \u201cThe padlocks are a symbol of love and something to be proud of. Tourists go to Ponte Milvio to see them, and I\u2019m proud of that. In any case, better a padlock than graffiti disfiguring the walls.\u201d And as Edward discovered, there is a natural human impulse to give permanent shape to a mutable human emotion, as if by lending it a physical presence we can mitigate against love\u2019s fragility. Are we seeking to protect ourselves against loneliness by leaving our mark both on a city and on someone else\u2019s heart? The author Olivia Laing, whose forthcoming book The Lonely City is a cultural history of loneliness, says that although love locks are \u201cexceptionally irritating, I understand the sentiment. Love is such a vulnerable state: who doesn\u2019t engage in magical thinking to ward off the terrifying spectres of separation and loss?\u201d And in some ways leaving a padlock on a bridge is no different from carving one\u2019s initials in a tree: in a transient world there is the same impetus towards ownership (\u201cI woz here\u201d) and preservation (\u201cI will be remembered\u201d). \u201cIt\u2019s the triumph of hope over experience,\u201d explains Ivan Ward, deputy director of the Freud Museum in London. \u201cPeople like to express their love or make declarations of love, and locking a padlock and throwing away the key seems to be a straightforward symbol of fidelity and commitment. Forsaking all others. We want to be the \u2018only one\u2019 with the sexual partner as we wanted to be with the mother, and how much more certain can we be if we actually \u2013 ie symbolically \u2013 lock someone in? I suppose it is potentially less embarrassing than getting the name of your beloved tattooed across your bottom.\u201d     Key to my heart: while the locks are being removed from some tourist attractions, other authorities are raising funds by creating special padlocks for lovers. Photograph: Allan Swart/Alamy    True. And there is some base, primal appeal in the idea of being locked on to someone else in the midst of life\u2019s uncertainty. In Padua, Italy, there is a historic custom of presenting St Valentine\u2019s keys as romantic gestures each year in order to \u201cunlock the giver\u2019s heart\u201d. The notion of leaving a lock on a bridge emphasises that element of danger: the risk of falling into a void unless one is anchored to something stable and lasting. \u201cLove can save us from that,\u201d says Ward. \u201cI presume that when couples do their love-lock ritual they feel really happy, but Freud, always the pessimist, usually finds some kind of anxiety lurking beneath the surface. And separation anxiety is one of the big ones.\u201d Now, as if to compound our separation anxiety, we\u2019re even being separated from the idea of love locks themselves. Some cities, anxious about their environmental impact, have banned them altogether. After the Rialto Bridge was covered in padlocks fixed to the iron brackets and bars which helped keep the 16th-century structure together, the city of Venice removed them and introduced a \u20ac3,000 fine for anyone with the temerity to add a new one. A campaign called Unlock Your Love produced leaflets stating: \u201cYour love doesn\u2019t need chains. Venice doesn\u2019t need your garbage.\u201d In Chicago the authorities have been systematically cutting off padlocks to stop them falling off and hurting people when the city\u2019s moveable bridges are lifted for boat traffic, while in Berlin leaving a love lock is now punishable by a fine after rust damage was noted on two of its bridges. Yet the craze looks set to continue. Edinburgh\u2019s Forth Road Bridge raised more than \u00a310,000 in 2014 for the local lifeboat service after dedicating four panels for passersby who wanted to buy and fix their padlocks to the bridge. Moscow has introduced metal trees where couples can leave their locks. And these days you can even purchase a \u201cvirtual\u201d love lock to express your feelings of intimacy and affection online. It all comes too late for Edward, however. This Valentine\u2019s Day he\u2019s not planning any grand romantic gestures. He\u2019s bought his girlfriend a card.

It is also twice the size that Prof Tim Flannery, in a paper arguing for a much, much smaller Australia, set as the upper limit of the country\u2019s long-term carrying capacity. That figure, between 8 million and 12 million, was passed in 1968.

And, as Danish artist Einar Wegener, who becomes Lili Elbe, Eddie Redmayne resurrects a pioneering transgender journey. Released over the past year, these four films \u2013 Carol, Freeheld, Holding the Man and The Danish Girl \u2013 have done an excellent job of elucidating sexuality and gender experiences that exist outside the \u201cnorm\u201d. What\u2019s more, Blanchett, Mara and Redmayne are all up for Oscars: what validation for queers like me. We exist! These four films connect with broad audiences because they are compassionately layered with complex but universal human truths: desire, the need for love, a fear of rejection.    Related: Baftas 2016: How the British academy stole a march on the \u2018so straight\u2019 Oscars    But all four of those stories are propelled by the struggle for the expression of the characters\u2019 sexual or gender identity and their relationships that exist against repression. These stories, in essence, are all about the fight for the right to exist. That\u2019s an important story to tell but, in the broader sense of cinema, it\u2019s limiting. There\u2019s so much more that needs to be explored in queer film, to provide a full kaleidoscope of our lives. The mainstream success of these four films represents a huge step for our stories, but alone they\u2019re not enough.  The 23rd Mardi Gras film festival opens in Sydney this week and, like other celebrations of queer cinema around the world, it will do a much better job of reflecting queer lives as they are actually experienced today. Stories abound here about gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people whose internal and external battles have already been established and, when these people are still exploring their sexuality, there\u2019s often a narrative drive that\u2019s broader and more complex than a simple response to the mainstream climate. There\u2019s another shortcoming with the range of queer stories that have dominated awards season this year: Carol, Freeheld, Holding the Man and The Danish Girl all have white-skinned characters \u2013 just like much of the film industry here and abroad. While the Mardi Gras film festival\u2019s offerings are also predominantly white, there are many significant exceptions.  Of the more than a dozen of this year\u2019s Mardi Gras films I have previewed, my favourite is the Thai film How to Win at Checkers (Every Time), written and directed by the Korean-American Josh Kim. In the film, an 11-year-old boy, Oat (Ingkarat Damrongsakkul), tries to save his 21-year-old gay brother Ek (Thira Chutikul) from being drafted in a corrupt lottery in the town square.            Ek\u2019s sexuality is accepted by his family; this is more a story about economic disparity \u2013 Ek\u2019s more affluent boyfriend, Jai, can bribe his way out of the draft \u2013 and the ties of blood and friendship, mixed with the seamier side of the Thai bar, drug and prostitution scene. As Hollywood protests that it cannot find transgender actors to play transgender roles, transgender actress Natarat Lakha is a scene-stealer as Kitty \u2013 two years into taking hormone pills, she proudly shows off her bulging groin in a one-piece bathing suit. There are two terrific Mexican films in the festival with transgender characters, too. Lonely Stars, a comedy directed by Fernando Urdapilleta, stars Dana Karvelas as Valentina and Jorge Arriaga as Joana, nightclub workers whose boss controls them through fear of violence. Karvelas, also known as androgynous performance artist Ysak Mantu, describes herself as a \u201cfine, classy travesty\u201d and \u201csomething apart, underground \u2026 between the sexes\u201d.            Meanwhile, Carmin Tropical is fascinating noir directed by Rigoberto Perezcano, starring Jose Pecina as Mabel, a transgender nightclub singer. She identifies her gender as \u201cmuxe\u201d, a local word for a third sex, who is trying to solve the murder of a fellow muxe, Juchitan.   Related: Ellen Page: \u2018Being out became more important than any movie\u2019    I also enjoyed Naz &amp; Maalik, the story of two African-American Muslim teenage lovers who spend their days hawking lottery tickets, snacks, perfumes and Catholic saint cards in Brooklyn. Yes, the film was written and directed by a white guy (Jay Dockendorf), and the pair are stuck in that old trope of trying to keep their sexuality secret from their families, but the narrative drive here is Islamophobia: the FBI is following them. This year\u2019s Australian showcase film at the festival is Downriver, directed by Grant Scicluna. In Downriver, which made its debut at the Melbourne international film festival, Reef Ireland plays a young man released from jail after serving his sentence for his part in the drowning of a child. While most of the characters are same-sex attracted, and there\u2019s quite a bit of male-on-male sex, sexuality is almost beside the point: here is a story of guilt and redemption that asks what culpability a child has for killing another.  (One wonders what mainstream cinema opportunities Downriver will have, though; Jonnie Leahy\u2019s life-affirming Skin Deep was shown at last year\u2019s festival to acclaim and has a few non-festival screenings this year, but never received a general release. An \u201coligopoly\u201d of Hollywood studios and distribution arms tie up Australian cinema screens, overwhelmingly programming heteronormative films and TV shows that still take straight, cisgender status as a given.)            In Colombian film The Firefly, directed by Ana Maria Hermida, a woman finds herself drawn to her late brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e \u2013 it\u2019s as much a study of grief as latent same-sex attraction. Another highlight is Remembering the Man, which dovetails archival footage and sound recordings of the Holding The Man playwright Tim Conigrave, along with his friends\u2019 recollections of Conigrave\u2019s relationship with long-term partner John Caleo. The documentary had a difficult gestation, including rejection for airtime by ABC \u2013 in light of the success of the play\u2019s film adaptation, this was a bad call.            From Switzerland, What\u2019s Between Us has a great performance by Ursina Ladi, whose husband leaves her for another man; from Sweden, Alexandra-Therese Keining\u2019s Girls Lost features three outcast girls who swallow a potion and are given cisgender bodies and find they are treated differently. Taiwan, Israel, Japan, Germany, Canada, France, Argentina, the UK and the Netherlands are all represented on the program, which features a bunch from the US too. Perhaps you should consider getting along to the festival, and seeing human sexuality in a rainbow of permutations, before blindingly white Oscar night.

Her case exposed the dark truth about Philippine culture that is macho, patriarchal, misogynistic and inherently violent. To eradicate violence, we need to collaborate with other social justice movements because ultimately what we want to change is the culture in my country. That is a gargantuan task.

These businesses in Vietnam have taken actions in their companies to raise awareness of LGBT issues and try to create a safe and inclusive environment for everyone.

More than just facts, figures, statistics and moral or ethical debates, we are brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, neighbours and co-workers.

Omar Sharif Jr, actor/ambassador, Human Rights Foundation, New York, US, @omarsharifjr 10 | Take discrimination cases to the courts  If LGBTI people live in countries that have constitutional rights that guarantee equal rights, then use the courts to challenge discriminatory laws and policies. Winning each case makes the next one easier, gives the media the opportunity to report the issue and the public to debate. It also gives inspiration to people who are afraid to express their orientation or gender.

Despite fears of military escalation, he made clear that the US would continue to make its presence felt in the region. \u201cWe have maintained that this is something that should be resolved peacefully among the claimants,\u201d Earnest told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cAt the same time, the United States military has undertaken operations to indicate our view, and make clear in pretty stark terms our view, that we intend to continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere that international law allows.\u201d A patrol by a US navy destroyer came within 12 nautical miles of Triton Island in the Paracels last month, earning Chinese condemnation. America has also conducted sea and air patrols near artificial islands built by China in the Spratly islands chain, including by two B-52 strategic bombers in November.  Earnest welcomed this week\u2019s Association of Southeastern Asian Nations (Asean) summit hosted by Obama in California, where members signed an agreement to work for peace and stability and avoid militarisation of the sea. They had made a \u201cdirect commitment\u201d, he said, to clarify territorial maritime claims in accordance with international law and peacefully resolve disputes. The US does not assert ownership of any territories in the South China Sea but has warned that Chinese aggression could impair global trade. Earnest added: \u201cThe US interest is not in particular claims on any of the land features but rather in the continued free flow of commerce in this region of the world. That has significant consequences for the global economy and significant consequences for the US economy.\u201d Asked if China\u2019s actions flew in the face of such an agreement, the press secretary noted that China had not signed it. \u201cI think this is an indication, though, that the 10 or so countries in southeast Asia who also have claims in that region of the world are committed to the approach that we have advocated, which is the peaceful resolution of these disputes in a way that doesn\u2019t ramp up the military presence or military capabilities that are located in these disputed territories.\u201d China claims most of the South China Sea, through which more than $5tn in global trade passes every year, and has been building runways and other infrastructure on artificial islands to strengthen its claims. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Taiwan have rival claims.  Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry has said the missile batteries were set up on Woody Island in the Paracels chain, which has been under Chinese control for decades but is also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam.  Earlier on Wednesday, John Kerry, the US secretary of state, called for a diplomatic resolution. \u201cThere is every evidence every day that there has been an increase of militarisation of one kind or another,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s of serious concern. We\u2019ve had these conversations with the Chinese, and I\u2019m confident that over the next days we will have further, very serious conversation on this.\u201d The Chinese Defense Ministry told Reuters that the latest reports about missile deployment were nothing but \u201chype\u201d. Foreign minister Wang Yi told reporters the \u201climited and necessary self-defence facilities\u201d China had on islands and reefs where it has personnel stationed was \u201cconsistent with the right to self-protection that China is entitled to under international law\u201d."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/18/beijing-accuses-us-of-ulterior-motives-in-hyping-up-south-china-sea-missile-move", "publicationDate": "2016-02-18T05:39:37Z", "tags": ["South China Sea", "Asia Pacific", "UK news", "World news", "China", "US news"], "sentences": ["The development was confirmed by the defence ministry in Taiwan, which also claims sovereignty.", "Photograph: AP    In the Paracels chain, Woody Island has been under Chinese control since the 1970s but is also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam."], "title": "Beijing accuses US of 'ulterior motives in hyping up' South China Sea missile move", "article": "China has hit back at the US and its allies in Asia following revelations that Beijing had deployed surface-to-air missile launchers on a disputed island in the South China Sea.

Asked by the Guardian to comment on the missile launchers, Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Najib Razak, said: \u201cWe urge all parties to exercise restraint and avoid any activities that may increase tensions in the South China Sea.\u201d The move has also frustrated Washington and US Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday that there \u201cis every evidence, every day that there has been an increase of militarisation of one kind or another.\u201d \u201cWe have had these conversations with the Chinese and I am confident that over the next days we will have further very serious conversation on this,\u201d he added.

The South China Sea issue and concerns over China\u2019s military expansion has become a key point during the 2016 US presidential campaign. Republican candidate Marco Rubio, asked by the Guardian how the US should respond, said the navy should add 25 ships to its current standing \u201cso that we have a permanent carrier presence in the region to challenge both any air defence zones that they claim and any water rights that they claim that are illegitimate.\u201d \u201cWe cannot live in a world where the Chinese government illegitimately claims that they own and can control the flow of commerce through the most important shipping lane in the world,\u201d he later added. The missile launchers are believed to be HQ-9 air defence systems, which have a range of about 200km (125 miles). A patrol by a US navy destroyer came within 12 nautical miles of Triton Island in the Paracels in January, earning Chinese condemnation.

A lot of bad things are coalescing all over the place and no one seems to be in charge. A combination of opportunist ambition, of myriad weaknesses, systemic and personal, and of profound global power shifts put us all in danger.  We have been here before. You must have read with alarm, or watched flickering black and white newsreels, how imperial Europe, rich and complacent, drifted towards fatal civil war in 1914. Schoolchildren are taught how 25 years later it all happened again, this time after self-deluding efforts to duck unpleasant realities ended in Hitler\u2019s war.  \u201cHow could they be so blind?\u201d we wonder as we read the latest history book or watch those TV documentaries. Yet look at us. Our own elected national leader, David Cameron, is currently using most of his own energy, and a lot of his EU neighbours\u2019 time, to renegotiate Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe.  There\u2019s a case for that, of course. Europe could do with a shakeup. But context matters. Everyone knows that Cameron\u2019s primary motive is parochial calculation of domestic party management on a battleground of his own devising.  When not trying to cut a deal that will satisfy all 28 member states (they have elections too), those EU leaders grapple ineffectually with more pressing existential problems \u2013 the eurozone crisis and the refugee crisis to name but two. Compared with 20, or even 10 years ago, the EU is short of substantial leadership.  Angela Merkel, sheet anchor of both Germany and Europe, looked so strong a year ago and now looks vulnerable to her own self-inflicted error, that open door to 1 million non-European migrants. New Labour\u2019s equivalent miscalculation in 2004 were mostly Poles. The unsettling effect has been much the same. In AfD and Pegida Germany now has its Ukip and its French Front National.  Since those terrible wars of 1914-18 and 1939-45 Europe has grown accustomed to being babysat by the Americans, linchpins of Nato, which protects the otherwise rich-but-vulnerable EU. Don\u2019t bank on it for much longer.  Obama thinks his foreign policy legacy will be to have ended America\u2019s string of ill-judged foreign interventions and brought a non-nuclear Iran in from the cold. He \u201ctilts towards Asia\u201d (pdf) on whose economic axis the world increasingly turns. Europe, old and lazy, doesn\u2019t even pay its Nato subs.  Obama may be wrong about all that. When British MPs voted against military action in Syria in August 2013 they gave the White House cover for doing the same. It may be Ed Miliband\u2019s only contribution to the course of world history. Since the Assad regime had crossed Obama\u2019s declared red line by using chemical weapons against the voters, Moscow saw that Washington could be faced down. Obama is a sermoniser, averse to projecting US power to keep the peace. Russia (like Austro-Hungary in 1914) is an aggrieved former superpower seeking to assert itself.    Steadier oil prices might add some welcome stability to the global commodity markets where the slowdown in China\u2019s economy (how slow? No one can trust official figures) has undermined emerging economies, FTSE corporations and the banks where so much of our money is parked. Fingers crossed against a second Great Recession, which we would enter in far worse shape. No room here to mention China\u2019s own economic woes. Its central bank governor has just broken his silence: \u201cI\u2019m not God or a magician.\u201d Nor are his counterparts elsewhere. No space either to discuss how serious are those new Chinese missiles being deployed (shades of Cuba 1962?) on one of the fragile reefs it claims in the South China Sea. Could that be the Sarajevo spark to ignite something bigger that ruins us all? Japan and other neighbours are unhappy about China\u2019s claim (known as the nine-dash line) which straddles key shipping lanes and which is out to arbitration in The Hague. China is a rising power, the US a faltering one, Russia revanchist, Europe in retirement. In Shinzo Abe Japan has a nationalist leader. Taiwan has just elected a more assertive president in Tsai Ing-wen. Is this good or bad for peace? Where is America, which has dominated the eastern oceans since the fightback from Pearl Harbor (1941)? Good question, but not a reassuring one. Cautious Obama may not be an internationalist in the mould of presidents from FDR to Bill Clinton via General Eisenhower, architect of D-Day. But he\u2019s much more so than what may come next. In their very different ways Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders both represent the latest revival of the isolationist strand in American public life. Either just might be president. I know, it probably won\u2019t happen. None of this litany of potential woes and flashpoints may come to pass. Hillary Clinton may beat Senator Marco Rubio or vice versa. Michael Bloomberg may step in and save the republic for the techies. Europe may survive intact and recover to better times. Syrian refugees may be able to go home. Rightwing populism might not spread through Europe. But don\u2019t bank on it and do carry an umbrella. The weather may be about to change.

If an arbitration or an agreement was reached that these islands were recognised, then those 12-mile limits would come into play and we would not be engaged in going through them. But at the moment, they are not recognised as anyone\u2019s territory and we can sail legally, peacefully through these alleged 12-mile limits.\u201d Conroy said while it would be \u201cfoolhardy\u201d for the government to announce a freedom-of-navigation exercise in advance of it happening, Australia \u201cshould be prepared to defend the international system\u201d.

Addressing reporters after the bilateral meeting, Turnbull said he and Key were \u201cabsolutely of the same mind\u201d on regional security issues. The Australian prime minister said the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has previously acknowledged the need to avoid falling into \u201cthe Thucydides Trap, which is ... essentially where a rising power creates anxiety among other powers such that conflict occurs\u201d. \u201cPresident Xi is right in identifying avoiding that trap as a key goal,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cOur proposition, very simply, we take no sides on whose claims, Australia and New Zealand have no claims in the South China Sea, we can confidently assure you of that. But the fact is that there is a massive vested interest in reducing tensions and not doing things, any measures that would inflame tensions.\u201d Key said both countries had been pursuing deeper economic ties with China, which could increase their opportunities to make their case diplomatically. \u201cAustralia and New Zealand now have free trade agreements with China, we are both part of the Asian [Infrastructure] Investment Bank \u2013 we have regular contact and dialogue,\u201d Key said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s lost on any of the parties that are, in a disputed position in the South China Sea that any blow-up of activities there would be very bad for security and both economic issues in the region, so we just have to continue to, I think, to make the case that the parties have to look to resolve that amicably and lawfully.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/21/south-china-sea-julie-bishop-says-missile-launchers-shouldnt-deter-planes", "publicationDate": "2016-02-21T00:26:20Z", "tags": ["South China Sea", "Australia news", "Julie Bishop", "China", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "Coalition", "Labor party"], "sentences": ["Tensions rose last week after Beijing appeared to install batteries of eight missile launchers and a radar system on Woody Island, which is part of the Paracel Island chain and is claimed by China, Taiwan and Vietnam.", "Images of the equipment were taken by the private company ImageSat International and the development was subsequently confirmed by the Taiwanese defence ministry."], "title": "South China Sea: Julie Bishop says missile launchers shouldn't deter flights", "article": "Commercial planes should continue flying over the South China Sea despite the risk of \u201cmiscalculation\u201d from the apparent placement of surface-to-air missile launchers in the disputed region, Julie Bishop has said.

It\u00a0is supported in this by most of the other large technology companies, among them Google and Microsoft. This refusal is at first sight completely baffling, even by the standards of Silicon Valley technolibertarianism. This newspaper is opposed to bulk surveillance, and to the operation of intelligence agencies outside the law, but no surveillance could be more tightly targeted than what the FBI is asking for here and the agency has been granted a court order in complete openness. There are very significant differences between what is happening here and the workings of secretive courts which judge requests for surveillance without any real public oversight. It is of course true that security services and still more their nervous political masters will always demand maximal powers and exploit those they have right up to the edge of the law and sometimes over it. But so will large transnational corporations. There\u2019s no reason to regard one as automatically morally superior to the other. Both must be controlled through democratically ratified laws and courts. Apple claims that the order amounts to a demand to weaken the secrecy of all iPhones and thus \u201cthreaten the security of our customers\u201d. The demand to examine this one phone, however reasonable in itself, is seen as the thin end of a very thick legal wedge. If\u00a0the FBI can compel Apple in this case, what is to stop it in other cases? And if the US security services can make Apple defeat its own security measures, what is to stop other governments having a go? China, along with Hong Kong and Taiwan, already accounts for a quarter of Apple\u2019s revenues. No one expects the Chinese government to show any respect for anyone\u2019s privacy. Surely Apple is right to stand up to all government bullying, wherever it comes from? This argument is plausible until you get into the technical details, which point against any automatic slide from this one case towards compromised privacy for all. The secrets on Mr\u00a0Farook\u2019s phone are guarded partly by the immutable mathematics of cryptography and partly by deliberate human decisions, although this is a distinction easily and sometimes deliberately blurred. The phone has been built so that it is impossible simply to guess a password by trying millions of them thousands of times a second: if the attempt is made, it will simply scramble its contents in a way mathematically impossible to unscramble. Now Apple could write the software that would allow the FBI\u2019s computers to crack a short, weak password quickly, though if Mr\u00a0Farook used a sufficiently long and strong one the phone will be impossible to crack even with Apple\u2019s full cooperation. The FBI can\u2019t write this software, and nor could any other government, since the phone will only accept firmware signed with Apple\u2019s own cryptographic keys. If those were ever copied and stolen, no piece of Apple equipment in the world would be safe again. But so long as only Apple holds them, and the FBI is not asking to share them, nothing could be cracked without its help. Questions of confidentiality and secrecy are not new. Lawyers with their clients, and even priests in the confessional, both have duties that may conflict with their duties to society and sometimes \u2013 very rarely \u2013 the duty to society should take precedence. This\u00a0is one such case. Confidentiality is never completely absolute even for multinational technology companies. Their products may be indistinguishable from magic but we mustn\u2019t let their glamour blind us to the principles involved."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/23/beijing-says-us-defence-of-hawaii-no-different-to-its-deployments-in-south-china-sea", "publicationDate": "2016-02-23T05:47:14Z", "tags": ["South China Sea", "World news", "US news", "Hawaii", "Asia Pacific", "China"], "sentences": ["Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Taiwan have rival claims."], "title": "Beijing defends deployments in South China Sea as no different to US defence of Hawaii", "article": "China\u2019s South China Sea military deployments are no different from US deployments on Hawaii, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has said, striking a combative tone ahead of a visit by Foreign Minister Wang Yi to the United States this week.  The US last week accused China of raising tensions in the South China Sea by its apparent deployment of surface-to-air missiles on a disputed island, a move China has neither confirmed nor denied. Asked whether the South China Sea, and the missiles, would come up when Wang is in the United States to meet Secretary of State John Kerry, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Washington should not use the issue of military facilities on the islands as a \u201cpretext to make a fuss\u201d.  \u201cThe US is not involved in the South China Sea dispute, and this is not and should not become a problem between China and the United States,\u201d Hua told a daily news briefing.           What\u2019s happening in the South China Sea?      US State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States would \u201cpress China to deescalate and stop its militarisation\u201d in the South China Sea.  Toner said China\u2019s \u201cmilitarisation activity\u201d only escalated tensions, and added: \u201cThere needs to be a diplomatic mechanism in place that allows these territorial claims to be settled in a peaceful way.\u201d  Wang is due to meet Kerry on Tuesday. Their talks will also include the international response to North Korea\u2019s recent nuclear test and rocket launch, cyber security and climate change, Toner told a regular news briefing.  China hopes the US abides by its promises not to take sides in the dispute and stop \u201chyping up\u201d the issue and tensions, especially over China\u2019s \u201climited\u201d military positions there, she said.  \u201cChina\u2019s deploying necessary, limited defensive facilities on its own territory is not substantively different from the United States defending Hawaii,\u201d Hua added.  US ships and aircraft carrying out frequent, close-in patrols and surveillance in recent years is what has increased regional tensions, she said.  \u201cIt\u2019s this that is the biggest cause of the militarisation of the South China Sea. We hope that the United States does not confuse right and wrong on this issue or practice double standards.\u201d On Monday a US think-tank said China had added to its build-up by installing what looked like a high-frequency radar system in the Spratly Islands. The Asian Maritime Transparency Initiative at Washington\u2019s Centre for Strategic and International Studies said the images showed construction of facilities at Cuarteron reef appeared nearly complete and the artificial island covered an area of about 20 hectares (50 acres). \u201cTwo probable radar towers have been built on the northern portion of the feature, and a number of 65ft (20-metre) poles have been erected across a large section of the southern portion,\u201d the report said. \u201cThese poles could be a high-frequency radar installation, which would significantly bolster China\u2019s ability to monitor surface and air traffic across the southern portion of the South China Sea.\u201d China\u2019s foreign and defence ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The report, which based its analysis on satellite images from January and February, said China already had significant radar coverage of the northern part of the South China Sea given its mainland installations and in the Paracel Islands to the north-west of the Spratlys.  On Monday a senior US naval officer was reported as saying Australia and other countries should follow the US lead and conduct \u201cfreedom-of-navigation\u201d naval operations within 12 nautical miles (18 km) of contested islands in the South China Sea.  China claims most of the South China Sea, through which more than $5tn in global trade passes every year. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Taiwan have rival claims.  Beijing has rattled nerves with construction and reclamation activities on the islands it occupies, though it says these moves are mostly for civilian purposes.  The state-owned China Southern Power Grid Company will set up a power grid management station in what China calls Sansha City, located on Woody Island in the Paracels, which will be able to access microgrids in 16 other islands, according to China\u2019s top regulator of state-owned assets.  In the long term, the station will be able to remotely manage power for many islands there, the statement added, without specifying which islands it was referring to.

The process has been successfully trialled at a pilot plant in China and a much bigger facility is now planned. Energy-dense liquids are vital to transport but are currently derived from oil, a fossil fuel, and transport produces about a quarter of the global carbon emissions driving climate change. Biofuels have been seen as possible replacement, but current biofuels compete with food production and have been blamed for driving up food prices. Using waste gases to create low-carbon liquid fuels would be a major advance in the battle against global warming if they could be made at low cost and large scale. Another company expects to be using different microbes to produce fuel from steel plants in Belgium and China in 2017. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) process uses bacteria to convert the waste gases into acetic acid - vinegar - then an engineered yeast to produce an oil. \u201cIt is quite an extraordinary story,\u201d said Prof Gregory Stephanopoulos, an expert in chemical engineering and biotechnology at MIT in the US. \u201cIt started just four to five years ago with a post-doctoral project funded by the US Energy Department. We are looking at a very fast timescale [of development],\u201d, he said. \u201cWe have pieced the system together into an integrated system, where you put gas in one end and get a liquid fuel out of the other end.\u201d The research was published on Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The patents for the process are owned by MIT and have been licensed to GTL Biofuel Inc. Its pilot plant outside Shanghai ran successfully from September 2015 and a larger \u201csemi-commercial\u2019 demonstration plant, 20 times the size, is set to begin construction. This will test if the process can be scaled up and evaluate its costs and carbon footprint, said Prof Stephanopoulos: \u201cIt is one thing to do it on a scale of 1-2 litres in the lab, but a different story to move up 1,000 litres and then 20,000 litres in the demonstration plant.\u201d \u201cThe bottom line, if one is aiming at making fuels from renewable resources, is we need to look very carefully at low-cost feed stocks,\u201d he said. Garbage, along with manure and farm waste, is a particularly promising source of the \u201csyngas\u201d required, he said: \u201cThe volumes are staggering.\u201d Furthermore, using the gas from municipal waste reduces the carbon footprint of the liquid fuel, compared to exhaust gases from fossil fuel plants.  Prof Stephanopoulos said there are already thousands of biogas sites across Europe, but he argues the current practice of burning this gas to produce electricity is wasteful: \u201cIt is very costly and can only survive due to subsidies.\u201d Better, he said, is to use the gas to produce fuels that can replace gasoline or diesel. The MIT team are not the only people developing biotechnologies to turn exhaust gases into fuels. Like MIT, the US company Lanzatech uses microbes that can ferment gases into more complex molecules, a skill originally evolved so the bacteria could thrive at bubbling, hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. Lanzatech\u2019s processes aim to produce either fuel or chemicals useful in industry. The company is currently building commercial units in Belgium with ArcelorMittal, the world\u2019s largest steelmaker; in China with Capital Steel and in Taiwan with China Steel, with the first unit expected to enter service in 2017. Another US company, Catalysta, is working on converting methane into hydrocarbon fuels."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/09/a-brighter-summer-day-chinese-film-edward-yang-review", "publicationDate": "2016-03-09T11:00:19Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "sentences": ["If you see a single four-hour film about the transitional generation of Chinese refugees born in Taiwan after the Communist takeover, make it Edward Yang\u2019s A Brighter Summer Day.", "To frame this as the Taiwanese Rebel Without a Cause is hardly a stretch."], "title": "A Brighter Summer Day review \u2013 teenage kicks from an arthouse master", "article": "If you see a single four-hour film about the transitional generation of Chinese refugees born in Taiwan after the Communist takeover, make it Edward Yang\u2019s A Brighter Summer Day. Though since its debut on the film festival scene in 1991 it\u2019s been a difficult title to find, at least in the United States. That ends now, however, with the four-day run at Brooklyn\u2019s BAMcin\u00e9matek of a new 4K restoration followed by a highly anticipated Blu-ray and DVD release via the Criterion Collection. It has never had a general American release. \nEdward Yang is best known for his rich 2000 multigenerational melodrama Yi Yi: a One and a Two, and one can find some similarities between it and this earlier, massive film. While lengthy, the picture moves at a remarkable rate, unspooling a plot that involves a broad cast of characters, many of whom have their own evolving storylines. Despite the four hours, there will be no intermission at BAM; it\u2019s how Yang, who died in 2007, wanted it, and today\u2019s binge-watching audiences ought to take to it nicely.  \nWhile much of A Brighter Summer Day deals with heady themes of identity, loss and longing, the bulk of the story sprints among teenage gangs at a less-than-reputable \u201cnight school\u201d. (They call it night school, but the students attend during the day and still live at home, so I either missed a key line of dialogue or something didn\u2019t translate right.) A true violent event from Yang\u2019s childhood inspired elements of the plot; the heartache and confusion every teenager experiences filled in the rest. \n \n  \n \nAt the center of A Brighter Summer Day is S\u2019ir (Chang Chen), a kid from a good home finding himself increasingly mixed up with the wrong crowd. To frame this as the Taiwanese Rebel Without a Cause is hardly a stretch. The year is 1960, and the families that fled Mao Zedong in 1949 are now past the point of pretending that they are ever headed back to the mainland. The \u201cunknown little island\u201d, as a character refers to their home, is doing the double duty of absorbing the new population and finding its feet as a political hot potato. Tanks occasionally roll down docile neighborhood streets with little discussion about where they are coming from or where they are headed. The local people play Japanese music, to the consternation of their neighbors from the mainland, though the kids, just by anti-communist inertia, become increasingly obsessed with rock\u2019n\u2019roll. \nYang\u2019s graceful, naturalistic way of inserting politically fraught signifiers into his characters\u2019 hands could teach other film-makers a thing or two. That a violent teen chooses that most American of sporting gear, a baseball bat, to beat the snot out of someone surely means something in this context, but Yang isn\u2019t going to bash you over the head with it. \n \n  Related: Edward Yang: Take Two  \n \nNext door to the school is a film studio shooting a Chinese costume drama. S\u2019ir and his buddy Cat (who seems at first like a Milo Minderbinder-esque scoundrel, but actually has an artistic soul) slink around the place, yanking the occasional prop. S\u2019ir walks there one day with Ming (Lisa Yang) who is offered a screen test on the spot: the director is interested in what\u2019s new. \nCat\u2019s prepubescent singing voice has a feminine quality, and he is the featured vocalist at the many ice cream shop and school auditorium concerts. With the help of S\u2019ir\u2019s older sister, he transcribes the English lyrics of early American rock n\u2019 roll songs, memorizing them phonetically. The resulting sound is like an Asian Little Anthony and the Imperials and it is mesmerizing. (The title comes from a line in Elvis Presley\u2019s song Are You Lonesome Tonight?)  \nThese innocent-seeming shows, and on whose turf they appear, are part of the escalating gang troubles that, along with keeping company with Ming, begin to cause trouble for S\u2019ir. Add to this the fact his father, who had heretofore been pulling strings with officials to get S\u2019ir back in the better school, is now under suspicion of still being in contact with mainland China. \nThe term \u201cShakespearean\u201d is too frequently cited to describe anything with a vast set of players, but it is a strong fit here. The tragedy that comes feels inevitable, almost necessary for this new community to suffer and learn from. While there are many moments of levity, they emerge realistically from the characters, often presented in a deadpan style. The film maintains an emphasis on medium and wide-angle shots, the characters moving through and about the school courtyards and neighborhoods, the space given emphasis over inserts and closeups. What makes this such a striking film is how the larger scope works perfectly in tandem with the very specific time and setting. The 25-year wait since its initial production makes its first day of official availability in the US all the brighter."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/10/watch-fonejacker-star-kayvan-novak-in-a-paddy-power-advert-ad-break", "publicationDate": "2016-03-10T12:32:04Z", "tags": ["Advertising", "Media", "Android", "Google", "Mobile phones", "Technology", "UK news"], "sentences": ["Add to this a distinctive electronic music bed and you have a film that perfectly expresses the idea of a smooth service.Agency: DDB Stockholm Director: The Perlorian Brothers McDonald\u2019s McCaf\u00e9: \u2018Coming Out\u2019 (starts at 03:55) - Taiwan This sweet Taiwanese advert featuring a young man coming out as gay to his father has provoked quite a controversy on the Asian island where some have perceived it as a Western multinational encouraging homosexuality.", "The catchily named Alliance of Taiwan Religious Groups for the Protection of Family are so incensed that it is leading calls for a boycott of the fast-food chain.Agency: Leo Burnett Taiwan Director: Ya-Chuan Hsiao  Jason Stone is the editor of David Reviews "], "title": "Watch Fonejacker star Kayvan Novak in a Paddy Power advert - Ad break", "article": "Android: \u2018Rock, Paper, Scissors\u2019 (starts at 00:04) - US The game \u201crock, paper, scissors\u201d is the inspiration for an uplifting story of misfits forming unlikely friendships to underline the brand\u2019s \u201ctogether, not the same\u201d philosophy.

As Beijing steps up its crackdown on political dissent, the film\u2019s disappearance has left some moviegoers scratching their heads and wondering whether the long hand of the mainland authorities may be responsible. The timing of attacks from the mainland and the content of Ten Years appears to bear this out. The film is a dystopian narrative composed of five short stories in which Hong Kong has been totally taken over by China to the point that neither the language, Cantonese, nor local agricultural products can be freely used. The film first hit the screens at a local film festival in November before getting a wider release the following month. But general release ended in January \u2013 when it was still playing to full houses. That move coincided with a forthright attack China\u2019s Global Times \u2013 the mainland mouthpiece of the Communist party \u2013 labelling the film \u201cabsurd\u201d, \u201ctoo pessimistic\u201d and a \u201cvirus of the mind\u201d.

The website portal QQ.com has followed suit, and it will not cover the Awards. Ten Years has been nominated as one of the films of the year in both awards. Shu Kei, a film critic and professor at Hong Kong\u2019s Academy for Performing Arts says China\u2019s reaction is a mistake. \u201cI think it is stupid, of course, for China to cancel the broadcasts. But this is always their reaction when they do not want people to know more about something. \u201cThis is a very important film. The first in decades that tackles the reality in Hong Kong,\u201d he says.

According to Choi they pulled it \u201cthey had too many other films to show\u201d. But Ten Years was grossing more than Star Wars at one of its outlets, Broadway Cinematheque, when its run ended. \u201cI have never heard anywhere else that a film that sells full houses at every single screening is pulled out from the theatres, but no exhibitor will admit to censorship or direct pressure from China,\u201d says Shu Kei. None of this has deterred its fans. The film has since been showing at private screening at universities and other rented venues. It is advertised through a Facebook page, and still gets daily full houses. \u201cWe actually prefer it this way, as this gives us a chance to talk with our audience afterwards,\u201d says Chow Kwun-wai, one of the directors.

Indian Wells and the Miami Open provide the tennis world a look at the biggest stars as the tour rumbles towards the French Open and Wimbledon. Last year, Indian Wells had one of those \u201cEarth stood still\u201d episodes when Serena Williams\u00a0decided to end her 14-year unofficial boycott. The original decision to stay away from the event came after allegations of racist abuse towards the sisters at Indian Wells in 2001 (that Serena was booed by American fans in the final against a foreign opponent, Kim Clijsters, is beyond doubt). It was a watershed moment and another step taken in tennis\u2019 awkward dealings with black people and race. This year, Indian Wells will have another striking return when Venus Williams returns to the tournament for the first time in 15 years. And though it is significant news in itself, her return has received little attention, overshadowed by Maria Sharapova\u2019s failed drug test and Serena\u2019s presence last year.   Related: What everyone is getting wrong about Serena Williams' return to Indian Wells    About the only thing that seemed more unlikely for years than a 35-year-old Sjogren\u2019s Syndrome stricken Venus being back in the top 10 at the end of 2015 was her playing at Indian Wells again. But her sister\u2019s much publicized choice to make peace with the California desert tennis community, and the overwhelmingly positive reception that Serena received last year, spurred the elder Williams to participate at the prestigious event at least once more in her career. Venus comes into Indian Wells seeking her 50th\u00a0singles title after a fine performance against a rather pedestrian field in Taiwan. That tournament win, where she didn\u2019t drop a set en route to the title, was a nice consolation prize for the disappointment she felt after losing in the opening round of the Australian Open to eventual semi-finalist and British No1 Johanna Konta.  The annoyance of that Konta defeat, coupled with losing a marathon contest to Russian teenager Daria Kasatkina to start the year in Auckland, brought questions again as to whether Venus could truly sustain an elite level at her age.\u00a0 But the win in Taiwan and return to Indian Wells signal the remarkable desire and love for the game the seven-time grand slam singles champion still has. \u00a0 Make no mistake, Venus did not owe it to herself or anyone else to create a new chapter in her Indian Wells story, just like her sister last year. Chatter around how refreshing and mature it was for Serena to show reconciliation was foolish then and foolish now if applied to Venus as well. Especially by tennis media figures who aren\u2019t black and do not fully understand the painful dynamics of the acerbic treatment the entire Williams family received during Serena\u2019s final with Ciljsters in 2001. Again, the right decision for them would not be whether they decided to return but whether they decided\u00a0at all, regardless of their final choice. It\u2019s why it was comforting for the eloquent Venus to share her thoughts on that tumultuous experience again. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI remember the hurt I felt. I remember my confusion and disappointment and anger,\u201d a candid Venus\u00a0wrote on The Players\u2019 Tribune. \u201cI remember how the coverage of it at the time didn\u2019t seem concerned with me and Serena, as people, at all \u2014 but rather only with the story itself. And with the version of the story that would get the most attention, regardless of the truth. I remember feeling that I had been wronged, and that I had done nothing wrong. I remember feeling that I had unfairly gotten the brunt of the blame for a bad situation.\u201d Moreover, it was good to see Venus cite her little sister as being the catalyst in swaying her change of heart.  \u201cAnd it was in that moment, seeing Serena welcomed with open arms last year at Indian Wells, that I think I fully and truly realized what being the big sister means,\u201d she added. \u201cIt means that, for all of the things I did first, and all of the times when I paved the way for Serena, the thing I can be most proud of is\u00a0this\u00a0time. When Serena paved the way for me.\u201d As Venus outlined, just because she is more calm on court than her sibling doesn\u2019t mean she has no edge to her. Leaving aside her continuing to be a remarkable competitor more than two decades after turning pro, there is a willingness to fight for the injustices she sees. It\u2019s why she fought so hard for equal prize money for women at grand slams. That steely resolve is also why she is respected by many in the WTA locker room while still keeping close to a tight inner circle. Trust has to be earned for Venus to be comfortable with a person, and when that trust is breached, as she and her family felt it was that controversial day in 2001, then Venus will cut off a relationship. Fortunately for fans at Indian Wells, Serena has allowed her to return to a place where trust was broken. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a week where tennis and, in particular, the WTA has been rocked by the Sharapova controversy (the tour decided to give its players\u00a0a guide to how to best answer any questions\u00a0about the Russian star\u2019s admission), seeing Venus play in Indian Wells is a major blessing that they can take solace in. And no one inside the tennis world should take it for granted or overlook it.\u00a0 "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/mar/13/sardinian-professor-fighting-to-save-gaelic-bilingualism", "publicationDate": "2016-03-13T00:05:32Z", "tags": ["Language", "Languages", "Education", "UK news", "Science", "Dementia", "Society"], "sentences": ["\u25a0 Pan Jin-Yu valiantly tried to teach younger people the Pazeh language of Taiwan but it vanished when she died in October 2010."], "title": "The Sardinian professor fighting to save Gaelic \u2013 and all Europe\u2019s minority tongues", "article": "It is an impending extinction that will change the world and how people communicate: within 20 years, half of all the planet\u2019s languages will be dead. Experts agree that nothing can stop it happening but one academic is trying her hardest to slow it down, to help preserve what may be part of a golden ticket for our brains. Professor Antonella Sorace \u2013 a Sardinian who was discouraged from learning her own dying language in favour of \u201cproper\u201d Italian \u2013 is one of a growing number who believe learning a second language has enormous untapped benefits for the human brain. This is true not only for young children but also for adults and people at risk from dementia, where research consistently shows that learning a new language could delay the onset of the disease for four to five years \u2013 a better result than with any medication to date. It is those benefits of bilingualism that should encourage us to preserve and protect Britain\u2019s minority languages \u2013 Gaelic, Manx, Welsh, Irish, Cornish and Ulster Scots, she says. \u201cAll minority languages are declining,\u201d said Sorace, professor of developmental linguistics at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cIf a language is not learned by children then that language is bound to die. There are big forces out there that help to speed this process along. Eventually Gaelic will die, Welsh and Sardinian will die. Many of these are languages that are still relatively healthy; others are being actively suppressed or stigmatised. \u201cWe are trying to contribute to slowing that decline. We know linguistic diversity is important because it makes us human. We lose that and we lose an essential part of what it means to be human.\u201d   Related: Bilingualism is good for you. But monoglots needn't despair | David Shariatmadari    Already her work and the project she founded three years ago in Edinburgh, Bilingualism Matters \u2013 now expanding across Europe and in the US \u2013 have convinced the Scottish government to introduce languages to primary schools. From 2020 all Scottish children will be learning a language other than English in their first year at school, with two other languages being introduced later. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the teaching, but young children are adept at picking up tones, so tonal languages, like Mandarin for example, are a lot easier for children than for adults,\u201d she said. Just as disappearing forests take with them secrets of undiscovered medicines, disappearing languages can take the key to a longer and better quality of life. The first battle is to unpick the popular myth that bilingualism might damage children\u2019s brains. There were even suggestions it could encourage schizophrenia. Study after study has shown the reverse to be true, says Sorace. \u201cThese prejudices are ingrained, but we are perhaps halfway to persuading people that the brain can cope. Then we have to persuade people that it is actually of benefit. \u201cIn Sardinia, if a child speaks Sardinian it\u2019s thought they can\u2019t then speak Italian very well. There is an inferiority complex around these languages. My mother insisted I speak Italian, not this common dialect.\u201d Bilingualism Matters is working to encourage businesses to consider the benefits of their staff learning languages. \u201cIn business, people say \u2018English is the language of business, why would I need to learn another language?\u2019\u201d said Sorace. \u201cMaybe it would mean you could do better business.\u201d There is also the question of how long English can hold its dominance, not only because of the possibility of leaving the EU but also because of China\u2019s emergence as an economic force. The British are notoriously poor at languages, and interest in taking the subject among schoolchildren has been waning for years \u2013 encouraged, Sorace thinks, by parents who do not understand their value. \u201cMonolingualism is a privilege, but also a limitation. Why is Chinese emerging as a powerful language? Because the economy is. The pace is much more rapid than it used to be, so who knows how long it might take for Mandarin to overtake English?\u201d The Scottish schools language initiative is expected to include Chinese as one of the three languages that will be introduced to primary curriculums. The refugee crisis is throwing up another concern for Sorace. Many people arriving in new countries are encouraged to take up the language of their new home instead of \u2013 rather than alongside \u2013 their own. \u201cIt is true that some families feel their home language is a problem. They want their child to fully integrate and they think their language will hold them back. This is sometimes the message that comes from the school.. \u201cEven in the Netherlands, a bilingual country, there is this message, you should speak Dutch as soon as possible. Yes of course you must learn to integrate, but don\u2019t speak Dutch to your child. Unfortunately we have this perception that there is a good kind of bilingualism and a bad kind. There is no bad kind.\u201d Her colleague and research collaborator, Thomas Bak, a reader in human cognitive neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh, agrees: \u201cIt is the most important change in our understanding of the brain in recent times. Now we know the brain is not static, a set of drawers where things are stored, it has an elasticity, a cerebral elastic. Now we know that brains adapt and adjust all our lifetime. If you start a sport late you may not get to the Olympics, but it will still impact positively on your health. That\u2019s how I look at it. Linguistics meets neuroscience.\u201d Bak also grew up \u201cprotected\u201d from what were then perceived as the dangers of bilingualism. \u201cAs a son of a Polish-speaking father and German-speaking mother in Krak\u00f3w, my parents took a considered decision to not teach me German, to protect me. They were educated people but thought they were doing what was best.\u201d In the 1960s there were academics linking a \u201cforeign language at home\u201d to \u201cmental retardation\u201d. But is taking up French really necessary to stave off dementia, as opposed to doing crosswords and sudoku? \u201cYes, to use the sports analogy, the fact that swimming is good for you is not to say tennis isn\u2019t,\u201d said Bak. \u201cBut with language it\u2019s not just words, its about sounds, social interaction, cultural interaction.\u201d He said there was already some early language research suggesting that the prevalence of dementia may already be declining. \u201cMaybe we are starting to see the first effects of people trying to avoid the risk factors. Bilingualism doesn\u2019t make you immortal, it doesn\u2019t cure dementia but it delays it. In stroke patients twice as many people in the bilingual group recovered their cognitive abilities completely after a stroke than monolinguals. The bilingual brain is better equipped to cope with the damage.\u201d LOST LANGUAGES \u25a0 The Bo language became extinct in January 2010 with the death of its last speaker Boa Sr in the Andaman Islands.

And wages are rising more slowly than we thought. And to hit a budget surplus just before 2020, we need another \u00a34bn cut in public spending. This is not great news for George Osborne going into this week\u2019s budget, but it is not his biggest problem. If you want to understand Osborne\u2019s biggest problem, listen to Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of Engand, who told the G20 summit in Shanghai last month that \u201cthe global economy risks becoming trapped in a low-growth, low-inflation, low-interest-rate equilibrium\u201d.   Related: The chancellor must be honest about the budget\u2019s implications | Letters    Carney warned the politicians of the 20 richest countries that, despite seven years of money-printing and near-zero interest rates, the vigour of monetary stimulus has \u201cnot been matched by structural measures\u201d. Or listen to Mario Draghi, who warned that the European Central Bank\u2019s massive stimulus programme, announced last week, is all that stands in the way of \u201cdisastrous deflation\u201d. Or the Bank for International Settlements chief, Claudio Borio, who told investors last month that the entire economic model based on debt-fuelled growth and financial excess \u201cneeds to be abandoned\u201d. Central bankers are reticent creatures, so when they actually warn of doom it is best to listen. For Osborne, what it means is that the post-2008 recovery is nearly over \u2013 and that he has failed to achieve any of the structural changes needed to survive what is coming. To use his own hackneyed metaphor, the sun was indeed shining \u2013 more accurately an artificial sun powered by a $12tn global money splurge. But he failed to fix what needed fixing, which was not the roof, but the foundations of Britain\u2019s economy. Let\u2019s acknowledge one achievement. He was right to abandon his own austerity plan, halving the deficit over five years instead of pursuing the ludicrously ideological aim of eradicating it. But he did this too late, and the cost was two years of flatlining growth. However, the Osborne recovery was bought at a strategic cost: abandoning the plan to rebalance the UK economy. The original idea was to move growth away from consumption towards investment; to replace a trade deficit with a trade surplus, and wean British households off ever-rising property values. It didn\u2019t happen. Public spending on infrastructure is set to be less than half what it was in the last year of the Labour government. Business investment improved, but in the last half of 2015, it went negative. Meanwhile, trade is still in substantial deficit. Beyond the figures, the visual symbols of Osborne\u2019s structural failure can be seen in any big town or city: apartments being built to satisfy a speculative property boom; streets full of coffee-shop chains for graduates to work in; and employment agencies, where you can sign on for one of the 1.5m zero hours jobs created since Osborne took the helm. Not all of this rebalancing fiasco is down to the chancellor\u2019s failings. For the entire first term of the coalition, the Eurozone stagnated because of the ECB\u2019s refusal to engage in stimulus. You can bow and scrape to Narendra Modi or Xi Jinping all you like, but it cannot compensate for stagnation on your doorstep. But the chancellor had choices. He could have set up a national or regional investment bank, instead of trying to simply privatise Lloyds and RBS. There could have been a coherent industrial strategy; posing in the graphene labs at Manchester University did not produce one \u2013 neither will handing the exploitation of graphene research to China and Taiwan. Above all, he could have ordered the Bank of England to meet its own targets. The 2% target Osborne mandated has not been met since 2012, and yet the Bank is always administered a pat on the head and allowed to \u201clook through\u201d the risk of deflation. If this is the last quarter of Osborne\u2019s time in the Treasury, the sterile correspondence with the bank will stand testimony to a government dead behind the eyes when it comes to monetary policy. The problem is that now his choices are limited. Productivity growth is poor \u2013 and will not increase as long as we go on creating low-paid, precarious jobs. Debt stands at 78% of GDP. And though the banking system has been stabilised, it is still highly exposed to global risks. So here\u2019s the brave thing to do: steal Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s clothes. In the face of a global slowdown, with deflation and stagnation haunting the G20, Osborne should unleash a pre-emptive monetary and fiscal stimulus. If you applied John McDonnell\u2019s new fiscal rule, eradicating the current budget deficit only by 2021, you would have tens of billions more to spend over the next five years. Osborne on Sunday signalled instead that he was determined to achieve a surplus by 2020 \u2013 even as the economy slows down. It has been done before. The last time Britain faced the challenge of stagnation, needless austerity and geopolitical turmoil \u2013 in the mid-1930s \u2013 it was a Tory chancellor, Sir John Simon, who switched the taps of public spending back on to fund Neville Chamberlain\u2019s re-armament programme, outflanking Labour in the process. Osborne\u2019s desire to achieve surplus has always been driven by the need for shock-absorbers when the next global recession hits. But the slowdown is happening now, and the economic forecasters, EY Item Club, now says there is a 30% chance of a global recession. In the face of this, Osborne should design a Tory version of \u201cpeople\u2019s quantitative easing\u201d: since the ECB is now buying company debt and bank debt at rates that give away money for free, Osborne should signal the Bank of England to do likewise by raising its inflation target. The scale of the problem signalled by stagnant global growth, negative interest rates and financial turbulence means Britain needs a second stimulus \u2013 done this time in a way that moves us away from import dependence, precarious work and low pay. Wednesday is Osborne\u2019s last chance to prove he can think outside the austerity box."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/15/bicycle-kingdom-reborn-pavement-cycling-taipei-taiwan", "publicationDate": "2016-03-15T10:07:18Z", "tags": ["Cities", "Taiwan", "Taiwan holidays", "Cycling", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Travel", "Life and style", "Women", "Transport policy", "Environment", "City transport"], "sentences": ["But in the capital of Taiwan \u2013 an island once known as \u201cthe Bicycle Kingdom\u201d \u2013 the authorities have taken the unusual step of legalising cycling on 240 miles of city centre pavement.", "Many YouBike riders are women \u2026 and few wear helmets    Taiwan earned its Bicycle Kingdom monicker in the 1980s, when the island\u2019s factories turned out more bikes than any other country in the world and the \u2018Made in Taiwan\u2019 label was ubiquitous.", "Facing increased competition from mainland China in the late 90s, Taiwanese bike manufacturers responded by ceding the low-cost end of the market, and concentrating on higher-spec machines."], "title": "Return of the Bicycle Kingdom? How pavement cycling is transforming Taipei", "article": "A swarm of scooters forms at the head of a queue of traffic waiting for the lights to change. Visors down, engines revving, they jockey for position ahead of the cars, trucks and buses on a specially marked patch of tarmac reserved for cyclists in many parts of the world. The buzz rises to a high-pitched crescendo and, as the lights turn green, they shoot off. A minute later the lights change and the process begins again. Taipei is home to almost one million scooters \u2013 as well as 2.7 million people. Like many other large Asian cities, the roads here are seen as no place for cyclists. But in the capital of Taiwan \u2013 an island once known as \u201cthe Bicycle Kingdom\u201d \u2013 the authorities have taken the unusual step of legalising cycling on 240 miles of city centre pavement. Taipei is also tripling its network of cycle lanes to cover 120 miles over the next three years \u2013 although these too are strips of painted sidewalk taken from pedestrians. Strange as it may seem, it works. Riding on the pavement feels 100% safe \u2013 for cyclists at least \u2013 and many of the riders are women, pedalling along at a leisurely pace and with hardly a helmet in sight. Picking your way through the city-centre pedestrians during rush hour may be pretty impossible, but in general the numbers are encouraging: whereas six or seven years ago few cyclists were to be seen in the city, now around 5% of journeys are taken by bike. That\u2019s around double the cycle modal share of London, for example, and four-times that of New York.     Taipei before cars, scooters and multi-level highways. Photograph: Taipics.com      YouBike has changed the image of the city. It\u2019s one of the city government\u2019s most popular policies  King Liu     \u201cWe want to be a cycle-friendly city, but we\u2019re not trying to be like Amsterdam or Copenhagen,\u201d Anne Chung, transport commissioner for Taipei, tells me on the sidelines of the VeloCity global cycling conference, which is taking place in Asia for the first time. \u201cThere are too many scooters and motorbikes at the moment and it is too dangerous to ride on the road with them, so the pavement is safer for cyclists. We want people to make cycling part of their lives and be able to combine cycling with the metro and buses for the \u2018last mile\u2019 of their journeys. We want to be able to tell car and motorbike users that there is a smarter way to get around.\u201d The YouBike cycle share system, a public-private partnership between manufacturer Giant and the city authorities, plays a key role. Since its launch in 2009, the YouBike network has grown to 7,000 bikes at more than 200 locations, most of them strategically placed next to metro stations and bus stops. Each bike is used an average of 8.6 times a day \u2013 the highest turnover rate in the world \u2013 and by 2018 the system will have grown to almost double its present size.   The transformation of Taipei: Fuxing Road - before and after Fuxing Road before and after: a lane was taken from cars and a segregated cycle lane built on the widened pavement   At the same time, Taipei has announced plans to more than triple the length of its network of segregated city centre bike lanes to 120 miles by 2019. In addition, there are 240 miles of shared use pavements, and 70 miles of riverside cycleways outside the city\u2019s flood defence levees, which are hugely popular with leisure cyclists at weekends. Combined with the implementation of on-street parking fees for cars and scooters, the approach seems to be working \u2013 a survey showed an estimated 31.2% of people riding YouBikes had switched from motorbikes and 4.4% from private cars.      Many YouBike riders are women \u2026 and few wear helmets    Taiwan earned its Bicycle Kingdom monicker in the 1980s, when the island\u2019s factories turned out more bikes than any other country in the world and the \u2018Made in Taiwan\u2019 label was ubiquitous. Facing increased competition from mainland China in the late 90s, Taiwanese bike manufacturers responded by ceding the low-cost end of the market, and concentrating on higher-spec machines. Giant and Merida have grown to become two of the world\u2019s biggest bike companies, and international firms such as Specialized, Trek and Colnago have manufacturing sites on the island. Recently, this interest in high-end bikes has found expression in the huge popularity of cycle tours of the island. Taipei\u2019s mayor, Ko Wen-je, completed a 325-mile route last month, topping a previous 235-mile excursion. Giant\u2019s president and founder, King Liu, has completed the full island circuit twice \u2013 the first time at the age of 73, and the second at 80 \u2013 cutting his time from 15 days to 12. Liu, now 82, calls his colourful, sturdy YouBikes the \u201clast piece of puzzle\u201d in Taipei\u2019s transformation. \u201cIt seemed impossible to introduce bike share with so many motorbikes and scooters,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAt the start the media, the public and politicians all disagreed with the vision of bike share. Motorbikes had dedicated lanes, but not cyclists. The rights of cyclists were not being taken care of well by the government. It took tense negotiations, but it passed in the end. \u201cIn the past you wouldn\u2019t see many people cycling in Taipei \u2013 but now, with YouBike, it has changed participation and the image of the city. It has become one of the city government\u2019s most popular policies.\u201d    You can take your bike into the public toilet with you in Taipei.

Back inside the levee walls we negotiate the roads under a series of elevated highways \u2013 some double, some triple-deckers \u2013 and dive into the narrow streets of Wanhua, one of the city\u2019s oldest districts. Shared pavements here often run through the tight gap between lines of parked scooters and busy shop doorways. We stick to the road. Heading into the modern central business district and towards Taipei 101 \u2013 the world\u2019s tallest skyscraper until it was usurped by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai \u2013 we encounter proper protected cycle ways. When major thoroughfares such as Xinyi and Fuxing were remodelled with new underground metro lines, the city authorities took the chance to grab a lane of traffic from cars and widen the pavement. A slice of that sidewalk was then painted as a cycle lane.    Related: Viva la revoluci\u00f3n: Mexico City cyclists fight for the right to ride in safety    The segregated lanes disappear into shared pavements at major junctions and metro stations, and what with all those rush-hour pedestrians, there\u2019s potential for conflict \u2013 but in a few days cycling around the city, I didn\u2019t see any. Even the car drivers pushing through pedestrian crossings on red were generally cautious and polite. Charles Lin, deputy mayor of Taipei and a professor in urban planning, sees cycling as part of his strategy to make the city more liveable and sustainable by 2050. \u201cPeople have always said that form follows function, but the way I see it, form follows mobility,\u201d he says. \u201cMobility decides the image of the city \u2013 how we are perceived by visitors \u2013 and the way we move determines the way we live in the city.

The latest Pisa tests, from 2013, put England in 26th place for maths, behind countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.   Related: A fifth of adults have forgotten how to do fractions or percentages    Last summer, 37% of the cohort failed to achieve a grade C or above in GCSE maths. Of those who were retaking \u2013 as required by the government \u2013 the figures were worse, with 64% failing to get the required C. Last weekend, the international education expert Andreas Schleicher told a conference that British schoolchildren were falling behind in maths because lessons in the subject were \u201ca mile wide and an inch deep\u201d. Schleicher, who is in charge of the Pisa tests, which are conducted on behalf of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), said maths teaching in the UK was superficial because it focused on memorising facts, rather than concepts. The government is running an exchange programme with schools in Shanghai, where students are among the highest scoring in Pisa tests, in an attempt to improve maths education in England. Powell said: \u201cWith concerns from the OECD about the quality of the maths curriculum in schools and cuts to post-16 education, which have seen sixth-form colleges dropping Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) A-levels, it is hard to see how the Tories can achieve it under the current circumstances.\u201d   Related: A good memory is not a sign of education | Letters    A Department for Education spokesperson stressed the chancellor had announced a review and no final decisions had been made, but ministers are known to be concerned that far fewer students continue to study maths to 18 in England than in comparable countries.

Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cWe need to understand why the government\u2019s new reformed maths GCSE is not felt sufficient for the needs of young people. We would also question where the extra maths teachers would be found given the current recruitment crisis.\u201d  Smith carried out an inquiry into post-14 mathematics education for the government in 2003-04 and was previously director general of knowledge and innovation in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. He was unavailable for comment. Jill Stokoe, policy adviser for the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said evidence showed that many students struggled with maths, even at GCSE level. \u201cI think we would put a lot of students off staying in sixth form if they had to carry on doing maths,\u201d she said. \u201cWe already know there\u2019s a shortage of maths teachers; who would be teaching all these extra students?\u201d Schleicher, speaking before the Global Education and Skills Forum in Dubai at the weekend, described what was lacking in maths teaching in the UK. \u201cOne of the things that we see when you look at high-performing education systems in maths, they typically have three things in the curriculum; one is rigour, the second is focus and the third is coherence. \u201cRigour means really having a high level of cognitive demand, and the UK is not doing well on it. Basically, the UK has a curriculum that is a mile wide and an inch deep, in the sense that a lot of the learning in maths is rather superficial.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/16/taipei-taiwan-bike-sharing-environment-cycline-air-pollution", "publicationDate": "2016-03-16T21:30:06Z", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Taiwan", "Asia", "Cycling", "Pollution", "Environment", "Asia Pacific", "Life and style", "World news"], "sentences": ["The Taiwanese capital has 7,264 of them, and their distinctive orange frames, yellow fenders and smiley face logo are nearly as common in some parts of town as the city\u2019s ubiquitous motor scooters.", "\u201cI\u2019d pay around 20 Taiwan dollars ($0.65) for the metro, but I think the bike rental costs less in the first half hour."], "title": "Gearing up: how Taipei's bike-sharing program is transforming citizens' commute", "article": "Taipei\u2019s rental bikes are hard to miss. The Taiwanese capital has 7,264 of them, and their distinctive orange frames, yellow fenders and smiley face logo are nearly as common in some parts of town as the city\u2019s ubiquitous motor scooters. Last year, the city\u2019s bike rental program logged more than 20m trips, a stunning figure that becomes slightly less surprising when one considers that the bikes rent for as little as $0.15 per half hour from 222 self-service, card-activated storage lots.   Related: Return of the Bicycle Kingdom? How pavement cycling is transforming Taipei    It\u2019s hard to believe that, just four years ago, the program was on the edge of collapse, done in by a lack of rental docks and a scarcity of viable bike lanes in the city\u2019s choked streets. After a brief burst of enthusiasm, cycling became an unpopular method of transportation as citizens tried to save gas money during the global financial crisis. The city worked with Giant Manufacturing, the company that produces the bikes, to turn its bike rental program around. Giant upgraded its fleet to include mini locks, strong braking systems and bikes that change gears \u2013 a move that cut down on the number of repair jobs and broken bikes. For its part, the city added rental stations and bikes near metro stations and bus stops, areas where commuters who normally walk to work might be interested in a more convenient alternative. The city will continue this trend: by 2019, it plans to spend about $32m on more bikes and more places to rent them. It aims to open a total of 400 rental stations by 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s convenient,\u201d says 35-year-old Taipei dance instructor Vivian Chen, a rental bike rider of three years. \u201cTake today,\u201d she continues, pulling out of a rental station in February. \u201cI\u2019d pay around 20 Taiwan dollars ($0.65) for the metro, but I think the bike rental costs less in the first half hour. And it would take me longer by metro because my destination isn\u2019t right on the train line. I would need to walk a ways to get there.\u201d     YouBike renters park after a ride in Taipei on March 16, 2016. Photograph: Ralph Jennings    Public relations and public transportation For Giant Manufacturing, which sells its bikes through 12,000 retailers in 50 countries, Taipei\u2019s rental program isn\u2019t a big money maker. It breaks even on the program, says Liu Li-chu, a spokesperson for Giant subsidiary YouBike. However, the program gives the company an opportunity to introduce potential customers to the benefits of cycling while building public good will toward its brand. Li-Chu, who is also the daughter of 82-year-old King Liu, Giant\u2019s founder and CEO, says that her father doesn\u2019t just make and sell bikes. \u201cHe rides and thinks other people should ride,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re putting good bikes in front of citizens and saying, \u2018Ride and see You\u2019ll fall in love. These bikes are addictive.\u2019\u201d For Taipei, building a loyal ridership was a challenge. One of the city\u2019s strategies was to offer the first half-hour free, a move that attracted masses of short-distance commuters in the cost-conscious city. Rentals doubled to 22m between 2013 and 2014, and city officials hope they would help to reduce air pollution and rush hour traffic congestion. \u201cThat initial thing about getting users in for free and getting them used to bikes \u2013 that was everything,\u201d said Anthony van Dyck, a Canadian expatriate in Taipei who follows YouBike as founder of an informational website for foreigners. \u201cThat and they never stopped adding bikes and adding stations.\u201d     Public bike rental programs have grown worldwide and can be found in nearly 1,000 cities by the end of 2015, says Bikesharingmap.com. Illustration: Russell and Alexandre Meddin of Bikesharingmap.com    The next struggle is traffic management. Many drivers in Taipei do not observe the designated bike lanes. On some streets, bikes compete for right-lane space with scooters, bus stops and double-parked cars. Sidewalks can be packed with pedestrians and shopping arcades. \u201cWe\u2019re now making plans for education and promotion work,\u201d said Liu Chia-yu, a division chief under the city\u2019s transportation department. \u201cFor bike riders, we\u2019re saying not to compete with pedestrians, and for people on foot, if you run into a bike give it some space.\u201d   Related: Where is the most cycle-friendly city in the world?    A growing solution Public bike rental programs are a growing solution for cities. According to Jack Oortwijn, editor of Netherlands-based magazine Bike Europe, between 600 and 800 cities currently have them. They have already changed commuting and tourism for European cities such as Amsterdam and Copenhagen, where half the population gets to work by bike. Paris\u2019s bike program logged more than 200m rentals within seven years of its 2007 launch. Public bike programs are expanding across Asia, too. Japanese tourist mecca Kyoto has one, and Korean capital Seoul launched a system like Taipei\u2019s in late 2015. It plans to expand city-wide by 2020 with as many as 20,000 bikes. Meanwhile, numerous cities in China, including Beijing, also rent bikes to the public. Hangzhou, a city of 7 million people near Shanghai, leads Asia \u2013 if not the world \u2013 with more than 78,000 rental bikes. However, in many crowded cities \u2013 particularly in the developing world \u2013 bike programs are still an unaffordable luxury. Part of the problem also lies with the public image of bikes as a symbol of poverty, Oortwijn says. Research has shown that the image problem happens in industrialized or developing countries. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of priorities and awareness,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem with city councils is that they\u2019re not aware of the possibilities that bicycles can offer. In developing countries bicycles are regarded as the poor man\u2019s transport. That negative image is still there.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/mar/18/cousteau-celine-mexico-diving-amazon-coast-ocean-sea", "publicationDate": "2016-03-18T13:03:01Z", "tags": ["North and Central America holidays", "Mexico holidays", "Travel", "Adventure travel", "Diving holidays", "Amazon holidays", "South America holidays", "Oceans", "Environment"], "sentences": ["My son is four and until he was two he travelled everywhere with us \u2013 Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, the Gal\u00e1pagos."], "title": "\u2018I\u2019m passionate about the ocean\u2019: C\u00e9line Cousteau on diving off the Americas", "article": "People always think that my grandfather Jacques or father [oceanographic explorer] Jean-Michel were my main influences.

This little town in the far south of Mexico\u2019s Baja California is basically a community of fisherman families who realised they were over-fishing their own backyard and created a marine protected area. They fish outside the protected section for commercial purposes and inside for what they can feed their family.

Photograph: Alamy    I have a lifelong connection to the Amazon. I flew down there with my grandfather to spend two weeks on his boat, the Calypso, when I was nine. My entire family were somewhere in the Amazon \u2013 my mother on a land expedition, my father and brother on a raft on another river. It really opened my eyes to another world. If we can give children an opportunity to experience other places and cultures in whatever way they can it profoundly changes who we are as adults. The Amazon tests you on a physical, emotional and mental level. I\u2019ve been working on a film and engagement campaign called Tribes on the Edge in the Brazilian Amazon for years and it will be released this year. It will tell the story of the tribes of the Vale do Javari indigenous territory. It\u2019s a complex area to work in \u2013 85,000sq km of jungle. We\u2019d go for two to three weeks at a time. There\u2019s a romantic notion of what such a place is like, but the reality is it\u2019s a very intense place to be.     A large school of yellowtail surgeonfish on the reef off Cabo Pulmo Photograph: Alamy    There\u2019s an incredible duality to tribal life. The people still hunt and fish for their food in the way they always have, but sometimes use guns instead of blowpipes and have a generator that comes on at 8pm and then house music starts pumping at one end of the village. But they are still connected to their ecosystem in a way that those of us who walk on concrete have forgotten.     C\u00e9line\u2019s grandfather, Jacques Cousteau.

But I was in awe. The nuances of the change of light on the ice and diving around an iceberg that is older than one can imagine puts you in your place as a very small being in time and space!

Holmes was training to be a navigator on board a British ship hauling a cargo of millet to Taiwan in the autumn of 1978. Off the Vietnamese coast, the hulking steel vessel crossed paths with a small, crowded and leaking wooden fishing boat holding Luisa Van Nu and 345 other people fleeing the communist takeover of their country. The refugees were into their fourth day at sea and hope for a new life had given way to despair as it seemed inevitable the boat would sink. Mothers pulled their children close. Fathers spilled regrets at taking their families to their deaths. Then the MV Wellpark, run by a Scottish shipping company, appeared out of the storm. The difficult and dramatic rescue earned its captain, Hector Connell, an MBE. But that recognition came only after the destitute refugees found themselves caught up in an international political wrangle over who would take them in. In the end, the then Labour government agreed to bring them to London despite the alarmist cries of Britain \u201cbeing full\u201d and warnings that it would open the door to floods of refugees. Holmes gave up his cabin for Van Nu\u2019s family. As she left the ship for London and a country she knew nothing about, the 19-year-old seaman handed her a keepsake. \u201cI had a necklace I\u2019d bought in Peru,\u201d Holmes recalled. \u201cIt was silver. A nautical wheel with a crucifix in the middle. I gave that to her and said: \u2018Remember us from the Wellpark.\u2019 She took off one of those pinky rings, her high school graduation ring, and gave it to me.\u201d    I heard someone say: \u2018This is it. The water\u2019s coming in and the boat will go down'    Holmes said he viewed the rescue as little more than a bit of adventure to break up a long sea voyage and it quickly slipped into history. He went on to captain his own ships before settling as a maritime pilot in New Zealand. \u201cMy dad had the ring for a while because, being older perhaps, he realised more what we\u2019d done than I did, really. He used to wear it around his neck on a chain. If he hadn\u2019t kept it, it might just have got lost, showing how vacuous I was at the time. When he died I got it back again and it sort of meant a bit more then.\u201d Holmes stuck the ring in his wife\u2019s jewellery box where it sat until word reached him that the Vietnamese rescued by the Wellpark were planning a 30th-anniversary reunion in California, where some had settled.     Safe haven: the rescued people look through donated clothing on the deck of the Wellpark. Photograph: Mike Newton    \u201cWhen I went to the reunion, I thought I\u2019ll take it and give it back to Luisa. She was quite emotional about getting it back after all those years,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me the rescue was just a night of adventure. What we\u2019d actually done didn\u2019t come home to me until I went to the reunion. There were a couple of boys, about four or five, and I suddenly thought: \u2018Fuck me, this is another generation.\u2019 These kids wouldn\u2019t be here if their mum hadn\u2019t been dragged on board the Wellpark. I realised then that what was a night of adventure for me was life or death to them.\u201d In October 1978, 346 people crammed into the three decks of the 60ft fishing boat to join one of the great migrations by sea of modern times. Around 800,000 boat people, as they became widely known, are believed to have fled Vietnam by sea. Many others drowned or were captured, raped and killed by pirates, particularly from Thailand. As the boat entered the Mekong Delta it damaged its rudder and lost its steering. The refugees headed out to sea with no idea where they were going. Among them was nine-year old Diep Quan, whose family had two strikes against it when South Vietnam fell to the communists because her father was a businessman and her parents were of Chinese ethnicity. On the day they left, her mother announced a family holiday. \u201cMy uncle came round with a truck because he was a goods driver. I was a city girl and all I remember is trees, jungle, mud. What\u2019s this about? This is a weird place for a holiday,\u201d she said. Then she saw the fishing boat moored on the Mekong River and understood she might never see Vietnam again.    My father gave me a tube of toothpaste. Inside was a $100 bill. He said: \u2018I\u2019ll see you later.'    Sitting in a London coffee shop, swinging between tears and laughter as she recalled a journey and a life that was very nearly cut short, Quan described the first day at sea as \u201ca paradise\u201d of infinite ocean and flying fish. Then the boat hit the wake of Typhoon Lola and started to fill with water. A chain of young men bailed out with buckets, but they could only delay the inevitable. The refugees spotted ships and fired flares, but either they were not seen or the crews ignored them. The captain told his passengers the boat could not struggle on much longer. \u201cI heard someone say: \u2018This is it now, the water\u2019s coming in and the boat will go down,\u2019\u201d said Quan. \u201cMy dad had been up on deck. He decided, if this is it then he\u2019s going to come and sit with his family. All the menfolk came and sat with their families.\u201d Quan wiped away a tear as she recounted, years later, asking her mother if her father ever regretted the decision to get on the boat. \u201cShe said, \u2018Of course he did.\u2019 When everyone had said, \u2018Right that\u2019s it, we\u2019re going to sink,\u2019 he was talking to my uncle and they were saying: \u2018We really shouldn\u2019t have done this. We\u2019ve taken everyone to their deaths,\u2019\u201d she said.     \u2018I\u2019m one of Thatcher\u2019s children\u2019: Diep Quan, now an IT trainer, at Morgan Stanley in Canary Wharf, London. Photograph: Suki Dhanda for the Observer    Two brothers, Hung and Huy Nguyen, were on board with their other siblings and parents, who owned a cinema chain in Saigon before it was seized by the new communist government. Hung was 18 and chose to leave even though he had won a prized place at medical school. \u201cThere was no question about whether I should go or not. As a medical student you are cream of the crop, but you\u2019re also government property,\u201d he said. \u201cGrowing up at that time, it really bothered me because of the freedom thing. They can stop you on the street and cut your hair if your hair is too long. When you talk, you have to watch your mouth.\u201d As the passengers grew more fearful, Hung\u2019s mother called for him and 15-year-old Huy to sit with her. \u201cShe called all the kids over so she could see us. We didn\u2019t really understand, but now we know,\u201d said Huy. One of their uncles, who Huy thinks may have been autistic, leapt over the side into the sea, saying he was going to swim back to Vietnam. Acceptance of what seemed like the inevitable was broken by someone shouting that they had spotted a ship. The captain fired a flare. It was seen by an officer on the Wellpark\u2019s bridge.    Someone tried to bring a\u00a0bag on board. I\u00a0said, \u2018No baggage.\u2019 They opened it and there was a kid inside    \u201cWe thought it was a battleship,\u201d said Huy. \u201cIn the night, it was lit up with all these cranes which looked like cannons.\u201d Captain Connell sent a lifeboat to investigate. Waiting anxiously on the fishing boat deck was Stephen Ngo, just 13 years old and the only child travelling on his own. Ngo had gone down to the boat to see off his older brothers, but his father sent him off instead at the last minute. \u201cHe gave me a tube of toothpaste. Inside that toothpaste was a $100 bill. He said: \u2018Take this with you and I\u2019ll see you later.\u2019\u201d Ngo would not see his father for years. The crew of the lifeboat struggled for hours, rowing through the heavy swell to make two trips picking up a few dozen refugees. Captain Connell decided to bring the ship alongside the fishing boat and take the refugees off directly. It was a remarkable act of seamanship. \u201cI was leaning over the side with a heaving line,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cSomeone tied it to a bag. I shouted down: \u2018No. No baggage. We\u2019ll get baggage later.\u2019 A guy on the boat opened the bag and there was a kid inside it.\u201d That was the end of the no-baggage policy. \u201cI lifted this kid up and that was the start of what turned out to be a good way to get the kids on board. Any kids that would fit into this red Adidas bag. I lost count of how many I brought up in that.\u201d At just four, Paul Tran was too small to climb. He was pulled up in a net. \u201cMy head banged on the ship as I was hauled up. Woke me up,\u201d he said.     \u2018For us, the crew were heroes\u2019: Diep Quan, middle row far right, with her sister. They are pictured on the Wellpark after being rescued. Photograph: Mike Newton    Most of the refugees were packed on to the decks in a makeshift village under tarpaulins strung over the hatch covers. \u201cThey just looked like poverty-stricken vagrants, really,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cSome of the kids were just in vests and nothing on the bottom at all.\u201d The Wellpark sailed on to Taiwan, where the government was sympathetic, sending food and clothes to the ship, but insisted they would not be allowed to leave the ship until the UK agreed to take them in. After two weeks of pictures of the destitute refugees on the news, the British government said it would bring them to London. \u201cThis is when we realised who we had on board,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cDoctors and nurses. A couple of lawyers. We had a whole typing pool. There were typewriters banging away, doing all the paperwork.\u201d The refugees were not universally pleased at being told they were going to Britain. Some were keener on the US, a country they knew more about. \u201cBack in Vietnam we had a very bad impression about the British,\u201d said Huy Nguyen. \u201cWe thought the British were very snobby. That they wore top hats and used their gloves to slap people\u2019s faces.\u201d The 346 were flown to Stansted airport and taken by coach to Kensington army barracks. \u201cWe arrived in the middle of the night,\u201d said Huy. \u201cIt was foggy and it was cold and it was really depressing. But when we got to the barracks people were waiting for us, to give us soup. They put flowers on our beds. Roses or coronations. I got a carnation. White. I was really happy.\u201d Gifts poured into the barracks. A circus visited, complete with an elephant for rides. Woolworths laid on a Christmas party for the children. The reception in the press was generally welcoming, even among tabloids as hostile to immigration then as they are now, perhaps because the Vietnamese were fleeing communism. The Daily Mail wrote: \u201cBecause we have closed the door to mass immigration \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 it does not mean we need be deaf to the knocking of some of those whose claim to help requires no passport or birth certificate to establish its piteous authenticity.\u201d But official hostility was rising. Within a few months Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, confronted with four more British ships rescuing hundreds of boat people. She was strongly against taking them in, ostensibly on the grounds of being \u201cfearful of UK public opinion\u201d, even though the UK had accepted only a tiny fraction compared to the 250,000 Vietnamese refugees admitted by the US and 60,000 by France. A Home Office memo warned that accepting more \u201cwould be seen as leading to an influx of immigrants which we could not control\u201d. Thatcher eventually relented over the ships already carrying boat people, but demanded \u201ca cast-iron position in legal and political terms which would enable the UK to hold out against admitting refugees\u201d. She also wanted Britain to withdraw from the 1951 refugee convention. All of this went largely unnoticed by those rescued by the Wellpark as they sought to map out a future in a strange land. Quan\u2019s father applied to emigrate to the US, but then the mayor of Peterborough turned up at the barracks offering homes to 10 families on a new estate. Three months later Quan moved north. Then came school, English lessons and cultural adjustments. \u201cI remember going down the corridor with one of the girls, chattering away in Cantonese. The deputy head \u2013 I was petrified of her \u2013 stopped us and said: \u2018No, no, no, you should be speaking English in school.\u2019 My dad found a job at a textile company owned by a Greek family. He would open up the factory first thing in the morning. At one point he spoke English with a Greek accent.\u201d Quan speaks with an unmistakable London accent. The Nguyen brothers have retained a Vietnamese inflection to their English as well as a disposition for finding humour in even the most difficult circumstances. Hung Nguyen was sent off to a school near Kensington barracks where he remembers a teacher called Elizabeth. \u201cShe taught us to use a fork. We\u2019d never seen one. It looked dangerous. Why would you stick it in your mouth? So we used spoons. After that they hid all the spoons. We stuck the knives in our mouths quite happily, but not forks.\u201d He described his school as \u201cvery rough\u201d and said: \u201cWe had to learn English and we also learned maths because it was the only thing we could do without fluent English.\u201d This was the 1970s, when the National Front and casual racism loomed large in Britain. \u201cWe had all the usual taunts walking to school \u2013 racist names,\u201d said Quan. \u201cI\u2019d hear stories from my mum all the time. The adults themselves felt it more keenly. They found it really hard.\u201d Others among the Wellpark refugees said they regularly found themselves in fights with racists at school or on the streets of the council estates where they lived. Some of the adults struggled with a new language and found only irregular work far below the professional positions they had once held. But, in time, their children thrived. Within a few weeks of arriving at Kensington barracks, Hung Nguyen landed a job with a project distributing second-hand books to developing countries. It was run by Lady Ranfurly, later famed for her extraordinary wartime diaries, To War With Whitaker. She offered to help Hung resume his medical studies. \u201cShe was an older lady,\u201d he said, \u201cClassy. I was cocky. I turned it down because I wanted to do it on my own.\u201d The British Council for Refugees gave Hung a scholarship to study English in Saffron Walden. In the holidays he went on a trip with his mother to visit relatives in America. They encouraged him to apply for medical school there and he was accepted. \u201cSo I stayed,\u201d he said. \u201cI became a foreign student from England,\u201d he added, laughing at the thought. After his medical degree, he studied for an MBA and in time did well out of the considerable overlap between medicine and business in the US. Today, Hung Nguyen owns an entire block in an area southeast of Los Angeles known as Little Saigon, home to the largest gathering of Vietnamese outside their home country. It holds his medical practice, a dentist\u2019s office and a chemist. His company is named Wellpark Inc and, outside, he is building a memorial to the ship that rescued him. Hung also hosts a weekly medical phone-in on local radio in Vietnamese. \u201cSometimes I talk about the Wellpark. I say: \u2018There are people who helped us who some of them forget. They don\u2019t even remember. They don\u2019t realise how much impact what they did had. But we remember and we might never be able to pay them back, but we can pay it forward. We can help other people in their honour.\u2019\u201d A decade after he moved to California his parents followed and opened a launderette. About a dozen of the Wellpark families settled in the US. The bulk remained in Britain, including Huy. He took a degree in civil engineering after calling the University of Manchester and asking to be put through to the engineering department. \u201cThey said: \u2018What engineering?\u2019 I said: \u2018I don\u2019t know, give me any.\u2019 So they connected me to civil engineering. They said: \u2018You sure you know what civil engineering is?\u2019 I didn\u2019t know, but I didn\u2019t want to admit it. So I said: \u2018Yeah, I know.\u2019 I ended up doing civil engineering. I love it.\u201d Huy is now a consultant for Transport for London, modelling how to manage the city\u2019s traffic \u2013 overground, underground and on the river. Diep Quan studied for a degree in business and accounts. \u201cI\u2019m one of Thatcher\u2019s children. Business. Got to go make money. Still didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do. I just knew that was the stepping stone to get to where the money is.\u201d Today, she works as an IT trainer on contract to Morgan Stanley. Over the years Hung Nguyen wondered what had become of the Wellpark\u2019s crew and his fellow refugees. He helped organise a 30th- anniversary reunion in 2008 in Little Saigon. Captain Connell went. So did Holmes, returning the ring to Luisa Van Nu. Hung took his four children, then aged 10 to 16. \u201cI told them: \u2018If it wasn\u2019t for these people you wouldn\u2019t be here. None of us would be here.\u2019 \u201cWe were lucky. We should be dead now. There were 346 people on that boat. Now we\u2019ve multiplied to the thousands. We had kids and our kids had kids. Looking at the pictures from the ship, sometimes I cry, by myself so people don\u2019t see.\u201d     Back to business: Dr Hung Nguyen, who now lives and works in Los Angeles, with his family. Photograph: Barry J Holmes for the Observer    After the success of the California reunion, Quan organised a follow-up in London five years later. \u201cGrowing up in Peterborough I\u2019d often wonder where the crew were now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a very emotional event to meet all these people at last. For us, they were heroes. We wanted to show them our children. We wanted to say: \u2018Look, they wouldn\u2019t be here if you hadn\u2019t been there for us.\u2019 It was a huge thing that they did. They could have chosen to turn a blind eye like the other ships. But they didn\u2019t and they risked a lot to rescue us.\u201d Holmes said he was uncomfortable at the outpouring of emotion from the survivors. \u201cThe MBE didn\u2019t sit comfortably at all with Hector Connell,\u201d he said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t think of himself as a hero. None of us did. The reunion was at a restaurant in Little Saigon. They presented me with a glass with a map of the South China Sea: \u2018In appreciation of your heroic and humane act for giving 346 people a second chance in life.\u2019 I told them anyone would have done the same thing. We just happened to be there at the time. But they wouldn\u2019t hear it.\u201d The reunion was also a chance for the Wellpark refugees to compare the different paths their lives had taken since the rescue. A consensus emerged that the US was the place to end up if you wanted to make money, but that Americans spent too much time working. Hung Nguyen, who has become a millionaire and drives a Mercedes-Benz, said he sometimes envied his brother Huy\u2019s lifestyle in London. \u201cLife there is much better. Here in America we work very hard. He has long vacations, goes on holiday to the Philippines with his wife. It kills me.\u201d Huy has no regrets about staying in London. \u201cThe British gave me everything \u2013 it\u2019s now my time to pay back,\u201d he said, speaking after a day of jury duty at Croydon Crown Court. \u201cWhen I pay tax I don\u2019t complain.\u201d Few of the people rescued by the Wellpark imagined ever returning to Vietnam, but in recent years the country has opened up and many of the thousands who fled have visited their homeland. They recount similar experiences of being stunned by the scale of change and the difficulty of finding former homes. Hung Nguyen has gone back to Vietnam twice. \u201cThey\u2019re not communists any more. They\u2019re capitalists! We call them red capitalists. Lots of rich people. Filthy rich. Lots of poor people. \u201cI went to visit my friends from high school. They all looked a lot older than I do. We\u2019re the same age, but it\u2019s a harder life there for them.\u201d Paul Tran was four years old when he was rescued by the Wellpark and had no memory of Vietnam. But he has returned repeatedly and developed a close attachment to the country he was born in. \u201cMy parents left the country because of that regime. Yet I\u2019m going back of my own choice to understand my roots a bit better and meet guys about the same age as me and hear their stories and histories. I keep going back because I like our culture. I like our country. I\u2019ve had thoughts about whether it would have been better if my family had stayed. But I\u2019m comfortable in my own skin here. I could have been a right dickhead over there. I could have been a spoilt kid, I could have been a gangster. Now I\u2019m well British, but with a Vietnamese culture.\u201d Quan organised an extended family holiday to her birthplace in 2012. Eighteen people, including her husband and their daughter, who had never been to Vietnam, travelled around the city she knew as Saigon in a minibus. She said that by the time the visit was over she knew she belonged in London more than Vietnam, even if that was her history. But she suspected her father felt differently. \u201cI think my dad never wanted to leave,\u201d said Quan. \u201cHe lost everything. I think it broke him in lots of ways. I don\u2019t think he ever recovered from it. Not just from a money perspective. I think it broke him as a person. \u201cMy sisters say: \u2018We\u2019re the age our dad was when he left. What if I now had to lock my front door and get on the boat and head down the estuary? Don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going, but I can\u2019t stay here.\u2019 What would make you so afraid? What would scare you so much that you would do that? You lose everything. It\u2019s quite hard for someone to imagine that.\u201d Which is why the flow of refugees from Syria to Europe has resonance for the former boat people. \u201cI cried when I saw the news about Germany taking all those refugees,\u201d said Huy. \u201cI was quite surprised they were that open to that many people. I was really moved by what the Germans did. I think the British could have done more.\u201d Quan is frustrated by what she describes as a lack of compassion for the Syrians, even if she understands it is at least in part driven by fear of terrorism. Tran said he saw himself in the pictures of Syrians marching across Europe. \u201cWhen I saw the footage, I put myself in their position because I was in that sort of position. I started having all these questions. Were they forced to leave? Were they kicked out? And then I thought, were we forced to leave? No. It was our choice to leave. And I thought, \u2018Maybe for some it was their choice to leave and maybe others had no choice because of war,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do I feel? It\u2019s like what most humans would do. They\u2019re very desperate people to want to leave. Like our families were.\u201d Vietnam: the exodusTwo million people fled Vietnam between the end of the war in 1975 and the opening up of the country in the mid-1990s. Almost 800,000 left by sea, most headed for Hong Kong, Malaysia or Indonesia. Widely known as \u2018boat people\u2019, the majority left in the late 1970s, often not surviving the treacherous journey because their boats sank or were attacked by pirates. Those people who reached land usually found themselves in refugee camps, as other countries in southeast Asia were reluctant to accept them. The majority were eventually taken in by the US, though Australia and Canada also welcomed substantial numbers. Although the boat people never expected to return to Vietnam, at least while the communist government was in power, many have since visited their homeland.

Dyson said its growth in 2015 was driven by battery-powered purifiers, fans and vacuum cleaners, with Asia overtaking Europe to become its biggest market.  Sales of battery-driven vacuum cleaners grew 66% in 2015 and the company now accounts for a quarter of this market around the world. Cordless models such as the V6 have become its top-selling vacuum cleaners, rather than the traditional corded upright versions. The company, which is owned by founder Sir James Dyson and his family, plans to invest \u00a31bn in battery technology over the next five years. Last year it acquired a University of Michigan spin-off that has developed a new type of battery, which promises to store twice as much energy as today\u2019s liquid-based lithium batteries. Dyson launched 17 new products last year and sold 10m machines, up 25% from 2014. The Dyson 360 Eye robot vacuum cleaner, which uses a panoramic camera lens on top of the machine to map its way around the house, went on sale in Japan for around 138,000 yen (\u00a3850) and will be rolled out in other countries this summer. China became the firm\u2019s fastest-growing major market despite the country\u2019s economic malaise, with revenues up 222% last year. The company has been trading there for three years and is enjoying strong demand for its vacuum cleaners and humidifiers.  Asia Pacific saw volume growth of 70% after big advances in Korea and Taiwan. Japan is the company\u2019s second-biggest market by sales and profits, behind only the US. The country is Dyson\u2019s oldest market \u2013 the first Dyson vacuums were sold there rather than in the UK. The cordless business doubled in Britain and Ireland, where overall sales volumes grew 23%, and in continental Europe, where Dyson became market leader in cordless vacuums and posted 38% growth. More than 90% of its products are sold outside the UK, in 72 countries.  The company said that Europe was a \u201cvery valuable market\u201d but declined to comment about the EU referendum in June. Max Conze, chief executive, said: \u201c2015 was a year of exceptional growth across Asia and Europe, which proves that people across the world want better technology. 2016 is gearing up to be a transformational one as we launch more exciting and more intelligent proprietary technology.\u201d  The company\u2019s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 19% to \u00a3448m in 2015, with revenues up 26% to \u00a31.74bn.  Dyson now employs 7,004 people worldwide, including 2,084 engineers. All of its research and development is done in Malmesbury in Wiltshire, where it wants to double the number of engineers it employs.  The company plans to launch 10 new products in the next few months. After spending \u00a3206m on product development in 2015, it will raise R&amp;D spending to \u00a35m a week this year and has earmarked a further \u00a3100m for external technology investments over the next three years. James Dyson, the founder, said: \u201cBy ramping up our investment in technology and expanding research and development we are developing machines that perform better and disrupt the status quo.

I turned to my companions: \u201cDid that really happen?\u201d I asked.         Listen to the King\u2019s Singers.    Audiences are different around the world A good Italian audience is amazing. Chinese audiences can be a bit restless and have have been known to answer their mobile phones mid-concert, although there are often ushers with laser pens standing in the aisles, poised to stop such behaviour. One of my favourite places to sing is South Korea, but their staple diet of kimchi means you can be knocked back by the potency of the garlic as you walk on stage. \u2026 talking of which, embrace the local cuisine I enjoy eating local fare, but it can surprise.

Good vibrations... countertenor David Hurley.    There are many incredible places on this planet Being part of the group has enabled me to visit so many amazing places around the world. Yellowknife in Canada\u2019s Northwest Territories is fantastic even at -40C. Quito in Ecuador is the highest official capital city in the world, situated at an elevation of 9,350 feet, up in the Andes, and, breathing aside, is a great place to perform. My favourite places are the cities located on great harbours: Hong Kong, Sydney, Stockholm, Auckland, New York, Seattle \u2026 I sit down \u2026 my impulse is to buckle up A while back I took my niece to the cinema to watch the latest Disney film, and, taking my seat, felt automatically for a seatbelt which wasn\u2019t there. But I love the time spent travelling. In the air, I can read, or simply sit and think about things. It never feels like wasted time. Put a delay in the schedule, however, and time stands still. My book becomes boring, and the power on my iPad runs out instantly. I love crosswords and sudoku, and my touring life has been transformed by the iPad editions of the UK newspapers. During sessions for our CD Simple Gifts in the home recording studio of Status Quo\u2019s Francis Rossi, he came in to pick up some guitars. Seeing me doing the crossword, he said he had it sent to him on tour every day. A couple of hours later he returned with his copy of the paper in his hand. \u201cHave you got 12 down yet?\u201d         Listen to the King\u2019s Singers    There is nothing like standing on the stages of the world\u2019s great concert halls The spirits of past performers seem to linger in the air at legendary venues like Carnegie Hall or Sydney Opera House. I love to check out the photo galleries that hang backstage in many venues. The conductor\u2019s dressing room at Warsaw\u2019s Philharmonic hall has photos of Stravinsky, Rubinstein and Shostakovich taken in that same room. \u2026 but there are some words every touring group dreads \u201cI thought I\u2019d take you on the scenic route to the hotel\u201d. Being British we struggle to say \u201cNo, thank you, we\u2019ve just flown 11 hours from London, and we\u2019d like to get to the hotel as soon as possible.\u201d I remember a drive from Chicago\u2019s downtown Hilton to a suburb about 35 miles away. After 90 minutes as we passed by the Hilton for a second time, it became clear that our driver didn\u2019t know where we were going. Eventually I insisted we should stop and buy a map, and, after nearly three hours, we did arrive at our destination. A couple of days later, the same driver failed to show for the pick-up back to Chicago O\u2019Hare airport. Apparently their roommate thought they were looking tired (maybe it was all the driving), and had switched off their alarm clock. You\u2019re not a true King\u2019s Singer until you\u2019ve sung Franz Schubert and Billy Joel in the same concert The usual repertoire for countertenors is renaissance and baroque music, plus a bit of Britten opera and a few modern works. In the King\u2019s Singers I regularly sing romantic music, jazz, folk, pop and loads of contemporary music. Performing and recording some great jazz standards with the legendary George Shearing was one of the thrills of my life, as was singing The Star-Spangled Banner before a Mets baseball game at New York\u2019s Shea Stadium \u2013 surely something few countertenors have done. I love the variety that the King\u2019s Singers has given me, but my heart is with the Renaissance repertoire, especially sacred 16th-century music: Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, William Byrd, Tom\u00e1s Luis da Victoria, Orlandus Lassus. You never know when you\u2019ll meet a King\u2019s Singers fan I once attended a concert at the Tanglewood festival given by Itzhak Perlman and Emanuel Ax. I was taken backstage afterwards to meet both. I was introduced to Mr Perlman, and as I tried to tell him how marvellous his playing was, he declared that when he was relaxing at home with his family he liked nothing better than to order in pizza and play pool, with our Good Vibrations CD the favoured soundtrack. Try to stay on your feet I have only once fallen over mid-concert. It was during the performance of If You\u2019re Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band), a song by the country/bluegrass group Alabama. A great concert finale in the US, it ends with a do-si-do between pairs of King\u2019s Singers. Reaching the front after his last turn, my fellow countertenor released my arm mid-turn, sending me flying.  How Fair Thou Art: Biblical Passions by Palestrina is out this month on Signum Records. They perform at Cadogan Hall, London, on 30 April, David Hurley\u2019s final concert with the King\u2019s Singers will be on 6 August in France.

In their hands, they clutch bags or buckets of kitchen scraps, which they dump into a bin on the truck. From there, the food travels to farms, where it helps ensure a good supply of one of Taiwan\u2019s food staples. Farmers have fed leftover food to livestock for centuries, but Taiwan is one of a handful of countries that have institutionalized the practice. About two thirds of the island nation\u2019s overall food waste, which totaled 610,000 tons last year, goes to help feed the country\u2019s 5.5m pigs \u2013 the top meat source for the country\u2019s 23.5 million people. The practice reduces the amount of garbage that goes to landfills or gets burned, while helping farmers lower their production costs.   Related: The Pig Idea: use food waste as animal feed rather than crops, say celebrity chefs    \u201cWe realized there was a lot of kitchen waste and that if we put it in incinerators it would hamper incineration because it\u2019s wet,\u201d said Chiang Tsu-nong, deputy inspector general with the government\u2019s Bureau of Environmental Inspection. \u201cAnd Taiwan\u2019s land is limited, so if you build a landfill or an incinerator people will protest.\u201d Taiwan\u2019s program reflects the approach by many countries that look at animal feed as a promising channel for diverting food waste, which has become a weighty environmental and policy issue. According to the United Nations, as much as one third of the food produced globally goes to waste; meanwhile, about 795 million people are underfed. Currently, most animal feed is composed of grains \u2013 more than 80% of the soybeans grown globally are used for animal fodder. Uneaten food is cheaper and, some argue, less costly and carbon intensive. A University of Cambridge study published in January shows that feeding food waste to pigs could save 1.8m hectares of farmland worldwide and recycle an estimated 102.5m tons of leftovers produced within the European Union per year. The practice is already common in some Asian countries. Japan, for example, diverts 35% of its food waste to pig farms, preserving some of the leftovers by cooking them at high temperatures and adding lactobacillus, a bacteria used in the production of yogurt. The farms that use this feed can then market their products as eco-friendly pork, which enables them to charge higher prices. Western countries are also struggling with the food waste problem. The US, for example, set its first national goal to reduce food waste last September and hopes to cut its food waste in half by 2030. But recycling leftover food isn\u2019t popular in Western countries. The UK, for example, prohibited the use of animal parts in livestock feed in 1996 after the emergence of mad cow disease, an epidemic that was spread by farmers feeding diseased animal bits to livestock. Similarly, after an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in pigs, the European Union prohibited the use of all food waste except for certain byproducts of food production, such as hops from breweries and whey from dairies. The US has no federal law regulating feeding scraps to pigs, but 22 states have banned the practice.     Taipei residents dump food scraps into waiting garbage trucks. Taiwan is one of a handful of countries that have institutionalized the practice of turning food waste into animal feed. Photograph: Ralph Jennings    A messy beginning For its first four years, Taiwan\u2019s food recycling program struggled due to a lack of compliance and enforcement. Sometimes, pickups were delayed, and residents left piles of waste on curbsides, where they stank up the streets. Some households refused to properly separate their food scraps from other trash, an oversight that rendered their waste unusable. After 2005, enforcement picked up. Workers on garbage trucks began turning away trash that was improperly separated and inspectors began fining homeowners for not separating food waste correctly. Residents have since grown so used to sorting waste and meeting the garbage trucks at the curb at night that some see the trip outside as a chance to socialize with neighbors. Eva Tsai, 51, stores scraps in her refrigerator for two days to avoid stinking up her flat and then makes a garbage truck run at 8.30pm, when a truck stops daily in her neighborhood. She has followed this practice for 15 years. \u201cIt\u2019s not just good for the environment, but a help for Taiwan\u2019s pig farmers,\u201d Tsai said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any trouble at all. You can get know your neighbors and get a little exercise as you go.\u201d   Related: Cutting food waste by a quarter would mean enough for everyone, says UN    Hitting peak pork To use food waste, farmers must order it from the government, pay for it and then cook it at high heat for an hour to kill any viruses. Many of the island\u2019s 7,983 pig farmers also add protein or other nutrients to kitchen waste before feeding their livestock, Chang said. But, as troublesome as the government-produced slop might be, pig farmers who buy it can save about 30% over the cost of commercially produced pig feed. The healthy demand for food waste helps to manage urban waste disposal, noted Chang Sheng-chin, the secretary general of Swine ROC, Taiwan\u2019s association of pig farmers. The food donated to Taiwan\u2019s pigs ultimately comes back to the donors. The country\u2019s $17bn pig farming industry accounts for 16% of its total agricultural output, Chiang said. But despite the appetite for pork \u2013 which makes up about half of all of the meat eaten in Taiwan \u2013 pig farming has declined slightly over the past year because of pressure from pork imports, Chang said. At the same time, Taiwan\u2019s food recycling program is having problems of its own. Waste disposal has become too complex and time consuming for many of Taipei\u2019s citizens, and the amount of recycled waste has essentially plateaued since 2008, Chiang said. Firms hired to handle garbage from apartment buildings have been known to inadequately sort kitchen waste, and garbage truck inspectors aren\u2019t always diligent about checking to make sure the food scraps are mixed with other types of trash. \u201cThe announcements on when you can take trash and to what curbside locations aren\u2019t (always) clear,\u201d said Chang Yu-an, 40, a Taipei dweller and government worker who has taken his family\u2019s kitchen waste to the curb every couple of days for 10 years.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t know where they are, you can end up making idle trips.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/24/indonesia-vows-to-prosecute-chinese-trawler-crew-in-south-china-sea-dispute", "publicationDate": "2016-03-24T02:36:52Z", "tags": ["South China Sea", "Australia news", "China", "Indonesia"], "sentences": ["Related: The Guardian view on the South China Sea: high time for compromise | Editorial    The disputed South China Sea island of Taiping also came under the spotlight on Wednesday after Taiwan gave its first ever international media tour there, less than two months after a visit by its leader, president Ma Ying-jeou, sparked protests from rival claimants.", "Journalists and Taiwan officials disembark at Taiping Island on Wednesday.", "Taiping is the largest island in the Spratlys chain and is administered by Taiwan, which sees it as part of its territory."], "title": "Indonesia vows to prosecute Chinese trawler crew in South China Sea dispute", "article": "Indonesia has refused Chinese demands that it release eight fishermen arrested for illegal fishing, and accused China on Wednesday of sharply raising tensions in the region by helping take back the crew\u2019s seized boat.

Arif Havas Oegroseno, the government official in charge of maritime security, said China\u2019s action had created \u201ca new ball game\u201d that south-east Asian countries needed to follow closely. Oegroseno said China\u2019s claim that it was in traditional fishing grounds was not recognised under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. \u201cIt\u2019s very fake, ambiguous, in terms of since when, since what year does it become historical, traditional?\u201d Oegroseno told reporters on Wednesday. Pandjaitan said Indonesia would beef up its presence in Natuna by deploying more troops and better-equipped patrol boats, and would strengthen the naval base there with a modern defence system.

Journalists and Taiwan officials disembark at Taiping Island on Wednesday. Photograph: EPA    After the tour, Ma insisted on Wednesday it was not provocative. \u201cFilipino lawyers have provided wrong information misleading the world, so we feel we have to come out to rebuff their claims,\u201d he said.  \u201cTo see is to believe,\u201d Ma added. \u201cWe hope journalists can see for themselves that Taiping is an island, not a rock.\u201d China said it too would invite foreign journalists to visit the Spratlys \u201cwhen the time is ripe\u201d, according to foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying. \u201cThe Nansha islands [Spratlys] have always been China\u2019s territory. Chinese people on both sides of the strait have the responsibility to safeguard our heritage,\u201d she said. Taiping is the largest island in the Spratlys chain and is administered by Taiwan, which sees it as part of its territory. But the Spratlys are also claimed in part or whole by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. Earlier in the week, the Indonesian foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, summoned a Chinese diplomat over the trawler dispute and protested that China\u2019s coast guard had \u201cviolated our sovereignty\u201d and called on China to respect international law.   Related: South China Sea: US bomber angers Beijing with Spratly islands flypast    China\u2019s foreign ministry said the incident occurred within traditional Chinese fishing grounds and that the coast guard ship assisted the seized fishing trawler without entering Indonesian territorial waters. It urged Indonesia to immediately release the fishermen. Oegroseno said the collision between the Chinese coast guard vessel and the Kway Fey was an indirect violation of the collision regulation convention published by the International Maritime Organization. Indonesian authorities are concerned an increasingly assertive China might enlarge its territorial claims to include the Natuna islands, which sit between the north-western tip of Indonesia\u2019s Borneo island and the southern tip of Vietnam and consist of about 270 islands that form part of Indonesia\u2019s Riau Islands province, home to 70,000 people. China\u2019s expansive claims to most of the South China Sea have raised tensions with its south-east Asian neighbours, especially as China reclaims land on reefs and builds infrastructure in disputed areas. Indonesia is not involved in the territorial disputes, and Beijing has sought to discourage it from joining other nations in challenging China\u2019s sea claims.

The security laws, which were passed last September after chaotic scenes in parliament, reinterpret the country\u2019s pacifist constitution to enable Japan to exercise collective self-defence \u2013 or coming to the aid of the US and other allies \u2013 in overseas conflicts.   Related: Japan extends military reach in disputed East China Sea    In an online commentary, the state-run Xinhua news agency accused Abe of abandoning Japan\u2019s postwar constitution, which limits the military to a purely defensive role, saying the move would \u201conly serve to endanger the Japanese public\u2019s right to live in peace\u201d. The legislation, the biggest shift in Japan\u2019s defence posture since its wartime defeat in August 1945, would also \u201cpose a severe challenge to peace in the Asia-Pacific region, which is already vulnerable\u201d, the commentary said. Abe\u2019s Liberal Democratic party and its coalition partner pushed the laws through parliament, despite mass protests and warnings that Japanese troops could become embroiled in foreign wars. Abe insists the self-imposed ban on collective self-defence inhibited Japan\u2019s ability to respond to new security threats in the region, including North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme and more assertive Chinese naval activity. Japan and China are embroiled in a longrunning row over ownership of the Senkaku islands in the East China Sea, while Tokyo has voiced support for the Philippines and other countries in their opposition to Beijing\u2019s construction of bases in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Tensions between Beijing and Tokyo rose again this week after Japan switched on a radar station in the East China Sea, giving it a permanent intelligence-gathering post close to Taiwan and the Senkakus, known as the Diaoyu in China.

Photograph: Reuters/Kyodo    The new base on the island of Yonaguni is at the western extreme of a string of Japanese islands in the East China Sea, 150km (90 miles) south of the Senkaku islands. Japan\u2019s increasing sense of caution over Chinese military activity is being reflected in a strategic shift away from its northern maritime border with Russia, despite concerns over possible Russian plans to build a naval base on the disputed Kuril islands. Soviet forces seized the islands from Japan \u2013 where they are known as the Northern Territories \u2013 towards the end of the second world war. Russia\u2019s refusal to return them has prevented the two countries from concluding a permanent peace treaty.  The Xinhua commentary made oblique reference to the South China Sea, where Japan has no direct territorial claims, and accused Abe of pandering to US interests in the region. The point of the security laws, it said, was to \u201cride the coattails of Uncle Sam\u2019s \u2018pivot to Asia\u2019 strategy and pave the way for Japan to further meddle in regional affairs \u2013 not only territorial disputes with its neighbours, but also issues [in] which Japan is not a stakeholder \u2013 with the United States, in a sabre-rattling way\u201d. It added: \u201cAbe\u2019s elaborate ruse to contribute to regional peace and stability has been exposed and once again unmasked Japan as a troublemaker and a pawn of the United States in interfering in Asia-Pacific region affairs.\u201d Abe said the security laws were designed to strengthen Japan\u2019s security alliance with the US, where the Obama administration has welcomed the move. \u201c[We] can now help each other during emergency situations,\u201d Abe told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday. \u201cThe bond of the alliance has been strengthened.\u201d The chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said the laws were \u201cvital to prevent wars and protect people\u2019s lives and livelihoods amid the increasingly severe security environment surrounding our country. \u201cThe government will first preserve the peace through diplomacy and there is no change at all in our policy of proactive diplomacy for that purpose.\u201d Japanese voters are divided over the laws, however. A poll by the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper published on Tuesday showed 47% of respondents did not approve of the changes, while 38% supported them. That compared to 58% who opposed the legislation last September, against 31% who approved."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/mar/29/guardian-weekly-terrorism-optimism-art", "publicationDate": "2016-03-29T14:10:02Z", "tags": [], "sentences": ["In the more feature-focused back of the book, we look at a cycling revival in Taiwan, delve into research suggesting that intelligent people need less socialising, review books on atheism, poverty and pretentiousness, and spend some time with Nature watch in Britain\u2019s Norfolk."], "title": "Inside the 1 April edition", "article": "One week Paris, another Istanbul, another Brussels.

Osaka hopes hi-tech startups will reverse economic woes", "article": "At first glance, Grand Front Osaka in the heart of Japan\u2019s second city looks like any high-end international mall. Fashionistas parade their latest purchases from upscale boutiques, while expensively dishevelled youths cruise endless escalators, coffees in hand. But amid global retailers such as Muji, Panasonic and Zara nestle dozens of shops with less familiar names: Enellege, Au, and Kinki University Fisheries Restaurant. These are not traditional stores but one-off outlets offering exclusive new products and services still under development.  Shoppers can try smartphone apps while they are being coded, sample the latest energy-efficient gadgets, or even sit down to a meal of the world\u2019s first farmed bluefin tuna (a species that has been critically overfished in the wild).  Inside a three-storey space called The Lab are even more experimental prototypes, including drones, holograms and digital shopping assistants. With a wave at a video screen, a virtual silk kimono is overlaid on a floor-to-ceiling image of me, following my every move. If I like it, I can add it to my shopping cart without ever squeezing into a changing room.  It is all part of an ambitious attempt by Osaka to recreate the success of Silicon Valley by harnessing the power of individual consumers as beta testers, not online but in person at plazas and food courts in the city\u2019s newest shopping centre.  Japan\u2019s economic woes are well-known. Its GDP is lower than it was 20 years ago, a quarter of the population is over 65, and the brightest youngsters tend to flee to Tokyo or elsewhere. From 2013 to 2015, Tokyo gained 10 times as many people aged 25 to 34 as Osaka lost.  Technology giants like Sharp \u2013 recently bought by a Taiwan company but still based in Osaka \u2013 that used to rule the world now limp along as \u2018zombie\u2019 firms propped up by government cash. A local journalist even wrote a book warning that the city could end up bankrupt and abandoned, like Detroit. If Osaka\u2019s plan works, today\u2019s initial crop of startups will grow, flourish and lure young workers back to the city to start their own businesses. \u201cStartups are just 8.5% of businesses here but they produce almost 40% of new jobs,\u201d says Masaaki Yoshikawa, director general of the Osaka Innovation Hub, a municipally-funded incubator, quoting data from Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. \u201cAnd yet Japan has three times fewer startups per capita annually than the UK or US.\u201d The Lab will be part of a scheme called Knowledge Capital, designed to help new ideas make it to market faster. It starts in offices above the mall named the Knowledge Salon. This members-only co-working space has hot desks, lounges, and meeting rooms for 275 entrepreneurs, each of whom pays a heavily subsidised fee of just 10,000 Yen (around \u00a360) a month.      People at work in the Knowledge Salon. Photograph: Mark Harris    If a company needs room to grow, it can occupy one of 52 small dedicated offices called Collabo, or even a fully-fledged office suite, all at knock-down rates. There is also a library, accountant and lawyers on site to offer professional advice. The next step is to move to the Lab in the mall downstairs. This is currently home to about a dozen startups and universities in the process of perfecting new products. Because most startups can\u2019t spare the staff for their booths at the Lab, Osaka provides professional \u201ccommunicators\u201d to conduct demonstrations, help users and collect feedback on the products.  \u201cThe startup scene in Osaka is at an early stage,\u201d says Sifang Lu, a 30-something developer who moved back to Japan recently after a spell in Silicon Valley. \u201cBut here, we actually get this help from the city. In San Francisco, they just collect taxes.\u201d  Lu is working on an app called Meet My Dog that allows users to make playdates with other dog owners. \u201cThe key difference between Japan and other countries is that software engineers make very little money here,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re treated like labour.\u201d Despite securing some funding, Lu is not quite ready yet for the ultimate step: a move to one of the two dozen Future Life Showroom storefronts in the mall itself. In fact, none of the startups that began life at Knowledge Capital has yet graduated to a full retail shop, perhaps because the project only began in 2013. In the meantime, the storefronts have been snapped up by established brands like Coca-Cola and Mercedes-Benz happy to find spaces where they can try something new.  One more alternative shop in the showroom is a medicinal herb restaurant run by Rohto, a pharmaceutical company, as part of a vaguely defined \u201cmedical check-up\u201d community project. The restaurant grows many of its own vegetables on site under LED lights. Processing, packaging, transporting, storing and preparing fresh fruit and vegetables uses about four times as much energy of growing them in the first place. Japan\u2019s crowded cities are ideal for experimenting with indoor farming.     Vegetables growing in the Osaka Grand Mall.

Moff is a watch-like wearable toy that automatically adds light sabre or air guitar sound effects to children\u2019s games. It was developed during a city-supported hackathon in Osaka, then funded on Kickstarter in 2014, and is already in the shops. The only problem for Osaka is that as soon as Moff found success, it moved out of the city.  \u201cThe president of Moff took the company and its engineers to Tokyo,\u201d admits Masaaki Yoshikawa. \u201cBut we are targeting becoming a gateway city. In the long run, as Osaka becomes a gateway city with more global connections, we would expect them to come back again.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/04/vietnam-seizes-chinese-vessel-detains-crew", "publicationDate": "2016-04-04T09:10:02Z", "tags": ["South China Sea", "Thailand", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Vietnam"], "sentences": ["In February, China deployed surface-to-air missile launchers on Woody Island, part of the Parcels chain that is also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan, angering both countries."], "title": "Vietnam seizes Chinese vessel in South China Sea", "article": "Vietnam has seized a Chinese ship and detained its captain and two sailors, accusing the crew of illegally intruding on its waters, state media said on Monday.

But archaeological records cannot always distinguish between ritual human sacrifice and any other violent death.  So they focused on what they called the Austronesian cultures, because these have been well-studied, and share a common origin. These cultures spread from an ancestral homeland in Taiwan, across a range of environments from tiny atolls to continents, and evolved into small, egalitarian, family-based cultures and into highly complex political structures, distributed across a vast area, encompassing more than half the world\u2019s longitude and a third of its latitude. Religious beliefs were remarkably diverse, but the practice of human sacrifice \u2013 recorded in 43% of them - was widespread. So were the methods of sacrifice.

But there\u2019s a giant gender imbalance. Out of 80 builders exhibiting at next week\u2019s Bespoked, the UK handmade bicycle show, just two are women.  Why is this? Are men biologically designed to wield a lathe better? Are women really too weedy to cold-set a frame? Or are we just culturally conditioned to think so?  Phil Taylor, the organiser of Bespoked, believes it\u2019s the latter. He says: \u201cI think it\u2019s reflective of society in general. The whole of the engineering world is male-dominated. Until recently there have been few role models for women [frame builders] to aspire to.\u201d  Caren Hartley of Hartley Cycles is one of the female frame-builders showing at Bespoked. She used to make jewellery but switched careers three years ago. What did her friends and family think? \u201cEveryone has been really supportive. My dad loves it because he loves anything mechanical which is probably where I\u2019ve got it from.\u201d  I ask her how physically demanding the work is. \u201cIt\u2019s really active, so you do need to be quite fit,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there is a lot of lifting things around, but it\u2019s not so heavy that you can\u2019t do it, you just have to think about how you lift things more, using your body weight instead of needing to have massive muscles.\u201d  Though for Hartley the active side is a big part of the appeal. \u201cI\u2019ve never had an office job and I can\u2019t imagine ever having one either. I can\u2019t imagine not working with my hands.\u201d  Verity Nichols, Hartley\u2019s assistant, agrees. \u201cIt can be tough, but you gain the strength in no time. Like almost anything technical, it\u2019s all in the practice and the development of your skills, which is loads of fun - getting physically better at crafting the object you\u2019ve designed in your imagination.\u201d  I ask Nichols why she thinks there are so few women in the job. \u201cThere\u2019s still a strange sense that women aren\u2019t meant to get their hands dirty. Young girls aren\u2019t encouraged to pick up a hammer or make something with their hands and it contributes to a feeling that a workshop is not a place for them.\u201d  Liz Colebrook of Beaumont Bicycle is the other female frame builder exhibiting at Bespoked. She found the lack of role models a pain growing up. \u201cAt school in the 1970s I was not allowed to study tech drawing, woodwork or metalwork,\u201d shesays. \u201cNow the door is opening but it\u2019s still a tough path, as there are very few inspiring female engineers in schools. When I was growing up the only mainstream female technically literate role model for me on TV was Judith Hann from Tomorrow\u2019s World!\u201d  She also wonders if it might be \u201cslightly uncomfortable for men to see a woman weld well.\u201d She says: \u201cThis is supposed to be what men are good at. It\u2019s technical and it\u2019s tricky, it\u2019s dangerous and it\u2019s safety critical. It\u2019s a bit like people\u2019s attitude to women pilots. But the proof is in our order books and in our builds.\u201d  Colebrook tells me she loves her job. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge.

Or else we are going to be met with - I told you it was too hard \u2026 which is not fair because every pioneer makes mistakes.\u201d  To help customers take her seriously, Colebrook will have two large photographs of her welding and holding tools at Bespoked. She says: \u201cIt\u2019s so important to actually see a woman braze, to see her holding the torch, because when did you last see a woman welding? Okay, Irene Cara in Flashdance but was she actually welding? I wanted to build frames over 25 years ago but I didn\u2019t actually believe that I would ever do this.\u201d  Isla Rowntree, the founder of Isla Bikes, was a huge influence on Liz Colebrook. \u201cIn redefining the child\u2019s bike she has taken nearly every component and redesigned it - not just the frame. Her knowledge is immense and she has certainly played a significant part in my belief in being able to fit, design and build a complete bicycle from scratch.\u201d  Being mentored by Hartley has been hugely important to Nichols. She says: \u201cApproaching frame building as you would an old-school apprenticeship has been a very rewarding experience for me.\u201d  Could the government do more to help women in manufacturing? Hartley says: \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to find grants but I haven\u2019t been able to find anything so I think they probably could do a bit more.\u201d  I ask Phil Taylor why someone might want a bike from Liz Colebrook or Caren Hartley. \u201cBecause they are excellent frame-builders, and when thinking about who has made your bike it\u2019s important to look at predominantly what styles of bike the frame builder specialises in,\u201d he says. \u201cIf a woman wants a bike made especially for her, who\u2019s going to best understand what a woman wants in a bike? A female framebuilder. Of course that\u2019s not to say a man couldn\u2019t build a great bike for a woman.\u201d  Are women more likely to buy bikes from a female frame builder? Colebrook says: \u201cOn average I have two women customers for every male customer. I sense women are hugely supportive.\u201d  Hartley hand polishes her frames and hand-cuts the silver head badges at the front of her bikes, using skills learnt from her time making jewellery. She also specialises in small frames for women, though many of her customers are still men \u201cbecause more men ride bespoke bikes.\u201d  Bike-frame building is a labour of love rather than a quick route to riches. \u201cHand-making stuff takes a long time and it\u2019s difficult to charge adequately for your time. Someone could make a whole bike in Taiwan for less money than the raw materials for a bike would cost me,\u201d says Hartley.  But Nichols says: \u201cI think it\u2019s nice to know where your bike came from, that it\u2019s made locally and by hand, there\u2019s a story behind it and a definitive start point to your journey with this object.\u201d  \u2022 Bespoked, the UK\u2019s handmade bicycle show, takes place at Brunel\u2019s Old Station in Bristol next week from 15-17 April   "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/19/story-of-cities-25-shannon-ireland-china-economic-boom", "publicationDate": "2016-04-19T06:30:16Z", "tags": ["Cities", "Economic policy", "Global economy", "Ireland", "Business", "Economics", "Europe", "China", "World news"], "sentences": ["Photograph: Courtesy of Shannon Group Plc    As early as the 60s and 70s, advisers from Shannon worked on projects for free zones in Taiwan, Malaysia, Egypt and Sri Lanka."], "title": "Story of cities #25: Shannon \u2013 a tiny Irish town inspires China\u2019s economic boom", "article": "When Wen Jiabao visited the small Irish town of Shannon in 2005, it was like a religious pilgrimage for the then Chinese premier and arguably the world\u2019s second most powerful man. He was the latest in a long line of high-level Chinese dignitaries to come and pay their respects to the site on the west coast of Ireland where they believe China\u2019s rise to superpower status really began. In the buildup to the visit, the Chinese ambassador had told his Irish hosts that they wanted time to allow Wen to pause for reflection on the \u201cplateau\u201d \u2013 a spot on Tullyglass Hill that overlooks a grey, windswept, industrial estate. \u201cTo us it was just this nondescript place on the top of a hill, but for the Chinese, they wanted to see where it all started,\u201d said Kevin Thompstone, president of the Shannon Chamber of Commerce, pausing at the memory of this incongruous spectacle. \u201cThis was the leader of China, a country with a population of 1.3 billion!\u201d Shannon is a tiny town with a population of just 9,673 in the middle of rural County Clare. But it is famous in the history of economic development, widely considered the site of the first modern \u201cspecial economic zone\u201d (SEZ). The industrial estate that Wen would have gazed upon that day is the Shannon Free Zone \u2014 a 2.5 sq km stretch of land that was carved out and given to foreign investors in the late 1950s, an audacious attempt to attract investment in exchange for tax holidays, tariff reductions and other incentives.     Chinese vice president Xi Jinping visits Shannon in 2012. Photograph: Peter Muhly/AFP/Getty Images    Today there are thousands of these zones around the world, the best-known of which are in China where they are credited with helping fuel the country\u2019s dramatic economic boom over the past quarter century. The zones have attracted millions of people from around China looking for work and in the process created hundreds of new cities. Shenzhen, the country\u2019s first SEZ, which opened in 1980, currently harbours 300,000 migrant workers, while Pearl River Delta Economic Zone is home to 42 million people. These areas have been integral to China\u2019s rapid urbanisation in recent decades. \u201cObviously they took it to a much bigger scale than anything that we did,\u201d said Thompstone. \u201cThe Chinese were able to develop and grow on the back of this model from this little place called Shannon \u2026 and there\u2019s something in their spirit that says, \u2018You know those people who went before us, where did it start? Where did it come from?\u2019\u201d The story goes back to the 1940s, when most of the first transatlantic flights would arrive in Europe and refuel at Shannon airport, before continuing on to their final destinations. But within decades aerospace technology had improved and planes were able to fly longer distances. With the increasing use of jet engines in civilian aircraft, there was no longer any need to stop in Shannon, and the town faced economic collapse. Enter one of the region\u2019s most celebrated innovators \u2013 the man who, in Shannon\u2019s origin myth, is the town\u2019s Founding Father. Everyone who has lived here long enough has their own anecdote about Brendan O\u2019Regan, whose initials BOR have, in Shannon, come to mean \u201cBash On Regardless\u201d. \u201cHe was a great person to motivate other people,\u201d said Tom Kelleher, an economist who worked with O\u2019Regan in the late 60s and 70s. \u201cAnything was considered, no matter how outlandish.\u201d A former caterer, O\u2019Regan had a long string of innovations behind him, including the establishment of the world\u2019s first duty free shop at the Shannon airport in 1947 after the Irish parliament passed a new law, the Customs Free Act, which exempted transit and embarking passengers, goods and aircraft from normal customs procedures. Faced with the prospect that planes would now fly over the town, O\u2019Regan famously argued that Shannon would have to \u201cpull the airplanes out of the sky\u201d. His proposal for doing this was to create a small zone just outside the airport where foreign investors could be free of onerous regulations and taxation from the central government in Dublin. The Shannon Free Zone offered companies tax breaks and exemptions on value-added tax on imported goods and goods used for the production of exports. Corporate taxes were also cut. Grants were offered to companies to support research and development in the zone. Over the years, companies including Zimmer, and subsidiaries of DeBeers, GE, Intel and Lufthansa set up shop there. Despite this influx, the population of Shannon never ballooned as it has in other SEZs around the world, as many skilled workers ended up commuting from nearby cities such as Limerick and Galway.

The airport \u2013 which, thanks to the Free Zone and the traffic that it brought, did not end up closing \u2013 added a touch of glamour, too. \u201cWe thought we were in the middle of the world!\u201d says Mary. \u201cFlights coming in from New York and Boston \u2026 I remember when President Kennedy came through, oh my God, the whole country stopped. Thousands of people went to the airport, it was amazing.\u201d She chuckles. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t quite the same when Ronald Reagan came.\u201d Other dignitaries to have come through Shannon over the years include Fidel Castro and Barack Obama.    US troops are coming through Shannon on planes, carrying weapons. Ireland is prostituting itself  Edward Horgan, activist     Paul Ryan, an economic consultant who grew up in the town, describes Shannon as \u201cIreland\u2019s first new town in 300 years \u2026 built from scratch and very much Milton Keynes-esque, The 1960s approach of, \u2018Let\u2019s turn it around, make the back of the house the front,\u2019 all of these green areas, common areas \u2013 it was all very much in that style.\u201d Today SEZs are found worldwide, from Argentina to Cambodia. But in 1959 the idea was revolutionary. O\u2019Regan entered history as the man who created this model \u2013 which would eventually be a major policy prescription recommended to poor countries by the World Bank. Many of the world\u2019s SEZs have been set up with advice from consultants from Shannon. Ryan, who works for a firm called Shannon International Development Consultants (SIDC), says the attraction of these zones is the possibility of testing policies out in a small area, before rolling them out nationwide. \u201cLet\u2019s say you want to try something, in a developing country, and you want to introduce new ways of doing business \u2026 having a zone, having an area that is ringfenced and set aside from the rest of the economy, where you can try new approaches, is part of what makes it work,\u201d he said. One of the keys to Shannon\u2019s success, says Ryan, was the construction of a second zone. Smithstown, an industrial estate next to the free zone, was developed as a satellite location for mainly Irish businesses who became sub-suppliers to the larger businesses. \u201cYou have to provide the Smithstown, you have to provide that indigenous industry starting point,\u201d he said. Otherwise, local businesses and the local economy might not benefit much from having an SEZ in the area.     Jiang Zemin (front row, third from right) pictured on his visit to Shannon in 1980. Photograph: Courtesy of Shannon Group Plc    As early as the 60s and 70s, advisers from Shannon worked on projects for free zones in Taiwan, Malaysia, Egypt and Sri Lanka. Training courses on how to develop free zones were also organised in Shannon, attended by representatives from dozens of countries. Jiang Zemin, who would later become China\u2019s president, visited as a junior customs official in 1980 and took a three-week training programme on how to set up an industrial free zone. At that time, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was experimenting with opening up the country\u2019s economy and the idea of \u201ctesting\u201d reforms in specific areas was appealing. The Shenzhen SEZ \u2013 China\u2019s first \u2013 opened the same year Zemin returned from Shannon. But according to some, Shannon\u2019s status as the first modern SEZ is just a convenient narrative for those who favour its expansion across the world. Patrick Neveling, a social scientist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, argues that the first SEZ in modern times was actually established more than a decade earlier than Shannon\u2019s, in Puerto Rico in 1947. But its status as a de facto American colony might have made the model look like an imperial imposition. \u201cIn the 1950s or 60s it was advisable to have Ireland \u2013 a country that can portray itself as a victim of English imperialism \u2013 come up with this concept, or to make it look like they came up with it,\u201d says Neveling. \u201cThey were not a non-aligned country, but they were a nation that was supposedly outside of the western world \u2013 they were the poorhouse of Europe and so forth. This way you could sell this SEZ model to the rest of the world as a kind of postcolonial endeavour, whereas in Puerto Rico of course it looks very much like a colonial endeavour.\u201d The World Bank and other multilateral organisations that promote the establishment of SEZs also use examples of historical \u201cfree zones\u201d in Roman antiquity as a different way of making this model seem natural, Neveling suggests. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying: \u2018Ever since we exited the Stone Age we\u2019ve done this.\u2019\u201d At a crossroads Walking around Shannon today, it is hard to square the town\u2019s disproportionate international influence \u2013 symbolic or otherwise \u2013 with its tiny size. Ryan suggests that Shannon stayed small precisely because of its success in attracting foreign investment to Ireland. \u201cShannon grew to a certain point, and then what worked in the free zone could be applied to the rest of the country. So you could spread that economic development to other towns and cities, and the need to have Shannon, this controlled area, went away. But Shannon continued to be an excellent brand \u2013 even today it is a big name.\u201d     Since 2001, the use of Shannon airport by the US military been the subject of protest from antiwar campaigners. Photograph: Niall Carson/PA    Since 2005 the Free Zone has had the same 12.5% corporate tax rate as the rest of Ireland. Now most businesses in the zone are in services, not manufacturing. Incentives on offer to companies in the zone are on the whole no different to those offered in the rest of the Irish economy. EU state aid rules have also made it illegal in most cases to carve out specific territories and afford them special laws or exemptions to regulations. \u201cThe nature of the business has changed and over time the fence that was around the zone, and the custom control points, they disappeared,\u201d says Thompstone at the Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThey were originally set up because of the 0% tax rate, that then was extended to other parts of the country \u2026 then we joined the EU in 1973 and the free zone regime no longer fitted with that, but even at that point we didn\u2019t need it anymore. So the fences came down and the benefits of a free trade zone were no longer so relevant because most of the exports were going to the EU, which was duty-free anyway. Really, today the Shannon Free Trade Zone name that you see on the entrance, is there more for marketing.\u201d There is another dynamic that has put Shannon in the headlines in recent years. Since 2001 the Irish government has let the US use Shannon airport for its military planes, and an estimated 2.5 million US troops have since passed through. An activist group called Shannonwatch has formed, which campaigns against \u201cthe use of Shannon airport by the US military on their way to and from their wars in Afghanistan and Iraq\u201d. Edward Horgan, a long-time activist with Shannonwatch, walks with us to the gates of the airport. \u201cThat\u2019s one right there,\u201d he says blithely, peering through binoculars at a plane across the runway. \u201cThe bulk of troops would have passed through on chartered civilian aircraft [but] we do know that those troops are carrying those weapons with them on the planes.\u201d Among the planes to have gone through Shannon is the Lockheed C-130 Hercules military aircraft, which can come in various configurations, including weaponised versions.     A US Hercules Transporter military aircraft parked at Shannon airport. Photograph: John Cogill/AP    For Horgan, Ireland\u2019s loan of Shannon airport to US warplanes is a violation of Irish neutrality, as stated in Article 28.3 of the country\u2019s constitution. It is also similar to the Free Zone and Shannon\u2019s history of welcoming foreign corporations to set up shop tax-free. \u201cIreland is prostituting itself,\u201d he says. In 2016, Shannon seems once again to be at a crossroads. In a world of trade liberalisation and the proliferation of tax havens, there is very little states can now offer private capital that differentiates them and makes them a better candidate for investment.    Related: Story of cities #26: Delhi's modernist dream proves a far-fetched fantasy    \u201cIn the modern EU environment there is very little differentiation that we can achieve as a general purpose free zone, so that isn\u2019t going to cut it,\u201d says Patrick Edmonds, Shannon Group\u2019s strategy director and the man tasked with devising the future model. \u201cIreland is already an attractive location for [foreign direct investment] for national-level reasons. So how do we actually differentiate Shannon?\u201d The Shannon Group\u2019s brass will need all their creativity to come up with workable proposals to this dilemma. In many respects, Shannon seems like a microcosm of world history, touched in strange and unlikely ways by the grand currents that have driven global events since the end of the second world war. From the industrial free zone innovation that would spur China\u2019s rise to power in the 21st century to becoming part of the infrastructure in US conflicts in the Middle East, Shannon has been involved in some way. But attracting the coveted hot money \u2013 a preoccupation for policymakers around the world \u2013 means Shannon needs a new O\u2019Regan more than ever. Can plucky Shannon innovate its way out of this one?

They also point to her involvement, between 1999 and 2005, with Computer Associates-Jinchen, a joint venture between an American tech company and a Chinese firm in which China\u2019s ministry of public security reportedly held a 20% stake.

Because of her computer science degree, Kathy was assigned as a junior engineer at the People\u2019s Liberation Army. \u201cWhen the Chinese economy further opened up with reform in the early 1990s, Kathy chose to pursue her passion for a technology career by switching to the private sector in 1994.\u201d China\u2019s government-controlled media also came to Chen\u2019s defense.

The International Banana Congress was shifted to Miami at the last minute from Costa Rica, following concerns that attendees would spread the disease, known as \u201cPanama disease\u201d or \u201cFusarium wilt\u201d, to the region via contaminated soil on their shoes. The fungal disease has already decimated banana crops in south-east Asia, virtually wiping out Indonesia\u2019s banana exports and causing misery for growers in the Philippines, China, the Middle East and parts of Africa. Fusarium wilt was first seen in Australia and Taiwan and is spread via soil, water and contaminated farm equipment. About 1,000 delegates at the International Banana Congress are desperately attempting to craft a plan to both stop the spread of the disease and also find a replacement type of banana that won\u2019t be susceptible to the fungus. Should the disease affect banana crops in South America, the $36bn banana industry could be faced with escalating prices and many smaller operators going out of business. Demand for the produce remains strong: Americans eat bananas almost as much as apples and oranges combined.  Fazil Dusunceli, an expert at the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization, said there was little confidence the disease could be stopped before it reaches Latin America, which has caused \u201cincreased worry and panic\u201d among growers of the popular yellow fruit. \u201cThough spread may not be immediate it would cause greater concern among the major banana producing and exporting countries,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIn fact, the problem is when it is noticed, it may be already too late to effectively stop it from spreading, as the disease may have spread further. \u201cAlthough not yet detected in Latin America it is considered as a major concern because once the disease gets into a plantation, it is not possible to eradicate it fully and very difficult to stop its spread. Thus its prevention is key for its control and countries need to be watchful and prepared.\u201d Fusarium wilt is the biggest crisis facing the banana industry since a different strain of fungus wiped out crops across Latin America in the first half of the last century. Banana splits can only be enjoyed worldwide today due to a decision to switch from the Gros Michel banana \u2013 then the industry favorite \u2013 to the Cavendish. Although less tasty than the luxuriant Gros Michel, the Cavendish was resistant to the fungus. Unfortunately the Cavendish, which now represents 99% of the banana market, is falling victim to the latest fungal outbreak, causing furrowed brows among banana researchers who have toiled for years to find a suitable replacement.  Hope lies in a promising contender known rather coldly as GCTCV-219, devised by the Taiwan Banana Research Institute. Taiwanese banana scientists claim the new genre has a shape and taste similar to the ailing Cavendish. However, Dusunceli has a note of caution for banana enthusiasts. \u201cAlthough many institutions are working on development of resistant varieties and there are some promising developments in this regard, as for now there is no confirmed variety fully resistant to the disease and adaptive to different conditions for wide-scale use,\u201d he said. While the global supply is unlikely to come under any short-term pressure, the banana industry is using the conference to ensure there are no further complications in the development of their prized crop. \u201cWe have to work together, united, to find progress on this,\u201d said Jorge Sauma, chief executive of Costa Rica\u2019s National Banana Corporation. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to predict the future of the Cavendish. If you do all the measures together and work together, it\u2019s possible to stop the disease. It\u2019s difficult to tell the future but we are positive. We have the best brains from five continents here to work this out.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/21/us-tech-industry-government-ties-white-house-twitter-uber-china-kathy-chen", "publicationDate": "2016-04-21T18:47:04Z", "tags": ["Twitter", "China", "Technology", "Silicon Valley", "Obama administration", "US politics", "US political lobbying", "US news"], "sentences": ["Twitter found itself confronting that question this week after it hired Kathy Chen, a former engineer for the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), to head up ad sales and business development in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan."], "title": "From Uber to Eric Schmidt, tech is closer to the US government than you'd think", "article": "What\u2019s worse for a Silicon Valley executive: ties to the Chinese military or friends in the US Defense Department? Twitter found itself confronting that question this week after it hired Kathy Chen, a former engineer for the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), to head up ad sales and business development in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Internet freedom activists and Chinese dissidents, who have to skirt Beijing\u2019s digital censors to use Twitter, said it was a betrayal.  The spat illustrates the delicate balancing act technology companies face as they are forced to expand overseas to grow. In the US, Silicon Valley, like any industry, has embraced and relied on close relationships with former government officials both for technical talent and to help grease the wheels as they confront regulatory issues.  Alphabet\u2019s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, recently joined a Department of Defense advisory panel. Facebook recently hired a former director at the US military\u2019s research lab, Darpa. Uber employs Barack Obama\u2019s former campaign manager David Plouffe and Amazon.com tapped his former spokesman Jay Carney. Google, Facebook, Uber and Apple collectively employ a couple of dozen former analysts for America\u2019s spy agencies, who openly list their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s on LinkedIn.  These connections are neither new nor secret. But the fact they are so accepted illustrates how tech\u2019s leaders \u2013 even amid current fights over encryption and surveillance \u2013 are still seen as mostly US firms that back up American values.  As Twitter seeks to sell more ads in China, Google ponders re-entering the market and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg makes visits to Beijing, that may change.  \u201cIf I\u2019m at Twitter, it\u2019s a smart, strategic move,\u201d said Shawn Powers, author of The Real Cyber War: The Political Economy of Internet Freedom. \u201cIf I\u2019m a policy maker for the US government, I would be concerned.\u201d Powers said it wasn\u2019t clear if the reaction against Chen\u2019s hire was based in nationalism or the fact that China is less transparent about how government and companies interact. \u201cThere are very specific suspicions about China\u2019s role in the world,\u201d he said. Twitter has defended hiring Chen and says the executive has never been a member of the communist party, though acknowledges her PLA connections.  Confusingly, Twitter \u2013 along with Facebook, Google and other American tech firms \u2013 is technically banned in China but still has users who employ \u201cvirtual private networks\u201d to get around China\u2019s censors. The block also doesn\u2019t stop the company from selling to Chinese advertisers, who want customers outside the country or to target the Chinese users who still find a way to use the service. Company executives said her role is not related to Twitter posts but instead business with Chinese firms, some of which run ads on the service. And in China, where the lines between the private and public sector are more blurred than in the US, having someone who knows how the system works could be useful.  Christopher Soghoian, a technologist with the American Civil Liberties Union, said low-level employees\u2019 government connections matter less than leading executives\u2019 ties to government.  For instance, at least a dozen Google engineers have worked at the NSA, according to publicly available records on LinkedIn. And, this being Silicon Valley, not everyone who worked for a spy agency advertises that on LinkedIn. Soghoian, a vocal critic of mass surveillance, said Google hiring an ex-hacker for the NSA to work on security doesn\u2019t really bother him. \u201cBut Eric Schmidt having a close relationship with the White House does,\u201d he said.  In March, the Defense Department announced Schmidt, executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, would head a board to help the defense secretary, Ashton Carter, navigate new technology. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In January, executives from several technology firms, including Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg, met with US national security officials to see if there were ways they could better help the government counter Islamic extremism on their social networks.  And, to be sure, while Chen\u2019s role at Twitter may be business-related, she still appears to recognize the power of a technology company to promote a country\u2019s interest.  In reply to a tweet from CCTV, China\u2019s state television service, announcing her new job, Chen replied:    @cctvnews @jack let&#39;s work together to tell great China story to the world!&mdash; Kathy Chen (@kathychen2016) April 15, 2016  "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/22/japanese-cat-cafe-closed-down-over-neglect-fears", "publicationDate": "2016-04-22T05:04:46Z", "tags": ["Japan", "Cats", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["\u201cIt will depend on whether they improve.\u201d Taiwan opened the world\u2019s first cat cafe in 1998 and Japan followed suit in 2004."], "title": "Japanese cat cafe closed down over neglect fears", "article": "One of Japan\u2019s famed cat cafes has been closed down for violating animal cruelty laws in the first crackdown of its kind.   Related: Cat caf\u00e9s and doggy dining rooms    The cafes, where customers pay a premium to drink coffee and stroke cats in spaces normally not much bigger than a living room, have become hugely popular since springing up more than a decade ago. But The Cat\u2019s Paw cafe in Tokyo\u2019s Sumida district has fallen foul of the city authorities amid concern about neglect for the animals. City authorities said the cafe had to close for a month for violating the animal welfare act. The 30sq metre cafe was home to 62 cats, many of them elderly and in bad health. In the cramped conditions, illness allegedly spread among the cats, leading customers to report the cafe for animal cruelty. It is the first time that authorities have closed down a cafe for neglecting animals but an official said the city would not hesitate to close down other cafes if they were found to be neglecting animals. \u201cThe cafe breached animal welfare laws, so we took action,\u201d Yachiyo Kurihara of the Tokyo Animal Welfare Centre told The Guardian. \u201cWe warned the cafe in January and told them how to treat their cats better, but the neglect continued.\u201d Kurihara said that it was uncertain whether the cafe would open again. \u201cIt will depend on whether they improve.\u201d Taiwan opened the world\u2019s first cat cafe in 1998 and Japan followed suit in 2004. Since then, the number of animal cafes has proliferated in Japan, where many people live in apartment buildings that forbid pets. Customers can go to different cafes to pet animals as diverse as hedgehogs, horses, rabbits and owls today. There are around 150 cat cafes in the country. Kurihara says that all animal cafes have to register with the government and comply with welfare laws. Cafes not doing so, she said, would also be inspected, instructed on how to treat their animals better and closed if they failed to comply. \u201cIf people see something wrong in a cafe they visit, we urge them to contact us.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/23/cloud-gate-taiwan-dance-song-wanderers", "publicationDate": "2016-04-23T06:00:29Z", "tags": ["Dance", "Stage", "Taiwan", "Culture", "Art and design"], "sentences": ["The Cloud Gate Dance Theatre of Taiwan arrives at Sadler\u2019s Wells next month to give one of the last performances of its signature work.", "The stage gradually fills with over three tonnes of golden coloured grains \u2013 especially shipped in from Taiwan \u2013 which form into deep drifts to become the mountains, rivers and desert through which dancers slowly enact the rituals of pilgrimage.", "For decades following the end of China\u2019s civil war in 1949 the Taiwanese regime led by Chiang Kai-shek had claimed to be the legitimate government of all China, but international recognition gradually eroded and in 1971 it was expelled from the United Nations.", "In one respect the mission of the company was to explore what it is to be Taiwanese, as we knew so little about our own home.\u201d     Wang Rong-yu in the part of the Monk in Songs of the Wanderers.", "Photograph: Yu Hui-hung    At the company\u2019s new theatre, which opened last year on the outskirts of the capital Taipei, Lin gestures in the direction of the Chinese mainland, 110 miles across the Taiwan Straits.", "Well into the 80s Taiwanese children were taught about Beijing and the Great Wall and how long the Yangtze was.", "But, says Lin, \u201cwe had no idea about the rivers in Taiwan.", "Today you can go to a store and buy half a dozen books on the butterflies of Taiwan, but back then we had to explore for ourselves.", "This is not work projected out at an audience, it is work that draws an audience in.\u201d Cloud Gate occupies a unique space in Taiwanese culture and society.", "Lin was born in Taiwan in 1947, the eldest of five children of Taiwanese parents who had been educated in Tokyo during Japanese control of the island.", "When he eventually returned to Taiwan he taught creative writing and journalism and published several novels.", "When he returned to Taiwan in 1971 he met some young dancers, who wanted him to teach them.", "Photograph: Alamy    The 24 dancers of the company have all come through the Taiwanese system that provides dance classes alongside regular schooling.", "And the dancers are connected to the society because it is made up of their cousins and neighbours and parents, even when we are performing in the country to farmers and melon sellers.\u201d These outdoor performances have also had a wider impact on Taiwanese life.", "\u201cHe is so beautiful to look at, but I don\u2019t want to torture him any more, so the work will be performed for one more season in Taiwan and then retired.\u201d Lin says that he intends to retire too."], "title": "Cloud Gate: making dance out of martial arts and meditation", "article": "The Cloud Gate Dance Theatre of Taiwan arrives at Sadler\u2019s Wells next month to give one of the last performances of its signature work. Songs of the Wanderers opens with the solitary, still figure of a Buddhist monk standing under a spotlit stream of falling rice. The stage gradually fills with over three tonnes of golden coloured grains \u2013 especially shipped in from Taiwan \u2013 which form into deep drifts to become the mountains, rivers and desert through which dancers slowly enact the rituals of pilgrimage. Although it draws on Buddhism, the imagery also encompasses more universal readings and the performance is accompanied by the rhythmic chantings of a Georgian choir. So it is intriguing to learn that this work, depicting a timeless spiritual quest for \u201casceticism and quietude\u201d, is a characteristic offering from a company that emerged from one of the most turbulent periods of modern Asian geopolitics. For decades following the end of China\u2019s civil war in 1949 the Taiwanese regime led by Chiang Kai-shek had claimed to be the legitimate government of all China, but international recognition gradually eroded and in 1971 it was expelled from the United Nations. Cloud Gate founder Lin Hwai-min was studying in the United States at the time and found himself returning home to an island in which a whole generation were suddenly trying to discover who they were. \u201cThere was a lot of energy in literature and the visual arts,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I set up Cloud Gate [named after an ancient Chinese dance] we were the first professional dance company. We felt part of a movement in search of its roots. In one respect the mission of the company was to explore what it is to be Taiwanese, as we knew so little about our own home.\u201d     Wang Rong-yu in the part of the Monk in Songs of the Wanderers. Photograph: Yu Hui-hung    At the company\u2019s new theatre, which opened last year on the outskirts of the capital Taipei, Lin gestures in the direction of the Chinese mainland, 110 miles across the Taiwan Straits. \u201cWhat was important was over there\u201d, he says. Well into the 80s Taiwanese children were taught about Beijing and the Great Wall and how long the Yangtze was. But, says Lin, \u201cwe had no idea about the rivers in Taiwan. It just wasn\u2019t in the textbooks. Today you can go to a store and buy half a dozen books on the butterflies of Taiwan, but back then we had to explore for ourselves. City people travelled to the country to see the landscape, the farms, the rituals being carried out in front of the temples.\u201d Lin\u2019s response was to develop a form of modern dance that, while open to western and other influences, was intrinsically indigenous in its movements and imagery. He notes the same comparisons between boxing and martial arts as between classical ballet and the work he wanted to produce. \u201cIn both boxing and ballet you\u2019re tense all the time. In our dance, and in martial arts, you are relaxed in preparation for moments of great intensity. You make a gesture and then you subside again like a wave. And we don\u2019t try to elevate and defy gravity. We submit to gravity and attempt to find a harmony with the earth. When we tour abroad the reaction is always the same for new western audiences. For five minutes they are a little confused and fidgety, and then they find the rhythm and become still themselves. This is not work projected out at an audience, it is work that draws an audience in.\u201d Cloud Gate occupies a unique space in Taiwanese culture and society. Its open-air summer shows attract audiences of up to 40,000 people. Its logo has appeared on the livery of China Airlines as well as on Taipei metro trains and buses. Lin, universally known as Mr Lin, has national treasure status and on the streets of Taipei is repeatedly stopped by people simply wanting to say \u201cthank you\u201d to him. He says he has become used to the attention and is proud that his work evokes such public warmth. But even he was taken aback when, as we talk at a secluded restaurant in the hills above Taipei, a fellow diner came over to his table to offer three days\u2019 free treatment at a Shanghai hospital, if Mr Lin ever needed it. Lin was born in Taiwan in 1947, the eldest of five children of Taiwanese parents who had been educated in Tokyo during Japanese control of the island. \u201cWe were brought up basically as Japanese kids with quite severe discipline,\u201d he recalls. \u201cMy parents spoke Japanese. We knelt on tatami. I was a mixture to begin with. A multicultural bastard.\u201d His parents brought western, Japanese and Chinese culture into the home. They had pictures of Goethe and Beethoven on the wall and he enjoyed Japanese tales, songs and Samurai films. By his teens Lin was also into Ernest Hemingway, F Scott Fitzgerald and Jackson Pollock. \u201cWe were from a village in the south, and although a gentry family we were familiar with the land and rice paddies. That was a part of me too.\u201d    There was a hunger for dance. Whether we drew on folk tales or history, it was all part of our aud\u00adience\u2019s lives    Despite this interest in the arts, it was always assumed Lin would go into a profession and he duly studied law at university. But within a year he had switched to journalism, for which he felt better suited having been contributing to magazines since the age of 14. \u201cI always had more pocket money than other kids to buy books or go to movies.\u201d He then went to study in America and won a scholarship to the renowned writers\u2019 workshop in Iowa. When he eventually returned to Taiwan he taught creative writing and journalism and published several novels. But more significantly, it was in America that Lin began a serious engagement with dance. His interest was first sparked at the age of five, when he saw the Powell and Pressburger film version of Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s tale about a ballerina, The Red Shoes, on TV. (Matthew Bourne has just announced that he will be choreographing a new stage version of the story this year). In America Lin began to take modern dance classes, including at the Martha Graham school in New York. When he returned to Taiwan in 1971 he met some young dancers, who wanted him to teach them. \u201cThen of course they wanted to perform, and so in 1973 Cloud Gate began. We had to pay for so many things I was on the verge of a breakdown after the first season,\u201d he says. \u201cBut fortunately we were young and stupid. If we had been sophisticated and calculating we never would have started.\u201d The company caught the public imagination from the outset, selling out its first two performances in a 3,000 seat venue. \u201cThere was a hunger for dance and we connected with people by doing our own thing. This wasn\u2019t Swan Lake. Whether we drew on folk tales or history or calligraphy, it was all recognisably part of our audience\u2019s lives.\u201d Lin prided himself on being a \u201cgarbage can of a choreographer\u201d, picking things up from India, Europe and elsewhere in Asia as well as from home. \u201cAnd we were isolated here and that was wonderful. In New York or London there are giants with long shadows. Here I just had to dig to find the things around me.\u201d Over the years he has instigated innovative forms of training and preparation for his dancers. Songs of the Wanderers, which was first performed 22 years ago, came out of a trip Lin took to Bodh Gaya in India, the place where the Buddha attained his enlightenment. Although Lin had been brought up as a Buddhist, the journey, and the realisation that Buddha \u201cwas not a god, he was a simple human being who had great compassion and that is why he figured out this philosophy about life\u201d, had a profound impact on Lin\u2019s life and work. He had already asked his dancers to work in rice fields to prepare for roles and now he suggested meditation. \u201cWe went on to use martial arts, and qigong, an ancient breathing exercise, in our daily training. At first the dancers hated it. They wanted to do pirouettes and jumps. But I asked them to just stand there and drop their eyes and eventually we came up with the work.\u201d     Cloud Gate founder Lin Hwai-min. Photograph: Alamy    The 24 dancers of the company have all come through the Taiwanese system that provides dance classes alongside regular schooling. \u201cFrom the very beginning we didn\u2019t want performances to be monopolised by the elite,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe great majority of our dancers are ordinary kids. Our performances \u2013 particularly the big outdoor performances around the country \u2013 are a gift and an endorsement and an expectation from the public. And the dancers are connected to the society because it is made up of their cousins and neighbours and parents, even when we are performing in the country to farmers and melon sellers.\u201d These outdoor performances have also had a wider impact on Taiwanese life. When there were mass political demonstrations the organisers drew on Cloud Gate\u2019s experience of stewarding, providing toilets and so on. \u201cAfter our performances there is never a scrap of litter left,\u201d says Lin. \u201cWhen there were political demonstrations it was the same.\u201d Public support for the company was also demonstrated when its studio and offices burned down in 2008. Without Cloud Gate having to launch a formal appeal, 4,500 private donors \u2013 there was no government money \u2013 contributed over $20m to build it a new home. \u201cThis is how we keep going,\u201d says Lin. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a big grants. It is a people\u2019s company and a people\u2019s theatre.\u201d The company is also democratic in its makeup, with dancers ranging in age from 22 to 52. The oldest member, Wang Wei-ming, originated one of the key roles in Songs of the Wanderers and, after leaving the company to teach at university, contacted Lin asking if he could dance the part again before the show itself is retired. \u201cI was very happy for him to do this, but I wanted him to show me that he was still capable and not kidding himself. So he gave us all a dry version and the other dancers just stood and applauded. At 52 he was dancing better than many of them. There was a real substance to the work.\u201d Lin sees those same qualities in dancers who have become mothers, and he encourages them to return to the stage. \u201cThey not only have such awareness of their bodies, motherhood itself gives them a perspective about life that comes through in their dance.\u201d     Songs of the Wanderers. Photograph: Yu Hui-hung    Another long standing \u2013 literally \u2013 member of the cast is Wang Rong-yu who originated the part of the Monk. \u201cHe had no dance background, but is a practitioner of qigong, and I saw him walk into a room and knew he could do it.\u201d His performance, standing nearly motionless for 70 minutes, is a remarkable display of strength, control and concentration. \u201cHe is also now into his 50s and that\u2019s partly why I have to wrap this up,\u201d says Lin. \u201cHe is so beautiful to look at, but I don\u2019t want to torture him any more, so the work will be performed for one more season in Taiwan and then retired.\u201d Lin says that he intends to retire too. \u201cThe company will go on, even if that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean with my own works. I wouldn\u2019t want it to become a museum. When we began we wanted to perform to, and connect with, the grassroots. Forty three years later we are still doing that, which makes me very happy. This building is the completion of the first stage of my retirement. It is a house to shelter younger artists who can carry on the work. The existence of the company is an accumulation of the energy from society. So long as we maintain that supply of energy, the torch will always continue to burn.\u201d \u2022 Cloud Gate will perform Songs of the Wanderers at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London EC1, 4-7 May (sadlerswells.com), then at the international dance festival, Birmingham, 10-11 May. idfb.co.uk."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/29/three-best-new-dance-shows", "publicationDate": "2016-04-29T15:40:33Z", "tags": ["Dance", "Stage", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Sadler\u2019s Wells, EC1, Sat &amp; Sun 2: Cloud Gate Dance Theatre Of Taiwan: Songs Of The Wanderers   This venerable company, with its unique fusion of Asian tradition and contemporary dance, returns to the UK with a signature work set to Georgian folk songs (pictured)."], "title": "Three of the best\u2026 new dance performances", "article": "1: Breakin\u2019 Convention The UK\u2019s leading hip-hop theatre festival returns.

Russell, 71, has kept racing pigeons for almost half a century, taking a cleaning job after he retired as a lorry driver to be able to still afford his hobby.  Russell and his friend rushed to the nearby field where he kept his lofts to see all three burning with such ferocity the fire brigade would not let him approach. Twenty birds were burned alive, his lofts reduced to ash and twisted lengths of corrugated steel. Russell, whose great-grandchildren call him grandad pigeon, collapsed at the scene and had to be treated by paramedics. The fire on Saturday had clearly been started deliberately, but what particularly shocked Russell was its timing \u2013 a year to the day after thieves stole his best birds from the same loft. He does not know why he was targeted, but he is convinced the same culprits were behind the attack. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s local fanciers, but it\u2019s people in the pigeon fraternity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t an isolated incident, it happens all the time throughout the country. I put it down to jealousy and to stop you from competing. If it was a stable with horses, it would be all over the papers.\u201d Is he right? Certainly, the fire at Russell\u2019s loft is not unique. Last month, 140 birds were killed in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, when three lofts were set alight. Five weeks earlieran attack on the same fancier had killed 24 birds. In April, two owners in Barnsley lost 180 birds when their sheds, on an allotment in Stairfoot, were torched.     The lofts in December, before the attack. Photograph: Adrian Sherratt    In February, an attack in Washington, Sunderland, killed 100 pigeons; 300 died in December when arsonists attacked lofts on an allotment in South Shields. After 400 birds died in a blaze in Newcastle in July 2014, following a number of similar incidents in the area, the city\u2019s Evening Chronicle newspaper asked: \u201cHas the pigeon cree [loft] arsonist struck again?\u201d Though not at the heights of its 1960s heyday, pigeon fancying remains popular in Britain \u2013 more than 42,000 people keep pigeons in the UK, according to the Royal Pigeon Racing Association (RPRA), which claims the industry is worth \u00a3125m a year to the British economy. Despite its gentle and somewhat eccentric reputation, it is both highly competitive and, at times, extremely lucrative. Many races are local events with small monetary prizes, but if a bird wins a prestigious race, its value can spike to \u00a35,000, \u00a310,000 or more, according to David Power, secretary of the North of England Homing Union. Big money racers in Belgium, the heartland of pigeon racing, and increasingly in China and Taiwan, where it is booming, are willing to pay huge sums for the right birds. In 2012, a Chinese businessman paid $300,000 (\u00a3197,000) for a Belgian-bred winner called Bolt. What is the appeal for fanciers? \u201cIt\u2019s like marrying your wife,\u201d said Power, who has been keeping pigeons since he was 10. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s like supporting Newcastle United. I\u2019ve watched Newcastle United since I was 10 years old as well. We got relegated [this week], they might be rubbish, but they\u2019re still my team. It\u2019s the same with your pigeons.\u201d   Related: Pigeon fanciers take on RSPB over killer hawks    There is no question some birds are targeted because of their past success \u2013 Power says his union advises members who have had a big win to move the winning pigeon to a secure site or potentially even sell it.  But Stewart Wardrop, general manager of the Royal Pigeon Racing Association (RPRA), insists the vast majority of arson attacks on lofts are random acts of vandalism, without any more sinister purpose. \u201cMany people keep their pigeons on allotments, which are open, and by their very nature, open property is subject to attack from time to time. Has anybody ever deliberately set light to a pigeon loft? Probably, but it\u2019s not an everyday occurrence.\u201d The truth is, it is very hard to know. Prosecutions for attacks on lofts are vanishingly rare \u2013 Power says he has known of none in the 17 years he has been with the NEHU. No one was arrested over the theft of Russell\u2019s birds last year and the case was closed after a week, though a spokesman for Avon and Somerset police, which is investigating the fire, said the previous theft would be a line of inquiry. Chris Kavanagh lost 30 of his birds in December 2014 to an arson attack on lofts in his garden in Oxted, Surrey. He cannot believe he was targeted by a fellow pigeon fancier \u201cbecause I wouldn\u2019t think any real pigeon men would dream of ever doing anything like that. I think it\u2019s just yobbos. But you never know\u201d. He was devastated at the loss, but local fanciers rallied in support; one man gave him some baskets, others offered to breed him new birds. \u201cPigeon men all seem to stick together, and help each other out when something like this happens,\u201d Kavanagh said. Russell\u2019s local fanciers also rallied when his birds were stolen last year, but he says he has not got the stomach to start again. \u201cI\u2019ve got no idea why they picked on me. I don\u2019t put myself down as one of the top flyers in the country, no way. I\u2019m nowhere near that at all. I\u2019m just a family man that loved my bloody pigeons.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/16/little-blue-men-the-maritime-militias-pushing-chinas-claims-in-south-china-sea", "publicationDate": "2016-05-16T12:52:34Z", "tags": ["South China Sea", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "US news"], "sentences": ["Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam all have overlapping claims in the South China Sea, which has large oil, gas and fish reserves and strategically important shipping lanes.", "It also accused China of similarly assertive behaviour in the East China Sea and of preparing for potential conflict in the Taiwan Straits."], "title": "Little blue men: the maritime militias pushing China's claims", "article": "China is using large numbers of irregular maritime militias, dubbed \u201clittle blue men\u201d, to assert and expand its control over an increasingly large area of disputed and reclaimed islands and reefs in the strategically important South China Sea, the Pentagon says.  The militias, comprising hundreds of fishermen and motor boats mainly based on Hainan island, south of the mainland, have been involved in \u201cbuzzing\u201d US navy ships and those of neighbouring countries with rival territorial claims. By using ostensibly civilian craft and personnel, China is avoiding direct military-to-military confrontations and gaining an element of deniability, said Abraham Denmark, deputy assistant US defence secretary for east Asia, presenting a report on military security involving China.    Related: China has reclaimed 3,200 acres in the South China Sea, says Pentagon    \u201cSome of their fishing vessels and coastguards [are] acting in unprofessional manners in the vicinity of the military forces or fishing vessels of other countries in a way that\u2019s designed to attempt to establish a degree of control around disputed features,\u201d Denmark said. \u201cIt seems \u2026 these activities are designed to stay below the threshold of conflict, but gradually demonstrate and assert claims that other countries dispute.\u201d  Maritime experts say such behaviour exploits \u201cgrey zones\u201d where US navy and other countries\u2019 military rules of engagement prevent tough counter-measures.  The Chinese tactics have been likened to those of Russia during its 2014 intervention in Crimea and Ukraine, when armed forces lacking clear identification, known as \u201clittle green men\u201d, were unofficially insinuated into the region by Moscow.  \u201cChina is trying to use these government-controlled fishermen below the radar to get the bonus without the onus to support its South China Sea claims,\u201d Andrew Erickson, an associate professor at the US Naval War College, told Defense News, a US-based publication. \u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenon little known or understood in the US. While Russia\u2019s little green men in Crimea are widely known, insufficient attention has been paid to China\u2019s little blue men in the South China Sea,\u201d Erickson said.  Introducing the Pentagon\u2019s 2016 report on China\u2019s military activities, Denmark said Beijing\u2019s estimated military budget now stood at $180bn (\u00a3125bn) and it was rapidly expanding its capabilities in all areas.   South China Sea islands   China is continuing to employ \u201cassertive\u201d tactics in defiance of regional and international opinion to establish control and construct military facilities, including harbours and military air strips, on a \u201cvast acreage\u201d of either reclaimed land or existing South China Sea outposts that have been expanded. The report said China has reclaimed 3,200 acres of land in total.   \u201cChina\u2019s leadership demonstrated a willingness to tolerate higher levels of tension in pursuit of its maritime sovereignty claims \u2026 China\u2019s strategy is to secure its objectives without jeopardising the regional peace that has enabled its military and economic development, which in turn has maintained the Chinese Communist party\u2019s grip on power,\u201d Denmark said. Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam all have overlapping claims in the South China Sea, which has large oil, gas and fish reserves and strategically important shipping lanes. The US takes no sides in the disputes, but the US navy regularly patrols the area to maintain freedom of navigation in international waters.  According to the Pentagon, the maritime militias are drawn from China\u2019s fishing fleet, which is officially said to number 21 million fishermen and 439,000 motor boats. The best-known are based in Hainan province, where local communities have long-standing historical and commercial interests in the South China Sea.  Hainan\u2019s Tanmen militia, founded in 1985 at a port on the island\u2019s east coast, was honoured by Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, who paid a visit to commemorate the so-called Scarborough Shoal incident in April 2012 when eight Tanmen fishing vessels defied a Philippines warship.   The Tanmen fishermen were lauded as an \u201cadvanced militia unit\u201d by state media after the incident. Xi reportedly complimented them on their actions and urged them to build larger vessels, collect information in distant waters and support \u201cisland and reef\u201d development. According to a recent analysis by Erickson and Conor Kennedy for the Centre for International Maritime Security, \u201cChinese media coverage of Tanmen fishermen often states that a large portion of incidents in the South China Sea between Chinese fishermen and foreign states is attributable to the Tanmen fishermen and maritime militia, whose members resolutely oppose \u2018foreign encroachment\u2019.\u201d   China Daily, a state media outlet, praised the maritime militias in February, saying they were improving their operational capabilities in line with the government\u2019s new emphasis on safeguarding China\u2019s maritime interests.  \u201cAccording to the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) Beihai city military command in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, the proportion of maritime militia increased tenfold over the past two years. This enabled the city\u2019s maritime militia to play a bigger role in the PLA navy, taking part in seven drills last year \u2026 Most of the maritime militia is made up of local fishermen.\u201d   Related: China to begin civilian flights to disputed South China Sea island     Chinese navy veterans have been recruited to boost the militias, which were being expanded in other coastal areas, the paper said. Local fishermen had assisted in more than 250 \u201claw enforcement operations\u201d in the past three years.   The difficulties involved in dealing with irregular maritime forces were illustrated last autumn when an American destroyer, the USS Lassen, passed close to a newly-built artificial island on Subi Reef in the Spratlys. It was already being shadowed by several Chinese navy warships, which behaved professionally and kept a safe distance, Defense News reported.  But several other smaller vessels, described as merchant ships or fishing vessels, were deliberately provocative, harassing the Lassen, crossing its bow and manoeuvring around the destroyer \u2013 behaviour to which the American ship had no ready reply. In a separate incident in 2014, Vietnamese ships were rammed by Chinese militia vessels.   Erickson said the maritime militias were designed to undertake such deception and obstruction activities. \u201cThe militia on board the ships were often clearly identifiable. They have uniforms \u2013 many if not all of them have uniforms. Putting on camouflage [uniforms], they qualify as soldiers. Taking off the camouflage, they become law-abiding fishermen.\u201d  The Pentagon report claimed that, overall, Beijing was continuing down a path towards greater power projection, more advanced missiles and weaponry, and improved cyberspace and space capabilities. It also accused China of similarly assertive behaviour in the East China Sea and of preparing for potential conflict in the Taiwan Straits.  China reacted angrily to the report. Yang Yujun, spokesman for China\u2019s national defence ministry, said it perpetuated the cliche of a Chinese military threat. \u201c[It] wantonly distorted China\u2019s national defence policy and the legal activities in the East and South China Seas,\u201d he said.

Each and every one of us participated in this journey. My dear fellow Taiwanese, we did it.\u201d Tsai, who some call the Angela Merkel of the east, said her government\u2019s top priority was reviving the island\u2019s flagging economy. \u201cThe people elected a new president and new government with one single expectation: solving problems,\u201d she said.  \u201cAt this very moment, Taiwan faces a difficult situation that requires its leaders to shoulder the burdens without hesitation. This is something I will not forget.\u201d  Earlier, Tsai escorted Ma Ying-jeou, the outgoing Nationalist party president, from the presidential palace in Taipei as part of the symbolic transfer of power. About 20,000 guests and supporters turned out to watch proceedings as Taiwan\u2019s first female leader took office.  \u201cI want to witness this sacred moment,\u201d Chen Su-mei, a 48-year-old teacher who was among the crowds, told Channel News Asia.  \u201cI hope she will bring more stability to Taiwan and revive our economy. We have high hopes for her.\u201d Jonathan Sullivan, a Taiwan exprt from the University of Nottingham, said Tsai faced \u201ca slew of domestic issues\u201d, the most pressing of which was injecting new life into the economy. \u201cTsai needs to make fast and tangible progress on the socio-economic issues that decided the election, and that will be the priority.\u201d Sullivan said Tsai had pledged to increase wages and provide affordable housing. \u201cBut this is easier said than done.\u201d J Michael Cole, a Taipei-based political observer, said Tsai\u2019s political honeymoon would be short.  \u201cEverybody you talk to [says], \u2018We want her to improve the economy,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cExpectations are high. People here are probably going to be impatient and that will be a headache for Tsai because no matter how good she might be, turning around that sagging economy will take a while. Nothing will happen over night. It is going to take months if not years before they succeed, if they succeed.\u201d Experts believe Taiwan\u2019s thorny relationship with Beijing may also prove a severe challenge for its new leader.  Tsai\u2019s predecessor oversaw an unprecedented rapprochement with China but her election was widely seen as a sign of public frustration that such a policy had failed to benefit Taiwan\u2019s 23 million citizens. On Friday, Taiwan\u2019s new leader hinted she would seek to reduce its economic dependence on mainland China. \u201cWe will\u2026 bid farewell to our past over-reliance on a single market,\u201d she said.  Tsai\u2019s victory has gone down badly with China\u2019s Communist party rulers, who still lay claim to the island and view her independence-leaning party with mistrust.  Officially, Beijing still hopes to reabsorb Taiwan, which has been self-ruled since 1949, and in the wake of Tsai\u2019s victory Beijing has warned that she must explicitly state her commitment to the so-called \u201cone China principle\u201d \u2013 the idea that Taiwan and mainland China are a single nation.  Tsai made no such commitment in her speech, referring simply to a controversial 1992 \u201cconsensus\u201d about the island\u2019s status as a \u201chistorical fact\u201d.  Tsai vowed to make her country \u201ca staunch guardian of peace\u201d but risked angering China\u2019s authoritarian leaders by repeatedly referring to Taiwan as a \u201ccountry\u201d, a notion Beijing rejects. Sullivan said such allusions were \u201csure to displease Beijing\u201d.  \u201cAll told, this is not a speech Beijing wanted to hear,\u201d he said. \u201cBeijing already eyed her with great suspicion, and this speech will confirm them.\u201d  In an editorial the Beijing-controlled Global Times newspaper warned that cross-strait ties were entering an \u201cera of uncertainty\u201d.  While Tsai\u2019s comments on the relationship with China grabbed headlines, most of her speech focused on domestic issues, with the president vowing to reform the pension system and inject new \u201cmomentum\u201d into the economy. \u201cThis country urgently needs a new model for economic development,\u201d Tsai said. Tsai, who has a PhD in law from the London School of Economics, also vowed to set up a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate human rights abuses committed during decades of military rule between 1947 and 1987. \u201cWe will discover the truth, heal wounds, and clarify responsibilities. From here on out, history will no longer divide Taiwan. Instead, it will propel Taiwan forward.\u201d Cole said enthusiasm about the rise of Taiwan\u2019s first female leader was tempered by the fact that her cabinet was packed with middle-aged men and technocrats.  Voters hoping for an administration as diverse as that of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were disappointed. \u201cUnfortunately Tsai does not seem to have been willing to or capable of taking such chances. So we are seeing a new cabinet that is oddly reminiscent of the one that just resigned.

His three-day trip has been seen as an attempt to bolster Vietnam\u2019s capacity to deal with China\u2019s claims in the South China Sea. China has built military installations, including runways and missile launchers, on reclaimed islands, often in areas also claimed by Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Japan. The South China Sea is thought to have significant oil and gas reserves and is a route for about $4.5tn (\u00a33.2tn) in trade.

The franchise is also driving into other Asian markets with a \u201cstrong\u201d performance in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and the Philippines. \u201cWe do believe we can get Peppa to $2bn in sales in the medium term,\u201d said Willits. \u201cWe are really only just starting in the US, which is far and away the biggest market for licensing and merchandising in the order of 50% of the total [globally]. Momentum is really building there and there are opportunities opening in markets like France and China.\u201d A new 52-episode series of Peppa Pig is due to be ready for broadcast in July.  Late last year, E1 took a 70% stake in UK producer Astley Baker Davies, the creator of Peppa Pig, in a \u00a3140m deal giving it 85% control of the rights to the franchise.    Related: Entertainment One takes control of Peppa Pig creator in \u00a3140m deal    On Tuesday, E1 reported that pre-tax profits grew 9% to \u00a347.9m in the year to the end of March as the family division, driven by Peppa, and its TV operation offsetting a poor performance by its film division. Total revenues snuck up 2% to \u00a3802.7m, but only thanks to the injection of income from new acquisitions such as a majority stake in the Mark Gordon Company, the producer of shows including Grey\u2019s Anatomy and films such as Saving Private Ryan.  Entertainment One\u2019s own television division, which includes shows such as Rookie Blue and Saving Hope as well as distributing The Walking Dead, saw revenues rise 27% to \u00a3187.9m and profits rise 44% to \u00a323m. A mixture of box office flops and fewer releases saw profits at the film division, responsible for titles including Oscar winner Spotlight and Quentin Tarantino\u2019s The Hateful Eight, drop 28% to \u00a353m and revenues fall 7% to \u00a3553m. Investment in productions fell 45% year on year to just \u00a311.9m. The company, which announced a \u00a310m cost-cutting programme in the division after its poor performance became obvious late last year, is expecting a bounce back in 2016 with 220 releases, including the movie version of hit book Girl on a Train, BFG and Ricky Gervais\u2019s big-screen spinoff of The Office, David Brent: Life on the Road. \u201cWe feel very confident about the release slate,\u201d said Willits. \u201cThe last two years have had weaker slates than maybe we would want, but we feel much more positive about this year. It is about the ebbs and flows of a release schedule and the mixture of films. Some films are big, others are not.

Concerning the upcoming British referendum on the EU (13 May), people tend to discuss the issue as \u201cis Europe good for Britain?\u201d Perhaps one might also like to ask \u201cis Britain good for Europe?\u201d Apart from being geographically disconnected from Europe and viewing itself as an Atlantic \u2013 rather than European \u2013 nation, Britain is not a founding member of the EU. It jumped a moving train that had already left the station in 1973. And for a very long time after the 12 nations had made up the EU, it was rather we European nations plus Britain. But this was only the beginning of a tenuous, if not tedious, relationship. Whenever we 11 wanted to regulate something like, for example, protecting pregnant women in the workplace, Britain\u2019s veto was assured and we received a handbag with a brick inside from Britain\u2019s PM, Maggie Thatcher \u2013 a woman. The latest example is perhaps the European drive to eliminate tax havens where the rich park their money, thereby excluding themselves from fair taxation as the Panama Papers have shown so pointedly (13 May). While Europe wants to eliminate tax havens, Britain\u2019s David Cameron wants to protect money deposited in them, most of which are run as BOTs \u201cBritish overseas territories\u201d such as the Cayman Islands.

It is important, however, to acknowledge two further points that led to the realisation of Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s dream. First, he came to power in 1959 on a leftwing ticket with the support of the Communist party. Then he started the massive flat-building programme through the Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the poor and low-income groups. He knew that communists could be turned into capitalists if people were given a roof over their heads, and a job to go to in the morning. Thousands of people were employed in the HDB building programme. As Marshall points out, HDB subsidised rents for the poor, and helped them to buy flats through a compulsory savings plan. Lee thus wiped out communism without firing a single shot. Second, he disciplined the people: taught them to walk forward in steps, instead of round and round, as in other developing nations. Lee\u2019s discipline also included wiping out corruption and drug-taking among the population. He used undemocratic means to achieve his ends; however, he was able to make Singapore one of the richest and most peaceful countries in the world within a generation. Singapore may be the only nation to attain such success without handouts from rich nations.Maggie FookeMelbourne, Australia Fair criticism of Israel As a Brit, a Canadian and a long-term reader of the Guardian, I am perplexed that your paper does not challenge the questionable view (as in the article on Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn on 6 May) that Zionism and Judaism are identical and that genuine criticism of Israeli politics is anti-Jewish or antisemitic. I join my leftwing Jewish friends who are ashamed of the racism so evident in the policies of modern-day Israel. They are ashamed that the genuine tragedy of the Holocaust is often used to justify oppression in Palestine. Many in Canada support boycotting goods that come from the lands taken under the occupation, contrary to many United Nations public statements of policy. Please publish a balanced article that shows that many of us support Judaism but do not support the occupation. We look forward to some objective criticism of the distorted views we read about in present-day British politics.Christine JohnstonVictoria, British Columbia, Canada Free trade pact a disaster I was somewhat shocked by Timothy Garton Ash\u2019s apparent belief that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreement would be something that would \u201cstrengthen the west\u201d (6 May). In his support of TTIP, Garton Ash quotes Barack Obama, who praised \u201cdemocracy, the rule of law and open markets\u201d . I really don\u2019t know what planet Garton Ash and Obama are on, but it is patently obvious that TTIP damages all three of these \u201cdesirables\u201d: TTIP\u2019s intense secrecy and its giving power to private tribunals to override governments negate both democracy and the rule of law. On top of this, we all know that it will be the powerful multinationals that will gain most from TTIP, so how can this be good for open markets? The simple law of \u201ceconomies of scale\u201d will cause a further lurch towards global oligarchies, which has nothing whatsoever to do with a healthy market. I found myself shaking my head at this article as Garton Ash made attempts to dredge \u201cshining western values\u201d out of the west\u2019s not-too-sparkling recent history. The war in Iraq, our hypocrisy and our constant prodding of those perceived as \u201cbaddies\u201d (eg drone warfare) all go to create more problems than they solve and it certainly doesn\u2019t help to try to bump all \u201cevil\u201d into the laps of convenient bogeymen.Alan SearleCologne, Germany \u2022 I often see as exaggerations certain claims that France, Europe or the US are not democracies, either because there is too much money involved in elections or because they are representation-based systems where the people have barely any direct voice. I generally think it a good idea if you can periodically elect your representatives. But with these stories about global free trade agreements, when everything is made to keep the details secret, as described by Trevor Timm (13 May), it is clear that the cornerstone of a democratic government \u2013 of, by and for the people \u2013 has been betrayed. No wonder the populists are booming everywhere. Marc JachymLes Ulis, France Briefly \u2022 The description of the 4,800-year-old human fossil from Taiwan that showed a mother looking down at a child that she was cradling in her arms (6 May), manifests the fundamental humanity of mankind. The archaeologists were said to have been \u201cshocked\u201d by the striking juxtaposition. However, it should be noted that there is a precedent of similar type from 7,000 years ago at Vedbaek in Denmark, where a mother who died in childbirth was buried in a position as though sheltering her newborn infant, which was lying on the wing of a swan.Anthony WalterSurrey, British Columbia, Canada \u2022 I agree with Angela Moore that Six-year-olds do not need grammar drills (6 May). Perhaps the high turnover of ideas is responsible for this silly policy. If British classics like James Britton\u2019s Language and Learning or Joan Tough\u2019s Listening to Children Talking were known to current higher educational authorities, they wouldn\u2019t impose such meaningless demands.

Wong grew up in Hong Kong, where fruits and vegetables were scarce and imported. After attending college in upstate New York, she moved to California, the largest agricultural state in the country. Soon, though, Wong discovered something was off. \u201cAt the market, I\u2019d see farmers getting ready to throw out boxes and boxes of fruit and vegetables they couldn\u2019t sell,\u201d she says. \u201cI was shocked.\u201d To preserve as much of the unwanted produce as possible, she launched a jam company called Revive Foods. But one year in, she realized she was spending a great deal of energy finding the produce and making sure it got used in time. What the area needed, she decided, was a marketplace to enable dozens of small businesses to turn a surplus bounty into jam, juice, baby food and other products. The result, Cerplus, which launched in January with the aim of reducing the millions of tons of unwanted fruits and vegetables from farms and retailers nationwide. Unsold produce from supermarkets accounts for about $15bn each year, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Cerplus buyers sign up to get a daily email or text alert about surplus produce deals that are typically around 30% off the standard wholesale price. Cerplus arranges for delivery and takes a small cut. So far, Wong says the company has moved more than 11,000 lbs of produce from 20 farms and produce distributors within California.     Companies such as Souper Seconds and Cerplus have developed web and mobile services to help farmers find buyers of surplus or imperfect-looking produce. Composite: Souper Seconds &amp; Cerplus    This nascent effort isn\u2019t unique. Throughout Silicon Valley, and beyond, technology companies are working to keep food out of landfills. And, like Cerplus, many of them are tackling food recovery \u2013 diverting imperfect or extra food to ensure it gets eaten \u2013 through web and mobile services. The newly launched San Francisco-based Souper Seconds focuses on selling organic blemished and overstock produce from farms to wholesellers. Washington DC-based Food Cowboy and Berkeley-based Copia both manage and deliver food donations. In the Boston area, graduate students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are building Spoiler Alert to help organizations meet different food waste reduction goals. The first part of Spoiler Alert is a free online marketplace that allows businesses, including farms, to sell or donate surplus food to hunger relief groups via apps, texts or emails. Zero Percent has an app that offers a similar service in Chicago. Leftover Swap helps smartphone users swap or give away their leftover food. \u201cFood waste happens not because businesses intend to waste the food but because they\u2019re often disconnected from one another and lack a real-time solution,\u201d says Ricky Ashenfelter, co-founder and CEO of Spoiler Alert.  Hunger relief organizations also are turning to technology to help manage donations. Feeding America, the nation\u2019s largest hunger relief organization, is building an online portal to match food donors with food banks and other community meal service groups nationwide. Businesses that donate could benefit from a federal legislation passed last December, which allows more businesses to get tax deductions for donating food. Developing technology only solves part of the problem, however. Attracting loyal users is the key. \u201cThe challenge these companies all have is reaching a critical mass. Craigslist is only valuable because everyone\u2019s on it,\u201d says Dana Gunders, senior scientist at Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).     Food waste happens from farm to table. More than 133bn pounds of food is thrown away in the country each year, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Photograph: Souper Seconds    While salvaging surplus food is a good strategy for solving the national food waste problem, preventing it from materializing in the first place should be a priority, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\u2019s guideline on reducing food waste. Reducing the need to grow, ship and buy food leads to a much larger reduction in greenhouse gasses and greater savings. Prevention is one of the goals of LeanPath, founded in 2004 to develop software for kitchens in colleges, hospitals, corporate dining facilities, hotels and military bases. Overstocking food is a common practice because of worries about running out of supplies and keeping display cases filled, says Andrew Shakman, LeanPath\u2019s CEO.   Related: How the US can solve its multibillion food waste problem  - report    Kitchen crews don\u2019t usually consider the myriad of financial and environmental costs of trashing unused ingredients or uneaten dishes. If they do, then they are likely to be more mindful of buying and cooking only enough to meet demand. Each LeanPath system comes with scales, a camera and a digital terminal for the kitchen workers to weigh what they plan to toss away and enter data about the ingredient types and quantities. \u201cWhile you record [what you\u2019re getting rid of], we\u2019re telling you what it\u2019s worth in dollars, the environmental implications, the cost, how many cars on the road it represents. Trying to make it vivid and alive for people,\u201d Shakman says. The University of California in San Francisco has been using LeanPath for two years. The technology helps the kitchen managers at one of its hospitals to pinpoint problems and solutions, according to Dan Henroid, the university\u2019s director of nutrition and food services. The system has already changed the kitchen staff\u2019s food preparation practices, cut the amount of waste by 34.5% and saved nearly $60,000 in the past two years, Henroid says. For example, the cooks now make sure they use all of the meat they buy, including using leftovers to make new dishes. \u201cWhen we started we were seeing a lot of wasted protein,\u201d Henroid recalls. Considering the high carbon footprint of meat production, he continues: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to make a decision to purchase meat, we better use it to our best ability and not be throwing it out.\u201d Figuring out new uses for other excess ingredients, such as cooked vegetables, rice and scrambled eggs, can prove more challenging.      LeanPath\u2019s technology encourages kitchen crews to reduce waste by showing them the values of foods they are tossing away. Photograph: LeanPath    But, while prevention is effective, it can be less gratifying, Shakman says. \u201cFood service employees really like donation because it\u2019s a chance for them to be philanthropic. We just don\u2019t want to see excess production get institutionalized in order to donate because it\u2019s a highly inefficient way to get food to people in need.\u201d   Related: In Taiwan, leftover food scraps help farmers sustain porky appetites    To preserve the philanthropic opportunity, Shakman recommends that companies set aside a portion of the money they save from reducing food waste and donate it to those in need. Meanwhile, Cerplus is looking at expanding its services to promote prevention. Wong says she would like to help farmers secure purchase contracts before each harvest season begins. Ultimately, Gunders says, eliminating food waste is about changing our cultural practices. She points to an example in South Korea, where a company has built scales and sensors into trash bins to measure the amount of food waste tossed away by their customers, who must scan their ID cards to use the bins. An operator then collects the data and bills people for exceeding what they are allowed to throw away. \u201cBehavior is such a core component of preventing food waste,\u201d Gunders says. \u201cWithout that we\u2019re sort of dancing on the precipice.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/08/belgium-nations-vulnerable-hacking-exposed-servers-rapid7-heat-map-internet", "publicationDate": "2016-06-08T12:09:25Z", "tags": ["Internet", "Hacking", "Data and computer security", "Technology", "Belgium", "Australia news", "Samoa", "Tajikistan", "Europe", "Encryption"], "sentences": ["Taiwan, Province of China 34."], "title": "Belgium tops list of nations most vulnerable to hacking", "article": "A new \u201cheat map of the internet\u201d has revealed the countries most vulnerable to hacking attacks, by scanning the entire internet for servers with their front doors wide open. Produced by information security firm Rapid7, the National Exposure Index finds that the most exposed country in the world is Belgium, followed by Tajikistan, Samoa and Australia. The US comes 14th and the UK 23rd. The map of the internet was produced by Rapid7\u2019s Project Sonar, a tool which allows the firm to scan every single public-facing IP address in a matter of hours, and look at which services they are offering to the wider internet. Many, even most, of those services will be appropriate. For instance, a web server with an open port 80, the \u201cdoor\u201d through which HTTP web pages are sent through, is appropriate (even if the encrypted version, HTTPS, would be more secure). But eight of the top 10 services offered by servers on the internet are unencrypted, such as POP3, an outdated email protocol, and FTP, an insecure method of transferring files over the net. Having a port open to an insecure service doesn\u2019t mean that the server itself is insecure. But, as Rapid7 explains, \u201cthe more services offered by a server or device, the greater the attack surface/exposure of that server or device\u201d. If the server cannot be connected to by a particular service, it can\u2019t be hacked through that service, and so the vulnerability to hacking attacks rises proportionally to the number of services offered by a server. An open door doesn\u2019t make a business necessarily unsafe, for example; but a business with 20 open doors is likely to be much harder to keep secure than a business with just one.     Political map of the internet as seen by Rapid7: each pixel represents 254 IP addresses, colour coded by geographic location. For another view of the same map, turn to XKCD. Photograph: Rapid7    Tod Beardsley, one of the report\u2019s three authors, was surprised by his own findings. \u201cWe expected to find that the most exposed countries were also the richest,\u201d he explained. The richest countries (by aggregate GDP, which place large countries like China near the top of the list) were likely to have the most net-connected devices, which should mean they proportionally have the most potential for damage. \u201cIf you\u2019re a rich country, you have a lot of internet. But we didn\u2019t find any correlation between the number of nodes and the exposure.\u201d Hence Belgium\u2019s position at the top of the exposure list. While the country has fewer nodes than China, a greater proportion of them are offering connections to services which are often insecure at the best of times. Beardsley gives the example of database protocols: while there may be reasons to want to connect directly to a database remotely, doing so introduces a large risk that someone will do so without permission \u2013 and steal information. (To be precise, Beardsley described the motivation of an admin placing a database on the net as \u201c\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\u201d.) The motivation for launching the mapping project was an attempt to comprehensively determine quite how insecure the net is. \u201cEverything is on the internet and it\u2019s all broken,\u201d Beardsley says. Previous comprehensive scans have been carried out, such as the 2012 Internet Census, but all to date have been one-off measures. The Internet Census, for example, traded comprehensiveness for repeatability: its methodology involved legally questionable access to household routers in order to perform the scans; if Rapid7\u2019s approach involves pushing on doors to see if they\u2019re open, the Internet Census followed up by actually going in the building to see what it could find. In the future, Beardsley hopes to repeat the survey regularly, to finally discover whether or not the internet is moving in a good direction. The hope is that the worst of the insecure servers will go offline over the next few years, but as the internet of things becomes a major source of new connected devices, the status quo could change for the worse rather than the better.

This year\u2019s line-up includes Ada/Ava by Manual Cinema. Photograph: Manual Cinema    The event officially celebrates its 70th anniversary next year, marking its foundation in 1947 as an alternative to the new official festival, but this year\u2019s headline figures show signs that it may have hit its peak after years of continuous growth, just as a new fringe chief executive, Shona McCarthy, takes the helm. The number of performances in this year\u2019s programme, at 50,266, is slightly lower than last year, while the number of venues in Edinburgh has fallen too, with events heavily focused on the city centre. That partly reflects a decision to take several events for arts professionals off the public programme.  The number of free shows has fallen too, to 643, a trend compensated for by a rise in the number of \u201cpay what you want\u201d productions to 164. The overall proportion of genres in this year\u2019s programme is almost identical to last year. Among the 10 genres overall, 34% is again comedy; 27% is theatre, 15% is music, up slightly on last year; while dance and physical theatre has fallen by 1% to 3%.  McCarthy, who was appointed as fringe chief executive five months ago after success as director of festivals in Derry, Belfast and the Foyle film festival in Northern Ireland, said she was not troubled by the headline data but said she was keen to increase productions from other Scottish towns and cities, and from overseas.  \u201cIs it peak fringe? Well, no,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cSomething radical could happen next year and that\u2019s the nature of this beast, I think, and that is that things can change.\u201d      The number of fringe venues in Edinburgh city centre has fallen this year. Photograph: Alamy    She is targeting performers in Dundee, Glasgow and Aberdeen, and countries such as India, which has a wealth of artistic history and talent yet is poorly represented at the fringe. This year\u2019s festival will feature productions from 48 countries, just over a quarter of the number worldwide. McCarthy said contemporary politics and modern life were significant themes. \u201cPeople in various countries have clearly picked up on the questions of truth, honesty and lies,\u201d she said. With events heavily focused this year on the city centre, with only three sites in Leith taking part, the fringe has also appointed a community engagement officer to increase its visibility and involvement by young people across the city. McCarthy faces heavy pressure on funding: Edinburgh council is to cut arts financing by 10% over the next few years to cope with a fall in Scottish government spending. She said it was imperative that political leaders protected funding.  \u201cDo not chip away, by killing by small cuts, the most incredible arts and cultural celebration that I have seen anywhere in the world,\u201d she said.

Photograph: Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty Images    \u201cMy experience is just one part of the boundless suffering of the Chinese race under the cruelest regime in human history,\u201d the author writes in the introduction to the book\u2019s unpublished 87,000-word English translation, according to a transcript seen by the Guardian.  The first section of Gao\u2019s memoir focuses on a six-year spate of abductions and torture sessions while its latter half describes the \u201chellish\u201d period he spent in prison in the remote western region of Xinjiang between 2011 and 2014.  Describing the first time he was snatched, in Shaanxi province in 2004, Gao recalls being picked up and \u201cpounced on\u201d by a group of men outside an airport in the city of Xiangyang.  \u201cI thought I\u2019d encountered a band of highway robbers, never thinking that these outlaws were actually with the government,\u201d he writes, recalling how he was immobilised and suffocated by his captors in the back of a vehicle.  \u201cRealising that discussing the law with them would be like playing piano for a buffalo, I could only proceed forward pressed between them,\u201d Gao adds.  Later in the book the outspoken lawyer describes a 20-day torture session he says took place in 2007 inside a guesthouse that agents had commandeered to use as a \u201ctorture chamber\u201d.  \u201cWe always hear how strong and stalwart a hero is in the face of torture, how he refused to utter a sound, but in my judgment this is utterly bogus and impossible,\u201d Gao writes of the episode. \u201cI\u2019m sure that my screams were absolutely hair-raising and audible for five or six floors in either direction. \u201cI myself had never before heard the kind of noises I made, which emerged from me of their own volition and outside of my control,\u201d adds Gao, whose wife and two children fled to exile in the United States in 2009.  A spokeswoman for China\u2019s public security ministry told the Associated Press it had no information about Gao\u2019s treatment while in custody or prison and had not been directly involved with his case.  The publication of Gao\u2019s book comes as a major crackdown on free speech \u2013 described by observers as one of the harshest in decades \u2013 unfolds in mainland China.  Almost one year after police launched what activists call an unprecedented \u201cwar on law\u201d designed to stifle dissent, more than 20 human rights lawyers and their staff remain in custody, the majority facing subversion charges.  Gao, a former member of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, made a name for himself as one of China\u2019s most combative and fearless civil rights lawyers, defending downtrodden Chinese citizens including underground Christians and the victims of land grabs.  \u201cThe Communist party has done too many evil and cruel things. So I must fight them,\u201d he told the Guardian in 2006, adding: \u201cI am a warrior who does not care whether I live or die.\u201d Gao\u2019s unflinching stance \u2013 and in particular his defence of members of the banned spiritual movement Falun Gong \u2013 led to the years of persecution described in his memoir. The book, which took about three months to write and was concluded in March last year, also contains a withering critique of President Xi Jinping\u2019s administration.  Under Xi \u201cwe see no sign of any move toward \u2018rule of law\u2019\u201d, Gao writes. Instead Xi\u2019s priority has been \u201cto maintain the [Communist party\u2019s] dictatorial status and eliminate rivals\u201d.  Speaking this week, Gao said he was unafraid of the consequences of his writings.  \u201cOnce one has chosen to engage in combat, then there is no such thing as giving up,\u201d he said.

Remarkably, the US solar energy industry is now entering what may be its most prosperous decade ever, thanks to a new wave of federal and state policies and positive economics in the industry, both at home and abroad. \u201cI think it will actually be bigger than people are projecting,\u201d says Jigar Shah, president and co-founder of Generate Capital, a clean energy investment firm based in San Francisco. \u201cThe solar industry is booming right now.\u201d The US solar industry expects to install 14.5 gigawatts of solar power in 2016, a 94% increase over the record 7.5 gigawatts last year, according to a new market report by GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association. Revenues from solar installations also increased 21% from 2014 to more than $22bn in 2015. For the first time, more solar systems came online than natural gas power plants \u2013 the top source of electricity in the US \u2013 in 2015, as measured in megawatts, said Justin Baca, vice president of markets and research at the Solar Energy Industries Association. This year, new solar is expected to surpass installations of all other sources, said the US Energy Information Administration.      Data: SEIA/GTM Research. Illustration: Ucilia Wang/The Guardian    The rise of solar energy use, especially by homes and businesses with panels on their roofs, is gradually transforming the electricity industry. For more than a century, power plant owners and utilities have controlled the energy delivery service, and some of them enjoy a monopoly. \u201cWe were just a tiny little speck 10 years ago, and now we are really up there with the major established generating technologies,\u201d said Baca. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d Sunny path What\u2019s behind all this? A federal tax credit has played a key role: it enables home and business owners to take off 30% of the price of their solar energy systems from their income taxes. Congress renewed the tax credit last December. Another factor is cost. It is simply a lot cheaper to install solar these days, largely because cost of components have declined considerably. The wholesale price of a solar panel today is about $0.65 per watt, compared with $0.74 per watt a year ago and $4 per watt in 2008. The steep decline in prices began initially in Germany. In 2000, Germany adopted policies that heavily subsidized solar power by adding a special charge on consumer utility bills. Utilities use the money collected from that special charge to pay higher rates for solar energy as part of a government policy to promote renewable energy. The higher rates created a huge demand for solar panels, driving manufacturers to compete for those dollars and other countries to institute similar policies. Until last year, it was the largest solar energy producing country in the world. \u201cThey created a massive demand for solar, and manufacturers around the world started stepping up to that,\u201d Baca said. \u201cPrior to that, a lot of solar panels were still largely made by hand. But the scale that manufacturers started growing to allowed a little bit more automation.\u201d   Related: Can you power a business on 100% renewable energy? Ikea wants to try    Then China, where labor costs were lower, rose to become a mighty manufacturing force. Chinese manufacturers built massive factories to make solar panels, drove down the prices for solar panels and forced more than a hundred of its competitors in Europe, US and even within China to go bankrupt. The fallout hurt so many businesses that the US government imposed tariffs on Chinese-made solar panels after determining that Chinese manufacturers were pricing their products at below fair-market values. The tariffs and increasing domestic demand have boosted manufacturing jobs in the US, which is now one of the top five nations for solar panel producers behind China, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. \u201cNow the market\u2019s so large you can actually sustain the large manufacturing plants and support the product locally,\u201d said Shah. One example is SolarCity, which is building a giant new solar panel factory in Buffalo, New York. The facility, expected to be in operation later this year, plans to employ 3,500 people. It will produce panels primarily for SolarCity\u2019s own projects around the world. Declines in other sources of electricity generation has also helped solar\u2019s growing popularity. The coal business suffered historic losses in 2015 as concern about its greenhouse gas emissions took hold. Just 3 megawatts of new coal generation came online in 2015, compared to about 2,600 megawatts for solar, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Photograph: Eric Kruzewski for the Guardian    Dark clouds ahead? Although the solar market is booming overall, its reliance on government incentives makes it vulnerable to the whims of policymakers. In Nevada, once considered a role model for solar development and a national leader for solar jobs per capita, the state Public Utilities Commission approved a major rollback of solar subsidies and policies last December. The commission voted in response to a complaint by the state\u2019s largest utility, NV Energy, which contended that the subsidy \u2013 and the billing process required for the program \u2013 threatened its profitability. That change prompted SolarCity, one of America\u2019s largest solar companies, to stop selling and installing new systems in Nevada and take some 550 jobs with it. Another company, Sunrun, did the same. As a result, the industry association expects Nevada to drop from the fifth-largest state for residential solar installations in 2015 to 31st by the end of this year. Robert Boehm, director of the Center for Energy Research at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, said the changes could mean trouble ahead for the industry as a whole. \u201cMy opinion is that many of the utilities in the US would like to do this in general,\u201d Boehm said of curtailing state solar incentives and policies. \u201cThe whole rooftop solar thing has really gone south (in Nevada). We were amongst one of better states in terms of supporting rooftop solar. Now we are down amongst probably the worst.\u201d Energy storage presents another obstacle. Solar remains a small contributor to the nation\u2019s energy supply, accounting for less than 1% percent of total electricity production. As it grows and replaces traditional sources of energy, which can produce electricity any time, the need to make solar energy available even when the sun isn\u2019t shining will only grow.   Related: Businesses have seen the light with solar energy and it's finally paying off    Batteries are emerging to be the solution, but the technology and the manufacturing scale aren\u2019t improving quick enough to make it financially feasible for the masses. One company, Tesla Motors, is attempting to address that problem by building a massive factory in Nevada to build lithium-ion batteries that will go into energy storage packs designed by Tesla for homes and businesses. Tesla is counting on battery sales to complement its electric car business. Its CEO, Elon Musk, surprised investors last week when he announced Tesla\u2019s plan to buy SolarCity. Musk is the chairman of SolarCity\u2019s board of directors. Boehm, who has solar panels on the roof of his home, said cheaper batteries will nudge more people to invest in solar equipment. \u201cI\u2019m kind of an enthusiast, but I wouldn\u2019t do it right now,\u201d Boehm said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the costs are right. We\u2019re seeing the price of batteries come down and they\u2019re improving the performance of them too. The movement\u2019s in the right direction.\u201d Shah takes a different view. Consumers shouldn\u2019t have to worry about energy storage because they can always count on the utilities if their own solar panels aren\u2019t producing energy, he said. Utilities, on the other hand, should invest in more renewable energy and storage to meet the growing demand and ensure a stable flow of electricity. \u201cThe amount of capital and investment going into to solar is at an all-time high,\u201d Shah said. \u201cI think the economics are clearly very good and we haven\u2019t really even tapped but a very small percentage of our opportunities.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/30/chinese-officials-hire-gangsta-rappers-to-boost-chinas-image-abroad", "publicationDate": "2016-06-30T15:23:12Z", "tags": ["China", "Rap", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Music"], "sentences": ["One track called The Force of Red contains a vicious attack on Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan\u2019s first female president, who took office last month vowing to reduce the self-ruled island\u2019s dependence on Beijing.", "Last year, the ministry of culture banned 120 songs that allegedly \u201ctrumpeted obscenity, violence, crime or harmed social morality\u201d, almost half of which were by rappers from China and Taiwan..

CD Rev, whose four members are from the south-western city of Chengdu \u2013 home to a nascent hip-hop scene, released their first state-sponsored track this week in association with the party\u2019s youth wing, the Communist Youth League.  The four-minute English-language track, called This is China, takes aim at what it claims are western lies about the country.  \u201cI wanna restore the impression you have on my country, China, which have been exactly fabricated by media for such a long time,\u201d the lyrics say.  Wang Zixin, one of the rappers, told the Guardian his group had opted to rap in English to communicate directly with a western audience.      Two members of CD Rev. Photograph: Handout    \u201cThe western world doesn\u2019t know China very well, just as Chinese people don\u2019t know the western world. We need communication,\u201d said Wang, 22, whose stage name is Chuckie. \u201cI want to showcase the fact that Chinese people are not ignorant, especially our new generation.\u201d Writing on their official Weibo account, CD Rev said: \u201cOur friends from the west, if you still get to know China from foreign media such as CNN, AP and Reuters, the China you know surely isn\u2019t the real China.\u201d  The lyrics of This is China trumpet Chinese successes such as its space programme, widening access to education and Tu Youyou\u2019s Nobel prize for medicine last year. \u201cThe red dragon ain\u2019t no evil/ but a peaceful place,\u201d the song says.  It also touches on notorious Chinese problems such as food safety, political corruption and smog, arguing that the Communist party is trying to address these issues. \u201cIt is real that the pollution is severe at the present stage/ in big cities like Beijing, Tianjin always pollution haze.\u201d  Wang said he wanted to offer western listeners a more nuanced picture of his country than he believed international media were providing. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly aware of the good things and also the bad things about China. We are trying hard to change the bad things,\u201d he said. This is China \u2013 which has been shared more than 40,000 times on social media since being released on Tuesday \u2013 shows more affection for law enforcement than is customary for gangsta rappers.  \u201cWe can trust public security cuz the policemen are kind to citizens but crucial to our enemies,\u201d the MCs rap, adding: \u201cWe have tight gun control laws and we don\u2019t fear gun slaughtering.\u201d             However, CD Rev\u2019s pre-Communist party raps are less polite. One track called The Force of Red contains a vicious attack on Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan\u2019s first female president, who took office last month vowing to reduce the self-ruled island\u2019s dependence on Beijing. Other tracks have made homophobic attacks on the western media and journalists. Wu Dezu, the head of the Communist Youth League production company behind This is China, defended the decision to hire the group. He said the thoughts expressed in their latest rap were representative of how young Chinese felt about their country, adding: \u201cAnd their rap skills and artistic performance are great too.\u201d  Wu admitted that some of CD Rev\u2019s earlier compositions had contained \u201cemotional\u201d passages but said: \u201cWe\u2019ve all been young.\u201d  Wang said his nationalist band \u2013 whose other members are Li Yijie (aka Pissy), Tan Yunwen (aka N.O.G) and Luo Jinhui (aka Roy) \u2013 had produced 10 tracks since it was formed on 1 October 2015 to coincide with the anniversary of the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic of China. The group are now preparing to release their debut album.  Asked how much the Communist Youth League had paid for the pro-Beijing rap, Wang laughed. \u201cNot much. But I can\u2019t tell you the exact amount.\u201d  He conceded that some of the group\u2019s lyrics were \u201ca little bit aggressive\u201d but said western rap was also awash with \u201cvulgar words\u201d. He said: \u201cLots of the words we learned from American rappers.\u201d  The use of gangsta rap to boost China\u2019s international image is an unusual step for the image-obsessed Communist party, which reportedly spends $10bn (\u00a37.5bn) each year attempting to push Beijing\u2019s views in foreign media outlets.  Last year, the ministry of culture banned 120 songs that allegedly \u201ctrumpeted obscenity, violence, crime or harmed social morality\u201d, almost half of which were by rappers from China and Taiwan..

Many of its biggest investments, such as Taiwan Semiconductors, have barely moved during the crisis affecting Britain. Meanwhile Terry Smith\u2019s Fundsmith Equity fund climbed 8%, as its largely US-focused portfolio benefited from the fall in sterling. But savers with money in Artemis Income, a \u00a35.9bn fund, lost 2.9% of their cash. Its second-biggest investment is Lloyds Bank, which plummeted in price from 72p a share before the referendum result to 51p afterwards. It has since stumbled back to around 55p, but like other UK banks it remains substantially below its pre-Brexit high.    Many small investors are embracing volatility rather than running away from it    Fund managers are massively split over the impact that Brexit will have in the future. In the more sanguine corner is Neil Woodford, whose Income fund is up 0.4% since the result emerged. \u201cMy view is the economic path for the UK economy, and indeed for the global economy, will be uninterrupted, broadly, over the long term by what has happened,\u201d he says. \u201cI think with the benefit of a bit of time and a bit of distance, people will take a more measured view of what\u2019s really happening in the world economy. Our view is this doesn\u2019t really change anything fundamental. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if we\u2019ve got this rosy view of the outlook at all,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe\u2019ve been cautious for a long time. What happens next for the world economy is that growth continues to slow \u2026 that has to be a headwind for corporate profits. Commodity prices, I think, will remain weak. I don\u2019t expect a recession here in the UK. It may seem a bit controversial, because a lot of people are forecasting recession. This is not just a narrow UK-centric thing. This is profoundly important for the whole of Europe, and for the eurozone project, and the EU project. \u201cI believe the centralising influence from Brussels, the sort of ever-closer union it advocates, is going to be in retreat now across Europe.\u201d Smith is also relaxed about the impact of Brexit. \u201cThe average Fundsmith portfolio company was founded in 1912. They have survived two world wars, the great depression and the financial crisis of 2008-09, so we are confident that Brexit will not lead to their demise, as the performance post-Brexit tends to demonstrate.\u201d But plenty of other managers are predicting a recession and further falls in sterling.      Prudential, which manages \u00a3150bn, says: \u201cWe should all plan for a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit scenario.\u201d Investment director Andy Brown believes the referendum result \u201cchanges the investment climate significantly. While the UK will continue to operate within the EU, as the government brokers an exit deal, there are considerable uncertainties regarding business investment and consumer confidence. This is likely to bring further sterling vulnerability \u2026 while economic growth could fall sharply to between 0% and 1% during the period of renegotiation. The global economy remains fragile, and a global recession could be sparked by any number of more immediate factors. Prolonged and pronounced market stress could have adverse wealth effects, impact confidence and result in tighter financial conditions globally. \u201cMarket stress could also result in a substantive and disorderly reversal of capital flows from emerging markets, putting pressure on more vulnerable economies. Heavily indebted emerging markets could face a wave of corporate/financial defaults. Similarly, a hard landing in China, especially if accompanied by moves to aggressively weaken the renminbi, could result in deflationary pressures in advanced economies at a point when they have less policy space to deal with the issue.\u201d There is some evidence that small investors went \u201cbargain hunting\u201d for stocks that were hit hardest immediately after the result became apparent. Russ Mould, investment director at broker AJ Bell, says many small investors are \u201cembracing volatility rather than running away from it\u201d, with buy orders for banks and housebuilders far exceeding sells. Fund advisers say it\u2019s too early to say the panic is over. \u201cIt would be premature to call the bottom of the market \u2013 prices are still adjusting to the post-Brexit world,\u201d says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cIt would be foolhardy to rule out further price swings. The bounce in the Footsie does show there are buyers out there who are swooping in when prices fall sufficiently, but markets neither go up or down in a straight line, and things may yet have to get worse before they get better. \u201cValuations on the UK stock market look in the middle of their historical range, which suggests it\u2019s a reasonable time to put money in the market if you are a long-term investor. But given the current volatility, you need to be willing to stomach further price falls if you are dipping a toe in.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jul/05/four-rules-of-airport-style-fashion", "publicationDate": "2016-07-05T10:03:50Z", "tags": ["Fashion", "Selena Gomez", "Rihanna", "Victoria Beckham", "Women's coats and jackets", "Life and style"], "sentences": ["2) Remind the public of your USP     Jaden Smith leaves a Taiwan airport on a scooter.", "Think Jaden Smith at a Taiwanese airport in all black athleisure riding on his suitcase-cum-scooter hybrid, or Lady Gaga in Alexander McQueen hoof shoe-boots, handcuffs attached to underpants and grey hair (with the tips dyed rainbow colours) at LAX."], "title": "The four rules of airport style", "article": "In the pin heart centre of the noughties, celebrity culture hit a nuclear phase. PerezHilton.com, TMZ and Grazia all launched. Heat magazine hit sales of 500,000 in 2004. With the increased vigilance of celebrities, paparazzi focused more attention on airports, chiefly Los Angeles International airport (LAX).  The manicured eye of the celebrity stylist took note and the concept of \u201cairport style\u201d was born. No longer able to get away with bleary eyes, Uggs and a crumpled hoodie, the airport ascended to become a sort of virtual runway. \u201cIt\u2019s a more accessible take on street style,\u201d Hillary Kerr, co-founder of Who What Wear, told Racked. \u201cFor the most part, the pieces are simple, easy. It\u2019s staples that most women have in their closet just combined in an interesting way.\u201d  Here are the most significant lessons to learn from celebrity airport style. 1) Dress as if everyone is watching     Lily Aldridge at LAX in pyjamas. Photograph: GVK/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images    Celebrities, they\u2019re not just like us! Witness: Gigi Hadid robing in a fur-lined coat at Toronto\u2019s Pearson International airport; Lily Aldridge sauntering in a pyjama two-piece with a geometric pattern; and Amal Clooney walking through Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport in a rainbow-hued Missoni dress. Looking sleek and frow-ready is a new normal for celebrities who get their travel-size toiletries shipped in from Oscar de la Renta. 2) Remind the public of your USP     Jaden Smith leaves a Taiwan airport on a scooter. Photograph: TPG/Getty Images    For mere mortals, eccentricity should be underplayed at the airport (especially in the queue for passport control). For lawless celebrities, though, it\u2019s a place where you can let your freak flag fly. Think Jaden Smith at a Taiwanese airport in all black athleisure riding on his suitcase-cum-scooter hybrid, or Lady Gaga in Alexander McQueen hoof shoe-boots, handcuffs attached to underpants and grey hair (with the tips dyed rainbow colours) at LAX. A cynical interpretation is that it\u2019s the psychedelic breadcrumb trail that leads to their latest single release or fragrance launch. On a more practical level, the question to be asked is: \u201cHow are you going to get that through security, babes?\u201d 3) Try out a new style     Selena Gomez at LAX in a Vetements hoodie and matching tracksuit bottoms. Photograph: GVK/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images    Selena Gomez has brokered her transformation from Disney ingenue to creamy smooth pop icon goddess via fashion. She has worn Lagerfeld at concerts, the merch for her Revival tour includes very on-trend items including tattoo kits, athleisure sports bras, and sewn-on patches, and she is featured in the Vuitton campaign. Perhaps the biggest indicator, though, is the fact that she wore a Vetements hoodie when walking through the airport. An all-red tracksuit that was a take on Champion\u2019s hoodie and a chance for Gomez to signify a hip outsiderdom.  4) Wear your own merchandise     Victoria Beckham at LAX dressed in Victoria Beckham. Photograph: Broadimage/REX Shutterstock    For a celebrity who is almost certainly going to be photographed, this is a win-win move. What better way to show off your personal wares than by using yourself as your own model? Witness: Victoria Beckham strolling through the departures terminal clad head to toe in next season\u2019s Victoria Beckham art deco-styled gown; or Kanye West, having just landed, dressed in Yeezy Season 3 shoes and a Yeezus hoodie. It\u2019s a me-wearing-me-being-photographed-wearing-me moment, which scores a good 9 on the meta scale.

The undoubted star of the show for the company is crime writer Arnaldur Indri\u00f0ason, author of the Detective Erlendur series.  J\u00f3hannsson said: \u201cThere are also dozens of other authors doing well, locally and internationally, but Arnaldur is the one that stands out. He, I would say, is one of Scandinavia\u2019s best crime authors and has been a huge hit \u2026 he has sold over 12m copies worldwide at this point. \u201d Also of international interest, Johannson said, is Andri Sn\u00e6r Magnason: \u201cHe has been getting a lot of interest, partly because he was running for president of Iceland \u2026 His book, The Story of The Blue Planet, has been translated into 30 languages. Then I must mention Lilja Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir. Her crime novel who was a bestseller in Iceland last year is getting a lot of attention from international publishers.\u201d  Although Forlagi\u00f0 puts out a wide range of books, it majors in fiction \u2013 and that\u2019s what the foreign publishers are looking for, said J\u00f3hannsson. \u201cEspecially titles that are very \u2018Icelandic\u2019, so the reader can in a way feel how Iceland and Icelanders are.\u201d  While BBC football presenter Gary Lineker observed that there were more volcanoes in Iceland than professional footballers, that\u2019s not true of would-be writers. The population, of just under 330,000, is full of wannabe writers.  \u201cThere is a saying in Iceland that every Icelander has either written a book or wants to write a book,\u201d said J\u00f3hannsson. \u201cSo yes, the literary scene in Iceland is extremely lively. We get a new Icelandic manuscript on average every day, and that\u2019s just us \u2013 there are over 100 publishers active in the Icelandic market every year.  \u201cOur heritage mainly comes from writing, in the Sagas, and we have had a lot of quality writers over the years, including one Nobel prize-winner\u201d. (Halld\u00f3r Laxness won the Nobel prize in literature in 1955 for a huge body of work including novels, short stories, journalism and poetry).

An international tribunal in The Hague overwhelmingly backed the Philippines in a case on the disputed waters of the South China Sea, ruling that rocky outcrops claimed by China - some of which are exposed only at low tide \u2013 cannot be used as the basis of territorial claims. It said some of the waters in question are \u201cwithin the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines, because those areas are not overlapped by any possible entitlement of China\u201d. The tribunal furthermore found that China had violated the Philippines\u2019 sovereign rights in those waters by interfering with its fishing and petroleum exploration and by constructing artificial islands.  Why is that important? Control of the South China Sea is the most contentious and explosive diplomatic issue in east Asia, with China asserting sovereignty over maritime areas that span 3.5m square kilometres but are also claimed by Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Japan. Washington has become deeply involved, backing those against China and conducting military patrols. Although the case was raised by the Philippines, it will affect all these countries as it effectively punches a series of holes in China\u2019s all-encompassing \u201cnine-dash\u201d demarcation line, a dotted marker in Chinese maps that stretches deep into the South China Sea. It effectively declares large areas of the sea to be neutral international waters. The South China Sea is thought to have significant oil and gas reserves and is a route for about $4.5tn (\u00a33.4tn) in trade. There are giant fisheries and lanes for half of all commercial shipping. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has vowed to \u201cresolutely defend\u201d his country\u2019s interests in the region.   South China Sea locator   The lead up to the ruling was fraught. China\u2019s foreign minister called the US secretary of state, John Kerry, by telephone last week and warned against moves that infringe on China\u2019s sovereignty. And Beijing conducted military drills, deploying at least two guided missile destroyers and a missile frigate. Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) thinktank in Washington, said a ruling that questioned or rejected China\u2019s \u201cnine-dash line\u201d would not invalidate all of Beijing\u2019s claims to land or maritime zones in the South China Sea. \u201c[But] it would really limit the amount of water that the Chinese could have any legal sovereignty claim to. Who made the judgment? The Philippines raised the case in 2013 in a five-judge permanent court of arbitration in The Hague, arguing that Beijing\u2019s claim violated UN conventions. Beijing has rejected the court\u2019s authority to rule on the case and has also attempted to discredit its work as biased by pointing to the fact that a judge from China\u2019s regional rival Japan was involved in its creation.  What has been happening in the meantime? China has upped activities in the South China Sea in recent months to further entrench its presence in the region. It has used dredging ships to pour sand on coral reefs and turn them into islands. On these islands the Chinese military has installed missile launchers, runways, barracks and other security facilities. The court was asked to investigate whether these reclaimed areas are indeed considered \u201cislands\u201d under international law, which are granted exclusive economic zones. The Philippines said many should be considered \u201crocks\u201d. The UN Convention of the Law of the Sea normally stipulates a 200 nautical mile zone of the coast for economic exclusivity. But China claims 90% of the area, a much larger zone. The Philippines refers to the area of the South China Sea that it controls as the West Philippine Sea. Manila has welcomed former second world war enemy Japan to conduct joint military exercises and also former coloniser United States to land fighter jets in the archipelago nation. How is China likely to react? Experts are divided on how China will react to the verdict. Some believe China could push back aggressively if the court comes down firmly against its interests. China reacted angrily to the verdict in the immediate aftermath. Xinhua, the country\u2019s official news agency, hit out at what it described as an \u201cill-founded\u201d ruling that was \u201cnaturally null and void\u201d. China has long argued its sovereignty to the area under the \u201cnine-dash line\u201d, in which its vessels sailed as far back as the Han dynasty 2,000 years ago. Possible forms of retaliation include landing fighter jets on airstrips Beijing has built in disputed areas, declaring an air defence identification zone, or ADIZ, over the South China Sea or kicking off a dredging campaign at Scarborough Shoal, which is claimed by both the Philippines and China.  There is a precedent for violence. During the 1970s and 1980s, China and Vietnam used force several times, resulting in dozens of deaths and several sunken ships. Glaser, the CSIS expert, said she believed Beijing would seek to avoid \u201cdestabilising actions\u201d, particularly with China set to host the G20 in September. \u201cThey are just dead set on having a successful meeting \u2026 it is Xi Jinping\u2019s reputation at stake,\u201d she said.  \u201c[But] there is the potential that things go the other direction and that is that the Chinese think that they are being bullied, they are being victimised and that the party must defend China\u2019s sovereignty and every inch of China\u2019s territory. In which case we could see some rather provocative moves.  \u201cThe notion that they might start landing fighters \u2026 would really escalate tensions between the US and China and make the region very nervous.\u201d Ashley Townshend, a fellow at the University of Sydney\u2019s United States Studies Centre, said he believed Beijing would seek a \u201cmiddle path: a way to not capitulate but also a way to not escalate\u201d.  That would probably involve continuing to conduct military exercises in the region as a way of showing strength without further inflaming tensions.  \u201cChina has tended in this context [of the South China Sea] to seize the initiative when it views an opportunity and it hasn\u2019t tended to push ahead when it meets opposition,\u201d Townshend said.  How will the Philippines react?  Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines\u2019 newly elected president, has left experts guessing as to how he might respond to a ruling that is likely to be in his country\u2019s favour. \u201cThe Philippines is a completely unknown quanity here. We just don\u2019t know what Duterte is going to do,\u201d said Glaser. \u201cHe\u2019s a wild card.\u201d Duterte has vowed to ride a jet ski into disputed areas of the South China Sea in defiance of Beijing. But it is also possible that he will seek to minimise the court\u2019s ruling in order to improve ties with China. Duterte has backed multilateral talks to settle the row. Closer relations with Beijing would give Manila access to Chinese loans and much needed investment in infrastructure, and could also help ease tensions in the region. Who has China got on its side? Russia has backed Beijing\u2019s position that direct talks should take place.  And portraying itself as the victim of a US conspiracy to contain its rise, Beijing has scoured the globe for supporters in its case, no matter how disconnected they might be from the subject. In late May the foreign ministry in Beijing said Vanuatu, Lesotho and Palestine had joined its side. \u201cCountries that harbour no selfish interests and understand the South China Sea sympathise with and endorse China\u2019s just position on this issue,\u201d spokesperson Hua Chunying said.  Townshend said China had good historical reasons to be concerned about \u201cmore powerful external countries ganging up on it and telling it what it is entitled to do and not do\u201d. \u201c[But] it is very difficult for China to play the victim card when you look at the scale and speed and content of what it has built and put on the islands.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/south-china-sea-ruling-may-increase-risk-of-conflict", "publicationDate": "2016-07-12T12:21:58Z", "tags": ["China", "Xi Jinping", "Philippines", "United Nations", "US foreign policy", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["As the dispute intensified, all these countries, in common with Japan and Taiwan, have been steadily reinforcing their military-to-military relationships with the US."], "title": "South China Sea ruling was aimed at easing tension - but may just stoke conflict", "article": "By taking its case to the UN\u2019s arbitration court in The Hague, the Philippines government hoped to find a peaceful, internationally acceptable solution to its long-running maritime dispute with China, its vastly more powerful neighbour. But Tuesday\u2019s ruling, largely backing Manila and rejecting Beijing\u2019s claims to exclusive control of large parts of the South China Sea, may do the exact opposite, stoking regional tensions, drawing in the US and Japan, and increasing the risk of armed confrontation.   The possible trigger for such an escalation is China\u2019s refusal to accept the authority and jurisdiction of the UN court, and its instant rejection of its findings, despite the fact Beijing is a signatory of the UN\u2019s convention on the law of the sea, which the court oversees, and is a permanent member of the UN security council. This attempt by Beijing to cherry-pick which treaties and rules it follows poses a significant challenge to the supremacy of international law and the UN system, of which it, in theory, is a key guardian. Its supporters will argue it is only following the US example.  That Chinese officials and state media pre-empted the court ruling over a period of months before the verdict, disparaging the court and proclaiming its proceedings null and void, suggests a disturbing new doctrine of Chinese exceptionalism may be emerging under the muscular tutelage of Xi Jinping, China\u2019s authoritarian president. The irony should not be lost on the US, which justified its 20th-century global expansion in terms of exceptionalism and now finds itself on the receiving end.  China\u2019s island-building across the South China Sea has been exclusive, unapologetic, rapid and brazen. It has barely bothered to disguise its plans to create new facts on the (new) ground, including naval, air force and missiles bases. It has busily employed its soft-power influence, for example as a major lender and investor in developing countries, to face down possible criticism. And it has produced supposedly authentic, ancient documents supporting its dubious claims, behaving much like a dodgy auctioneer trying to pass off a fake oil painting as an Old Master.  Chinese propaganda noisily rejected the court\u2019s findings even before they were made public. Its drive to whip up diplomatic support in advance in places as distant as Lesotho and Palestine suggests Beijing knows very well, privately, that its attempt, in effect, to annex most of the South China Sea has scant historical, legal or moral justification. Generally speaking, the louder a government shouts, the bigger its lies.  The Philippines, under the maverick leadership of its newly elected president, Rodrigo Duterte, might appear to be first in the firing line as China looks for ways to give concrete expression to its deep displeasure. Manila thought long and hard about the possible adverse consequences of bearding its giant neighbour before bringing the case in 2013.  China\u2019s provocative efforts to bar Philippines vessels from Scarborough Shoal, generally considered to be located within the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone, and its lack of seriousness over finding a diplomatic solution through bilateral talks meant Benigno Aquino, Duterte\u2019s predecessor, had little choice but to seek redress, whatever the cost.  In doing so, Manila became unofficial standard-bearer for others in the region, including Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, all of which dispute China\u2019s \u201cnine-dash line\u201d encompassing 90% of the South China Sea\u2019s fisheries, strategic shipping lanes and untapped energy resources. As the dispute intensified, all these countries, in common with Japan and Taiwan, have been steadily reinforcing their military-to-military relationships with the US. Washington sent a powerful naval force to the area before The Hague ruling and has mounted numerous patrols to maintain freedom of navigation in what it and they view as international waters.   Thus the principal object of China\u2019s ire may turn out to be not the Philippines, whose protestations it feels it can safely ignore, but rather the US, the military superpower that binds regional nations together in a potential anti-Beijing coalition. State media have already been complaining about a US-led conspiracy, while officials from Xi down have made clear their grim determination to defend what they define as Chinese sovereignty and territory, with force if necessary.  It is possible Xi may back off, even at the risk of losing face. As host of September\u2019s G20 meeting, he may opt not to further inflame international opinion. But it is also possible he may choose to sink or swim \u2013 escalating, for example, by stationing advanced combat aircraft on the artificial islands he has built or declaring unilateral air and sea exclusion zones.  Facing unquantifiable challenges at home arising from China\u2019s economic slowdown and growing public dissatisfaction with Communist party incompetence and corruption, it may suit Xi to generate some kind of bogus national emergency, tightening his grip on power by exaggerating external threats. The risks inherent in such a course of action, on land and sea, are only too obvious.

The judgment by an international tribunal in The Hague came down overwhelmingly in favour of claims by the Philippines and is likely to increase global diplomatic pressure on Beijing to scale back military expansion in the area. By depriving certain outcrops of territorial-generating status, the ruling from the permanent court of arbitration effectively punches holes in China\u2019s all-encompassing \u201cnine-dash\u201d line that stretches deep into the South China Sea.   South China Sea atom   The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, said China\u2019s \u201cterritorial sovereignty and marine rights\u201d in the seas would not be affected by the ruling, which declared large areas of the sea to be neutral international waters or the exclusive economic zones of other countries. He insisted China was still \u201ccommitted to resolving disputes\u201d with its neighbours. Chinese state media reacted angrily to the verdict. Xinhua, the country\u2019s official news agency, hit out at what it described as an \u201cill-founded\u201d ruling that was \u201cnaturally null and void\u201d. The Communist party mouthpiece newspaper the People\u2019s Daily said in an editorial that the tribunal had ignored \u201cbasic truths\u201d and \u201ctrampled\u201d on international laws and norms.  \u201cThe Chinese government and the Chinese people firmly oppose [the ruling] and will neither acknowledge it nor accept it,\u201d it added. The Philippine foreign affairs secretary, Perfecto Yasay Jr, said the country welcomed the ruling and called for \u201crestraint and sobriety\u201d. The US State Department called on both parties to comply with their obligations, according to a statement from spokesman John Kirby. The ruling makes grim reading for Beijing and contains a series of criticisms of China\u2019s actions and claims. The tribunal declared that \u201calthough Chinese navigators and fishermen, as well as those of other states, had historically made use of the islands in the South China Sea, there was no evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive control over the waters or their resources. \u201cThe tribunal concluded that there was no legal basis for China to claim historic rights to resources within the sea areas falling within the \u2018nine-dash line\u2019.\u201d    South China Sea claims map   None of the fiercely disputed Spratly Islands, the UN body found, were \u201ccapable of generating extended maritime zones \u2026 [and] having found that none of the features claimed by China was capable of generating an exclusive economic zone, the tribunal found that it could \u2014 without delimiting a boundary \u2014 declare that certain sea areas are within the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines, because those areas are not overlapped by any possible entitlement of China.\u201d The tribunal found that China had violated the Philippines\u2019 sovereign rights in its exclusive economic zone by interfering with Philippine fishing and petroleum exploration, constructing artificial islands and failing to prevent Chinese fishermen from fishing in the zone. At Scarborough Shoal, where it said fishermen from the Philippines and China had traditional fishing rights, it said China had restricted these rights. It added that China had created a serious risk of collision when its patrol boats had physically obstructed Philippine fishing vessels.   Related: South China Sea dispute: what you need to know about The Hague court ruling    The tribunal also condemned China\u2019s land reclamation projects and its construction of artificial islands at seven features in the Spratly Islands, concluding that it had caused \u201csevere harm to the coral reef environment and violated its obligation to preserve and protect fragile ecosystems and the habitat of depleted, threatened, or endangered species\u201d.  Land reclamation \u201cwas incompatible with the obligations on a state during dispute resolution proceedings\u201d, it added, since it involved causing \u201cirreparable harm to the marine environment\u201d, building a \u201clarge artificial island in the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone\u201d, and destroying \u201cevidence of the natural condition of features in the South China Sea that formed part of the parties\u2019 dispute\u201d. Paul Reichler, of the law firm Foley Hoag LLP, who who coordinated the Philippines\u2019 legal team, said: \u201cThe tribunal\u2019s ruling not only benefits the Philippines, it also benefits other states bordering the South China Sea like Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. If China\u2019s nine-dash line is invalid as to the Philippines, it is equally invalid to those states and, indeed, the rest of the international community.\u201d     Image from a US Navy surveillance aircraft purportedly shows Chinese dredging vessels in the waters around Mischief reef in the disputed Spratly islands. Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters    Beijing claims 90% of the South China Sea, a maritime region believed to hold a wealth of untapped oil and gas reserves and through which roughly $4.5tn of ship-borne trade passes every year. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also contest China\u2019s claims to islands and reef systems closer to their territory than Beijing\u2019s. China says it follows a historical precedent set by the \u201cnine-dash line\u201d that Beijing drew in 1947 following the surrender of Japan. The line has been included in subsequent maps issued under Communist rule. Sporadic violence between Chinese vessels and those of south-east Asia militaries have broken out in recent decades and the verdict, the first international legal decision on the issue, could have unpredictable consequences. Ashley Townshend, a scholar at the University of Sydney\u2019s United States Studies Centre, said the tribunal\u2019s decision to disqualify China\u2019s \u201cnine-dash\u201d claim on the basis of historic rights was \u201ca huge setback for Beijing\u201d. China had stirred up so much nationalism over the South China Sea issue that it would now have to respond in some way.   Related: 'We won't have to live in fear anymore' : readers on the South China Sea ruling    \u201cIn terms of China\u2019s domestic politics [the ruling] is unacceptable to the regime and unfortunately the regime will perceive that the Chinese people view that as unacceptable,\u201d Townshend predicted. \u201cSo there will be huge pressures on Beijing to respond, to save face, to demonstrate with more than just words that it doesn\u2019t abide by and doesn\u2019t credit the ruling with any legal validity and will not adhere to it and will defend its \u2018sovereign space\u2019 in the South China Sea.\u201d Townshend said he did not expect Beijing to lash out militarily but believed further military drills in the South China Sea were possible as well as the establishment of an air defence identification zone somewhere over the region.  Xu Liping, a pro-Beijing scholar from China\u2019s National Institute of International Strategy, told the Guardian he believed the ruling was \u201cbiased and unfair\u201d, \u201cabsolutely terrible\u201d and \u201ca joke\u201d.  The nationalistic Global Times tabloid attacked the ruling in an English language editorial on Tuesday night as \u201cmore radical and shameless than many people had ever expected\u201d, saying it had \u201cbrazenly violated China\u2019s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights.\u201d The newspaper, which is controlled by the Communist party and sometimes reflects its thinking, also warned of a military escalation. \u201cIf the US and Japan use [the ruling] to pile military and political pressure on Beijing, Chinese people will firmly support our government to launch a tit-for-tat counterpunch,\u201d it said. \u201cWe trust Chinese law enforcement and military forces have been well-prepared.\u201d The case at the permanent court of arbitration in The Hague, the UN-appointed tribunal that adjudicates in international disputes over maritime territory, has been running since 2013. Philippe Sands QC, who represented the Philippines in the hearing, said: \u201cThis is the most significant international legal case for almost the past 20 years since the Pinochet judgment.\u201d The judgment does not allocate any of the outcrops or islands to rival countries but instead indicates which maritime features are capable under international law of generating territorial rights over surrounding seas.  Last year, US officials claimed the Chinese had built up an extra 800 hectares (2,000 acres) on their occupied outposts across the South China Sea over the previous 18 months. The main focus of activity has been on Mischief Reef, where satellite images reveal the island is growing bigger, and is surrounded by fleets of dredgers and tankers. China has previously stated that it \u201cwill neither accept nor participate in the arbitration unilaterally initiated by the Philippines\u201d. The tribunal ruled, however, that China\u2019s refusal to participate did not deprive the court of jurisdiction.

Related: Premier League pre-season 2016: a full list of all the clubs\u2019 friendlies    One extraordinary title win later Leicester\u2019s summer horizons have widened to a once almost unimaginable degree. Suddenly Europe\u2019s elite are queueing up for dates with Claudio Ranieri\u2019s players, whose opponents now include Paris Saint-Germain in Carson, California, and Barcelona in Stockholm. Such fixtures comprise part of the 2016 International Champions Cup, a pre-season extravaganza organised by the New York-based promoters Relevent Sports designed to delight merchandising departments, branding experts and commercial lawyers specialising in television rights. Staged in 16 host cities spanning Australia, China, the United States and Europe, it involves the Premier League\u2019s elite competing in separate mini-tournaments embracing assorted world zones. Whereas Tottenham play in the Australian arm \u2013 with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Juventus and Melbourne Victory \u2013 Manchester City and Manchester United join Borussia Dortmund in the China edition. This latter section facilitates the reunion of those old friends Pep Guardiola and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as the new managers of City and United find themselves renewing old acquaintance on the touchline at Beijing\u2019s Bird\u2019s Nest stadium in what will be the first Manchester derby to be staged outside the UK. Meanwhile Antonio Conte tries Mourinho\u2019s old Chelsea tracksuit for size in the American and European sector, where the former Italy coach\u2019s new team face Liverpool at Pasadena\u2019s Rose Bowl, Real Madrid in Ann Arbor and Milan in Minneapolis. Like Leicester, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool find themselves playing in both the United States and Europe, where a Wembley meeting with Barcelona almost counts as a \u201chome\u201d fixture for the Merseyside club. With games involving Premier League sides being televised from Albania to Argentina, Belarus to Burma, Canada to Kosovo, Taiwan to Thailand, Iceland to India and Malta to Malaysia, it is big business. Football-wise few managers will take too much notice of the results (although Guardiola and Mourinho would doubtless prefer to emerge victorious in the Bird\u2019s Nest) but, commercially, these matches are anything but meaningless as clubs strive to win hearts and minds while establishing toeholds in far-flung markets. Two years ago, an 110,000 crowd saw Manchester United play Real Madrid in Michigan in a pre-season fixture, setting a record attendance for watching a football match in the United States. This probably explains why, striving to \u201ccrack America\u201d, nine Premier League teams are crossing the Atlantic this summer. With the once almost inexorable pulling power of east Asia apparently waning as clubs realise profits are far too easily debilitated by \u201cpiracy\u201d in markets flooded by fake football merchandise, crossing \u201cthe pond\u201d is the thing to do.     Leicester City played their preparation matches for last season in England. Here Jamie Vardy, left, is seen in action at Mansfield Town. Photograph: JMP/Rex/Shutterstock    Unless you are Sam Allardyce, of course. After seeing his former West Ham squad drained by flying to New Zealand two summers ago, Sunderland\u2019s manager urged Ellis Short, the club\u2019s American owner, to allow the team to remain in Europe this summer. With the complaints of Dick Advocaat, Allardyce\u2019s predecessor, about the ruinous effects of playing three games in North America and Canada in eight seemingly exhausting days last summer probably still echoing in his ears, Short took heed. Although Sunderland will visit the New York Stadium it is the one in Rotherham. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to us that we don\u2019t travel too far so we\u2019re staying in Europe,\u201d says Allardyce who is taking his squad to France and Austria. \u201cGoing around the world \u2013 flying to places like America \u2013 isn\u2019t right for any team to be doing when you\u2019re building up to another massive season in the Premier League. Staying in Europe enables us to get the players as fit as we possibly can.\u201d Allardyce and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger rarely agree but it is safe to assume they are united on this issue. For many years Arsenal\u2019s manager managed to restrict his squad\u2019s summer travel to Austria but recently even he has bowed to commercial pressures and is duly preparing for a couple of games in California. Indeed managerial concerns about the draining effect of long-haul flying and constantly switching time zones tend to be eclipsed by the reality that marquee names such as Manchester United or Liverpool are able to charge upwards of \u00a31m to appear in certain pre-season games overseas. This explains not only why Wenger\u2019s \u201cresistance movement\u201d has faltered but why in the 10 years to 2014 Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool played 319 senior first XI pre-season matches with only 97 staged in England. No one seems overly bothered about depriving domestic fans of the chance to get first glimpses of new signings and see how tactics are shaping up as another campaign approaches. Tellingly, just two Premier League clubs \u2013 Middlesbrough and Watford \u2013 are restricting their friendly action to games in England this summer. Many Premier League counterparts flying to China or California \u2013 let alone Australia \u2013 would gladly swap summer schedules with Aitor Karanka\u2019s players. Instead they can only glance enviously at international team-mates afforded extra time off following Euro 2016. The absence of some stellar names \u2013 although everyone hopes Zlatan Ibrahimovic is back in time to make his Manchester United debut against Galatasaray in Gothenburg at the end of this month \u2013 dictates overseas fans will simply have to content themselves buying into the ever-burgeoning cult of the manager. That possibly explains why Manchester City could not resist shoehorning a detour to Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s Bayern Munich in en route to China, allowing Guardiola to make his bow against the club he has just left. Then it\u2019s on to Beijing\u2019s Bird\u2019s Nest and Mr Mourinho.

It means small countries like the Philippines and Vietnam who are often bullied by China can still believe in world justice and international law. We live in the 21st century, not in he Middle Ages when China thought it was the centre of the world. As part of a civilized world, we cannot accept a power who has acted in contradiction and has wanted to use force to impose the rule over the South China Sea.  Do not listen to what the Chinese government says. Do they really want peace, stability, prosperity for the region or do they want supremacy? Vietnam and the Philippines just want peace for their own prosperity and development. In short, the ruling means victory of international law over the outlaws, and honesty over dishonesty in the world of politics.

Some ASEAN members (including the Philippines and Vietnam) are directly involved, whereas others (Cambodia and Laos) have no direct interest in the ruling, but will experience strong pressure from Beijing to support its claims.

We\u2019ve been fighting this for a long time. It\u2019s a big deal for a small country like the Philippines to challenge a big country like China and I\u2019m really proud of this. This could also give countries like Vietnam and Taiwan, who are also having territory disputes with China, all the more reason not to back down now that the international court has backed the Philippines.  While I\u2019m happy we won this case I\u2019m also worried about our relations with China. There are plenty of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) in China and I fear that they will be affected by this ruling. I\u2019ve heard that trading has been affected as well; some parts of China have boycotted our banana exports because of this dispute. As China has refused to recognize the tribunal, the court decision might not completely mean a happy ending for us. I\u2019d say yes to aggression, but this may lead to war, which I admit is something we cannot afford right now.  With all the little wars we have had to deal with in our country alone, being aggressive towards China is too big of a risk. We\u2019re not powerful enough to do that as much as I hate to admit it. The people are divided; some want to negotiate with China, and some want them completely out of the picture. This would also cause some countries to take sides and that would not be pretty. The worst case scenario is that this entire dispute will spark a war. We don\u2019t want that. The bottom line is that this ruling affects me in both good and bad ways.

Lauw, 20, Indonesia \u2018This will only further provoke China\u2019 Personally, I feel uncomfortable rather than angered by the action of the Philippines. Unlike the absolute majority of my Chinese compatriots, I consider that the Philippines has some reasonable grounds for its claims. Nevertheless, bringing the case to the Court in Hague for arbitration at this time is a stupid move: the Chinese government has been putting up a nationalist rhetoric for so long while the absolute majority of Chinese people buy this rhetoric.  The Philippines and its allies must have already known that China would never accept this judgment under the current situation. On the contrary, in any short term, this action would only further provoke China and make China further victimize and isolate itself from the region and even from the rest of the world.

The new leader of the Philippines is unpredictable and Japan is governed by a party who does whatever it wants.  The most worrying thing for me is that even the Chinese western-educated elite is blindly following what Beijing propaganda is saying, without any questioning or doubt. They are (a bit like Japan in the 80s) discovering their power and are not willing to lose face and give up any of it.

The reclamation work in the last couple of years has done a lot of damage to the delicate ecological environment, especially the coral reefs. The prospect of oil and natural gas has tempted countries around the South China Sea to grab any rock or reef they can lay their hands on and its not only China which is trying to do this. Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines are doing pretty much the same thing. But China\u2019s position in respect to its claim looks stretched at best as most of them are very far away from Hainan, the nearest Chinese territory hospitable to people.

Peter Navarro, an economics professor and adviser to the businessman, told the Guardian that Murdoch\u2019s media empire, News Corp, should be more supportive of the Republican nominee-in-waiting.   Related: Fact-check: Donald Trump on trade, globalization and the Clintons    \u201cThey represent red-blooded American conservatism. Yet the only thing that seems off-limits to them is China. They should be all over China for its economic and military aggression. But they\u2019re not. Either Rupert is pulling the strings or it\u2019s self-censorship.\u201d In a wild and unpredictable election season, Trump bashing China, and Murdoch-owned media bashing Trump, have been two constants. Navarro, author of Death by China: Confronting the Dragon \u2013 A Global Call to Action, linked one to the other, saying News Corps executives and broadcasters strived to protect their master\u2019s commercial interests.  \u201cRoger Ailes and Sean Hannity know China is important to Murdoch,\u201d he said. You didn\u2019t need to be Sherlock Holmes, said Navarro, to make a deduction about Murdoch outlets allegedly muffling coverage critical of Beijing. \u201cIt\u2019s the dog that didn\u2019t bark in the night.\u201d News Corp did not respond to a request for comment. Trump, who is due to claim the nomination at the Republican national convention in Cleveland this week, has grabbed headlines by promoting multiple conspiracy theories encompassing Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate, vaccines, New Jersey Muslims, Antonin Scalia\u2019s death and Ted Cruz\u2019s father. The most persistent, and arguably the most significant should Trump win November\u2019s election, concerns China. Again and again, the businessman has accused China of swindling and \u201craping\u201d the US, especially through trade. He has promised a radical response should he clinch the White House, including steep tariffs which could trigger a trade war. Trump\u2019s repeated references to China have inspired a mashup video viewed on YouTube more than 6m times. Navarro, who teaches economics and public policy at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), supplies academic ammunition to the Trump campaign, marshaling statistics and arguments which purportedly unmask China as the font of America\u2019s ailments.             Seated at a resort overlooking the Pacific near his home in Laguna Beach, the professor spoke after an international tribunal last week punched holes in China\u2019s attempt to extend influence in the South China Sea through an arc of strategic reefs and atolls. Navarro\u2019s accusations against Murdoch outlets inserted a sub-plot into the conventional Trumpian narrative about Chinese villainy. The Wall Street Journal, said the adviser, probably would have attacked Trump anyway since it represented a financial industry with interests in China. In California, China\u2019s growing reach is manifest in the state\u2019s proliferating number of Chinese investors and students, notably at UCI, prompting racially tinged nicknames such as the University of Chinese Immigrants and the University of Caucasian Isolation.

Photograph: Courtesy of Peter Navarro    Navarro said his warnings about China had nothing to do with race or ethnicity. \u201cIt\u2019s about a brutal, authoritarian communist government that\u2019s engaged in mercantilist enterprise, and is allowed to get away with it.\u201d Navarro said he became a pro bono adviser to the campaign several months ago after Trump cited one of his books in an interview. He said he has not met the billionaire but liaises with Stephen Miller, a senior Trump adviser on foreign and domestic policy.  Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to a query about Navarro\u2019s role.  In documentaries and books \u2013 the latest is Crouching Tiger: What China\u2019s Militarism Means for the World \u2013 Navarro has depicted China as an insatiable menace which systematically bullies, lies and cheats, especially on trade rules through currency manipulation, illegal export subsidies, intellectual property theft and polluting sweatshops. \u201cChina uses these weapons of job destruction to unfairly tilt the playing field.\u201d Bill Clinton let the chicken into the hen house by paving China\u2019s entry to the World Trade Organization in 2001, said Navarro, enabling the Asian giant to siphon US jobs, industry and growth, which in turn funded Chinese military expansion. \u201cThis is the essence of Trump\u2019s campaign. He understands this problem.\u201d Navarro endorsed Trump\u2019s use of the word rape. \u201cIt\u2019s an apt description of the damage and carnage that China\u2019s trade policies have wrought on the American economic heartland. What\u2019s happening is rapacious.\u201d Other economists, in contrast, blame US travails on a self-inflicted recession and wider globalization forces. Chinese nationals have boosted the US recovery by pouring more than $17bn into US real estate since 2010.  Regardless, Navarro endorsed Trump\u2019s proposed 45% tariffs on Chinese goods, which critics say would trigger a ruinous trade war and global slump. \u201cWe\u2019re already in a trade war with China. The problem is we\u2019ve not been fighting back. Trump, through tariffs, wants to call a truce.\u201d He called 45% \u201ca good number\u201d.   Related: Donald Trump: the making of a narcissist    Navarro said the proposed retaliation was \u201cdefensive\u201d and reflected the spirit of the founding fathers, who enacted tariffs in 1789, rather than the \u201cprotectionist\u201d tariffs of the 1930s, which worsened the depression. The hope, said Navarro, was that China would back down in the face of Trump\u2019s resolve. If not, Trump will plough ahead with the tariffs. Likewise there will be no need for Japan and South Korea to acquire nuclear weapons, or to renegotiate treaties, as long as they and other allies accept Trump\u2019s demand for \u201cfull cost sharing\u201d of defense. He accused Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, of antagonizing China with the so-called \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia only to then cripple the US navy with budget cuts, leaving the region vulnerable to Beijing muscle-flexing. Trump, in contrast, would \u201cspeak softly but carry a big stick\u201d.  Navarro said the tycoon would revive the economy with Reaganite tax cuts which would fuel economic growth, fund military expansion, intimidate foes and restore US greatness. \u201cThe whole philosophy will be peace through economic strength.\u201d The professor, who had just returned from a trip to Taiwan, at the invitation of the self-ruled island\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs,  said Trump would push China on human rights, including labour conditions. Support for waterboarding would not undercut such advocacy, he insisted. He cited Jack Bauer, the fictional TV character, as justification. \u201cThe underlying question is whether torture works. If it does, when you\u2019re confronting an enemy that beheads people and wants to put nuclear bombs in our subways, then waterboarding is well within the rules.\u201d Trump faced a backlash in March when he referred to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests as a \u201criot\u201d. Critics also pounced on a quote from 1990 in which he cited China\u2019s brutal crackdown as exhibiting the \u201cpower of strength\u201d. A recent Reuters report quoted Chinese officials saying they thought Clinton, who as secretary of state confronted Beijing, would be tougher than Trump, an unknown quantity.  \u201cWho is Trump? We don\u2019t really know,\u201d said one official with ties to the military. Beijing\u2019s crackdown on Muslim \u201cterrorists\u201d in Xinjiang region, however, suggested some common ground, said the official. \u201cWe do know he hates Muslims though \u2013 and that will be well received in some circles here.\u201d "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/19/russia-olympics-ioc-anti-doping-exclude-athletes-rio", "publicationDate": "2016-07-19T19:08:00Z", "tags": ["Russia doping scandal", "Drugs in sport", "International Olympic Committee", "Rio 2016", "Olympic Games", "Athletics", "Sport"], "sentences": ["In 1960 the People\u2019s Republic of China took a similar position on Taiwan.", "More often than not the IOC has crafted a compromise: on those occasions the Finns and the Taiwanese marched without flags.", "The 1956 Games also saw the withdrawal of China who refused to participate following the inclusion of the Republic Of China (Taiwan), following the Chinese civil war.", "The second controversy surrounded the naming dispute between the People\u2019s Republic of China (China) and the Republic of China (Taiwan).", "Taiwan withdrew after both Canada and the IOC stated that only China could compete under the name and flag of the Chinese Republic."], "title": "Russia and the Olympics: why the IOC\u2019s love of inclusion must be sacrificed", "article": "When an organisation aspires to stage a festival of universal humanity through sport it really matters that everyone is there. The boycotts of the late cold war era not only made for lopsided competition but displayed the painfully obvious truth that Olympian internationalism was a sham. Not surprisingly the International Olympic Committee has been loth to exclude athletes or nations from the Games. Of course, in the era of amateurism key individual athletes who were deemed to be professionals \u2013 usually the most visible, successful and critical of the status quo \u2013 were summarily excluded from the Games: such as the Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi in 1932 and the Austrian skier Karl Schranz in 1972. However, given that the Olympic movement had entirely colluded with the fiction of communist athletic amateurism in the East and was unable to police the surging commercialisation of sport in the West, these exclusions can be considered sanctimonious outbursts of pique rather than policy.   Related: Vladimir Putin warns of Olympic \u2018schism\u2019 after Russian doping revealed    In extremis, some pariah states were kept at arm\u2019s length. Given that the 1920 Antwerp Games were sited in the heart of the killing fields of the first world war, it was hard to make a case for the inclusion of the defeated central powers. Deftly the IOC passed the buck to the Belgian organisers who simply failed to issue invitations to the Germans, Austrians, Hungarians and Turks. A similar arrangement was availed after the second world war as well but, as North Korea\u2019s presence at the summer Games, unbroken since 1992, suggests, the Games are among the most truly inclusive of international organisations. Requests to participate from states whose sovereignty was contested have proved more troublesome. From 1952 to 1964 East Germany was required to compete as part of a United German team run from Bonn. Before the 1908 London Games the Russians were apoplectic at the prospect of their Finnish province marching under its own flag in the parade of nations. In 1960 the People\u2019s Republic of China took a similar position on Taiwan. More often than not the IOC has crafted a compromise: on those occasions the Finns and the Taiwanese marched without flags. In this regard the prospect of revoking the entire Russian Olympic Committee\u2019s invite to the Rio Games takes the IOC into new territory. In the past the organisation\u2019s preference for universalism and inclusion has trumped its commitment to gentlemanly amateurism, gossamer-thin pacifism and its embrace of universal human rights. Now it faces a trade-off with the principles of pharmacologically \u201cclean\u201d sport which Thomas Bach, the IOC president, has made a central element of his reform programme.   Banned Russian athletes   This is also old territory as the IOC has, in fact, a long record of dealing with a state-sponsored doping programme centred on Moscow. In Helsinki in 1952 the Soviet Union, at its first Olympic Games, won eight gold medals in weightlifting and wrestling, testament to both their popularity and, it soon transpired, the widespread and officially sanctioned use of the then perfectly legal testosterone. It would take the IOC until 1968 to establish a drugs-testing regime, which trialled at the Mexico City Games and caught just a single competitor \u2013 an unfortunate Swedish pentathlete who had drunk too much booze. By then testosterone had been replaced by undetectable synthetic analogue anabolic steroids and their use had become widespread, not merely in the Soviet Union but in the rest of Eastern Europe and in the United States, where as late as 1973 Ken Patera, the weightlifter, was brazen when rueing his defeat at the Munich Games by the Soviet champion Vasily Alexeyev. \u201cLast year the only difference between me and him was that I couldn\u2019t afford his drug bill. Now I can \u2026 we\u2019ll see which are better \u2013 his steroids or mine.\u201d The drug-testing regime at the Moscow 1980 Games was a case study in the IOC\u2019s naivety and the Soviet capacity for duplicity. The IOC accepted the assurances from the organisers that the laboratories and procedures established for the Games were up to scratch and when not a single athlete failed a single drugs test (from more than 8,000 of them) they revelled in the \u201cpurest\u201d Games in history. Manfred Dinke, a West German doctor on the IOC medical commission, conducted some tests of his own on the Moscow urine samples (using a new technique that he had been developing for measuring testosterone levels) and concluded 20% of them, including 16 gold medallists, should have failed. In this light Sochi 2014 and all the subsequent revelations of Russian doping policy appear a mere technological update rather than a new phenomenon, with a crumbling communist ideology exchanged for a bellicose nationalism. In another era the IOC could just turn a blind eye. When asked about the implications of the massacre of hundreds of protesters in Mexico City on the eve of the 1968 Games its president Avery Brundage could coldly reply: \u201cI was at the opera.\u201d Ignorance and indifference are not luxuries available to Bach\u2019s IOC. Olympism\u2019s commitment to environmental sustainability, human rights and social development have been almost irredeemably tarnished by the pathologies of Olympic mega-development. Having unambiguously nailed the IOC\u2019s colours to the mast of anti-doping, will this remaining vestige of Olympic values be sacrificed, too? The IOC simply must exclude the Russian Olympic Committee and its athletes from the Rio Games. Should it fail to do so, inclusivity will have trumped everything and been bought at the price of the organisation\u2019s deepest moral and political vacuity.

This led the American Jewish Congress to call for a boycott of the Games and the most prominent group of athletes who chose not to take part were those of Jewish extraction. The United States came close to a complete boycott. Many senior officials saw taking part would serve as an \u201cendorsement of Hitler\u2019s Reich\u201d and its antisemitic policies. However, a group of African-American sports writers called for black athletes to support the Games in an attempt to undermine Hitler\u2019s views on Aryan supremacy and the US team chose to compete. Thus emerged some of the most symbolic images in Olympic history, when Jesse Owens won gold in the 100m, 200m, 4x100m relay and the long jump. Melbourne 1956 In the wake of the Suez Canal crisis, Egypt, Lebanon and Iraq withdrew because of the presence of British, French and Israeli athletes. Following the end of the Hungarian revolution, Spain, the Netherlands and Switzerland all withdrew because of the presence of Soviet athletes. The 1956 Games also saw the withdrawal of China who refused to participate following the inclusion of the Republic Of China (Taiwan), following the Chinese civil war. Tokyo 1964 Although South Africa announced in June they would be including seven non-whites in their team of 62 Olympic hopefuls, the move did not go far enough for the International Olympic Committee. The IOC voted to revoke the South African Olympic Committee invitation to the 1964 Games unless it renouced the government\u2019s policy of apartheid. Sanoc failed to do so and South Africa\u2019s exclusion from the Olympic movement lasted until 1992. Munich 1972 For the first time in Olympic history the Games were suspended and were in danger of cancellation after the murder of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches in the Olympic village. The \u201cMunich massacre\u201d was led by the Palestinian movement the Black September. After much debate the decision was made to continue but many Jewish athletes, including the US swimmer Mark Spitz, either withdrew or went home early, under fear that they too might be targeted. A number of African countries considered withdrawing if Rhodesia sent a team as they did not recognise the legitimacy of the country\u2019s government. The IOC voted 36-31 to exclude Rhodesia. Montreal 1976 Many African nations, with support from Iraq, Syria and Sudan pulled out of the Games in protest over the inclusion of New Zealand who continued competitions with South Africa despite apartheid. The second controversy surrounded the naming dispute between the People\u2019s Republic of China (China) and the Republic of China (Taiwan). Taiwan withdrew after both Canada and the IOC stated that only China could compete under the name and flag of the Chinese Republic. Moscow 1980 &amp; Los Angeles 1984 The political backdrop to the boycotts of 1980 and 1984 started in December 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. The then US president Jimmy Carter threatened to withdraw American competitors from the Moscow Games if Soviet armed forces were not removed. The Soviets refused and thus began the biggest boycott in Olympic history, although ultimately many countries, including Britain, France and Australia did end up sending athletes. While governments and officials led the boycotts, the ultimate decision of whether to compete was left up to the individual athletes in many nations. A total of 59, however, did boycott the Games. Oddly, the Soviets still competed in the 1980 Winter Games held in Lake Placid but boycotted the summer Games in Los Angeles four years later, citing \u201cchauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the country\u201d. The Soviets were joined by countries in the eastern bloc and socialist and communist regimes including Vietnam and Cuba. Seoul 1988 After the events of the previous two Olympics, it was hoped that the 1988 Games would run more smoothly. Many of the countries involved in the previous boycotts had agreed to take part. However, a row over splitting the Games between North and South Korea saw the former boycott the Olympics and they were joined by Cuba, as well as Nicaragua and Ethiopia. Atlanta 1996 Atlanta was marred by the Centennial Olympic Park bombing, which claimed the lives of two people and injured 111 more. The attacker, Eric Rudolph, carried out the attack as a protest against the US government\u2019s stance on abortion. He had hoped that such an attack would cancel the Games, but as in 1972, the decision was made to continue.

The economy is expected to come under pressure, but what does this mean to the UK in terms of open data?  Could Brexit see the UK shelve or at least downsize its commitment to open data as economic uncertainty prompts more public cuts? Or will Brexit actually liberate UK open data and increase transparency, with the Government abandoning austerity in favour of public investment?  It shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted that the Theresa May era will by default embrace David Cameron\u2019s 2010 policy towards open data. The new Prime Minister may have other priorities. The early rush to publish public data sets saw the UK take the global lead in open data \u2013 it\u2019s now ranked second behind Taiwan. With data.gov.uk, a single website for UK public data, launching in 2010 and Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Sir Nigel Shadbolt founding the Open Data Institute (ODI) in 2012, the UK was taking positive steps to creating a strong open data culture, but being world champions in this field doesn\u2019t count for much if you can\u2019t back it up with justifiable results.    Cabinet office policy on open data was in the doldrums well before the referendum  Owen Boswarva - open data campaigner     \u201cThe Government has invested a lot of money in open data but then people were asking, \u2018what do you do with it?\u2019\u201d says Ian Hetherington, founder and CEO of 3D mapping software company eeGEO. \u201cWhat\u2019s the visualisation strategy? The data is useless unless you can visualise it.\u201d Now there are further concerns over the future of the UK\u2019s open data culture. \u201cCabinet office policy on open data was in the doldrums well before the referendum,\u201d says open data campaigner Owen Boswarva when asked whether he thought Brexit would give the UK\u2019s open data movement a kicking. \u201cOpen data is already under threat from austerity, deregulation and cuts to public services.\u201d Brexit, says Boswarva, could make it worse.   Related: Could social media be tearing us apart?    \u201cGovernment could use Brexit as an excuse to stop maintaining datasets that are produced to support EU programmes like Inspire and Eurostat, or to meet EU targets on air pollution and water quality. The UK would also no longer be bound by the PSI Directive, which underpins our regulatory framework for re-use of public sector information,\u201d adds Boswarva. Chi Onwurah MP, shadow minister for culture and the digital economy, is also concerned.  \u201cOpen data is very important to the current and future digital economy and the free flow of data drives innovation and improved services,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever that free flow of data requires recognised and agreed standards for privacy, security and data formats. Exiting the EU means we may not meet EU standards as a trusted party and there is likely to be less collaboration and research with EU partners. This is likely to stifle innovation unless the government takes action.\u201d     Citymapper is one of a growing number of apps tapping into public data Photograph: PR    This could have a huge impact as innovation has played a critical role in the unearthing of new open data initiatives, with a number of businesses having emerged over the past couple of years, such as transport app Citymapper, consultancy firm Geolytix, data analysts Spend Network and food marketplace Foodtrade, using public data as an essential base for their core proposition. More established companies such as engineering firm Arup and technical consultancy MIME Consulting use public data too to enhance their services and provide more accuracy to decision making. One start-up to have launched last year with an ambitious plan to \u201cmap the world in 3D\u201d was eeGEO. The Dundee-based company uses a number of public data sets with partners to create mapping solutions for governments and businesses but there are concerns, certainly around Brexit and what this may mean in terms of any potential cuts. Open data it seems could be an easy target; and businesses are worried that a more closed, inward looking UK may lose patience with the cost of publishing and maintaining open data sets, vital for their products. In Europe there is less concern. Marta Nagy-Rothengass, head of unit of the \u201cdata value chain\u201d in DG Connect at the European Commission says change is unlikely. The European Data Portal, launched last November shouldn\u2019t be affected, she says. It has over half a million datasets (including 37,000 from the data.gov.uk portal) and geographically is not limited to the EU member states. The UK also signed up to the G8 Open Data Charter in June 2013 committing to transparency and accountability. But while she talks about the benefits of open data outweighing any initial investment, she wouldn\u2019t be drawn on whether or not the UK would cut back on its open data commitments. So what is the UK mood? Theresa May has already hinted at her desire for more transparency, at least in business, something which Jeni Tennison, deputy CEO of the ODI, says is a sign that Brexit could in fact be good for open data. She talks about the growing importance of the digital economy to the UK and how, if we are to trade with Europe we will still have to adhere to the same rules and regulations in terms of open data and data protection. \u201cWe will need a strong data infrastructure to underpin our economy,\u201d says Tennison, adding that public and private data will be crucial in enabling digital services.    Related: Data trusts could allay our privacy fears    To a certain extent Boswarva agrees. Brexit, he says, \u201ccould be a wake-up call for the UK\u201d if government abandons austerity in favour of public investment. \u201cOpen data is one place to start,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is vital infrastructure for the digital economy. In the post-Brexit environment we will need to be more competitive. Some government departments, most recently Defra, are working hard to sustain that reputation. But many core reference datasets such as addresses and land ownership records remain under lock and key.\u201d Clearly Brexit will have an impact on open data projects and workers - especially as many are from EU states - but to what extent is still uncertain. However for some including Wendy Carrara, principal consultant at Capgemini Consulting, who was a key member of the European Data Portal project team last year, the idea of cuts is unfeasible.  \u201cWe have reached a point of no return,\u201d she says. \u201cDefining barriers or going back in terms of transparency would be very difficult.\u201d In short, it\u2019s just not worth the hassle, something some EU Remain campaigners said just a few long weeks ago.

Photograph: Courtesy of the victim    \u201cHe hit me nonstop,\u201d the victim told an officer, according to a report. \u201cHe was trying to kill me.\u201d  She had scratches on her neck and abrasions in numerous places, photos show. When she ran back inside Chiang\u2019s house hoping to get help from his roommate, the fiance \u201ccontinued to attack her further \u2026 by pulling and throwing her\u201d, she told police, the report says. After talking to witnesses and reviewing the woman\u2019s injuries, officers arrested Chiang for domestic violence, and prosecutors charged him with a felony of assaulting a \u201cspouse\u201d and inflicting injuries \u201cresulting in a traumatic condition\u201d. If convicted, he could have faced four years in prison.  The woman later told police that the October attack was not the first time Chiang had assaulted her. During an earlier altercation, he had allegedly told her \u201csomething to the effect of \u2018Don\u2019t think I won\u2019t kill you,\u2019\u201d a second police report says. In an interview in Palo Alto after one of Chiang\u2019s recent court appearances, Jane Doe said she hadn\u2019t reported her fiance\u2019s abuse because she thought he might stop. But when police showed up after the October incident, she hoped Chiang would face consequences. However, when she sought support from a local church her fiance attended, leaders tried to persuade her to forgive Chiang, she said. The woman \u2013 who emigrated from Taiwan to the US by herself as a young teenager \u2013 said she felt she would have a strong case in a trial. \u201cI have evidence. I have witnesses. I have police reports. I have photos,\u201d she said, adding that once the court saw the images of her bloodied face and bruises, she expected Chiang would be given a serious punishment. \u201cIf he had used more force, maybe I\u2019d be dead or my brain would be dead.\u201d But when Jane Doe\u2019s case landed in Department 89 \u2013 Judge Persky\u2019s courtroom \u2013 the proceedings did not go as she had hoped.  \u2018Just like the Stanford case\u2019 Persky faced international scrutiny and a high-profile recall campaign after he sentenced Turner, the former Stanford swimmer, to six months in county jail. The punishment was significantly lighter than the minimum of two years in state prison prescribed by law for Turner\u2019s offenses \u2013 assault with intent to rape an intoxicated woman and sexually penetrating an intoxicated and unconscious person with a foreign object. On 18 January 2015, two bystanders caught Turner \u201cthrusting\u201d on top of a motionless woman outside a fraternity house by a dumpster. Turner has refused to admit that he assaulted the woman.  The case sparked widespread outrage largely due to the 23-year-old victim\u2019s powerful and articulate statement about the devastating impacts of rape culture and sexual violence. Jane Doe, who was on the court docket just before the infamous Turner hearing on 2 June, said she watched news of the Stanford sentencing spread on Facebook and immediately recognized the parallels to her own court battle.     Further injuries documented by Jane Doe. Photograph: Courtesy of the victim    \u201cIt\u2019s just like the Stanford case,\u201d she said, noting that Chiang \u2013 a well-paid and highly educated engineer \u2013 was also a privileged defendant who could afford a private lawyer. In the final deal Persky approved, Chiang pleaded no contest to a battery offense lesser than the more serious charge he initially faced. The lesser offense was still a serious domestic violence felony that could have landed him in state prison for four years, according to the formal plea deal. But instead, Chiang avoided prison altogether. The agreement called for 72 days in county jail, and Persky allowed the defendant to complete the sentence on weekends. Ultimately, he will only have to serve half of that time, said Kalila Spain, a local prosecutor who represented the victim. A spokesman for the court declined to comment on the case, but noted in an email that sentences in plea deals are \u201cindependently agreed to by the District Attorney and defense counsel\u201d. Earl Jiang, Chiang\u2019s lawyer, said he denies allegations of previous incidents of domestic violence. Jiang also downplayed the seriousness of the assault, saying: \u201cThey had a conflict, and my client from the very beginning acknowledged that he could\u2019ve handled the situation better than he did. He let his emotions control him.\u201d  Chiang did not respond to a request for comment through his lawyer. In her moving speech in court, Jane Doe said she has struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder and that it seemed unfair that a defendant\u2019s lawyer could negotiate with the court to get such a favorable sentence for such a violent crime.    On multiple occasions, Judge Persky asked her to speed up and finish her remarks    \u201cAs the victim, when I get beaten, can I ask for a better offer? Can I ask for a \u2018discount\u2019 beating?\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no opportunity for me to negotiate.\u201d When she read her lengthy statement in court, the woman struggled at times, since English is not her first language. On multiple occasions, Persky asked her to speed up and finish her remarks. After she concluded, Persky said little about her speech. Instead, the judge and Chiang\u2019s lawyer discussed the timing of jail in what appeared to be an effort to ensure that the defendant would be released each weekend in time for work on Monday. Speaking up for immigrant victims Since the Stanford sentencing, opponents and others have closely analyzed Persky\u2019s previous actions to see if the Turner decision reflected a broader trend. The judge\u2019s allies \u2013 who include former judges, public defenders and criminal justice reform advocates \u2013 argue that Persky has been consistent in sentencing and that judicial discretion is critical to ensure that defendants receive fair treatment. Harsher sentencing practices can unfairly punish low-income defendants, particularly people of color who are disproportionately caught up in the criminal justice system, according to Persky\u2019s supporters.  They also contend that judges have passive roles in plea deals and should not be held accountable for approving decisions that prosecutors and defense attorneys determine. \u201cThis case was a deal that was negotiated with the district attorney\u2019s office,\u201d said Jiang.  But Michele Landis Dauber, a Stanford law school professor leading the recall campaign against Persky, said the Chiang case was further evidence that the judge was unfit for his position.  \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a pattern of failing to take violence against women seriously,\u201d said Dauber, who is a family friend of the Stanford victim. Dauber sat in court when Chiang\u2019s victim read her statement. \u201c[Persky] seemed way more concerned about whether Mr Chiang would get to work on time than he did about how this victim is doing and how she was managing the trauma he had inflicted on her,\u201d Dauber said. \u201cIn addition to the fact that he treated her insensitively, the sentence itself is manifestly insensitive to the brutality of the beating,\u201d she said. The Stanford victim has also told Dauber she was shocked and upset by how the other victim in the courtroom was treated that day. The woman in the Chiang case said she wanted to share her story in hopes that it would help other victims come forward, especially minority women and immigrants who often fail to get the support they need when they are abused. \u201cMinority people don\u2019t get sufficient resources \u2026 Today, only I\u2019m suffering. But how about tomorrow? How about the next girl?\u201d she said. \u201cWhere can we search for help?\u201d Although she felt the Stanford decision was unfair, \u201cat least people noticed,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least people paid attention.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/08/pokemon-go-players-fined-driving-taiwan", "publicationDate": "2016-08-08T08:44:37Z", "tags": ["Pok\u00e9mon Go", "Technology", "Pok\u00e9mon", "Games"], "sentences": ["Pok\u00e9mon Go was only released in Taiwan on Saturday \u2013 but hundreds of eager players have already been fined for playing the game on their phones while driving.", "Taiwan\u2019s premier, Lin Chuan, issued a warning via his cabinet\u2019s Facebook page, saying: \u201cCatch the rare creatures, but don\u2019t let accidents catch up with you!\u201d  The game has already been banned in some areas.", "Taipei\u2019s National Palace Museum forbids visitors from playing Pok\u00e9mon Go in its exhibition halls, while the Taiwan Railways Administration has a list of places the game can\u2019t be played, including its stations, trains and along its railway tracks."], "title": "Hundreds of Pok\u00e9mon Go players fined for playing while driving in Taiwan", "article": "Pok\u00e9mon Go was only released in Taiwan on Saturday \u2013 but hundreds of eager players have already been fined for playing the game on their phones while driving.

Diplomats and military officers told Reuters Hanoi had shipped the launchers from the Vietnamese mainland into positions on five bases in the Spratly islands in recent months. They said the launchers could be made operational, if needed, with rocket artillery rounds within two or three days. The Guardian was unable to verify the report, which cited unnamed western officials, and Vietnam\u2019s foreign ministry said the information was inaccurate. Yet the report entrenches fears of militarisation and potential conflicts in the South China Sea, the most contentious issue in east Asia. Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan and Japan have overlapping claims with China to islands in the South China Sea and East China Sea. The region is thought to have significant oil and gas reserves and is a route for roughly \u00a33.17tn in trade. The launchers are believed to be part of Vietnam\u2019s \u201cExtra\u201d rocket artillery system recently acquired from Israel. They have a range of 150km (93 miles) and carry 150kg warheads that can attack multiple targets at once. Last month, Beijing reacted angrily to an international legal case that it lost to the Philippines over contested reefs and atolls, increasing global diplomatic pressure on China to scale back military expansion in the area. But Beijing instead appears to have continued building bases on islands it has reclaimed, and satellite images released on Wednesday show China has placed reinforced aircraft hangars on islands it controls. The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) published recent satellite photographs showing the construction of the hangars on three reclaimed islands where Beijing has built military bases. China landed a military transport plane in the South China Sea last month but the runways it completed this year have not yet been used to land military jets. CSIS said the new buildings on each of the islets, Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs, \u201cwill soon have hangar space for 24 fighter-jets plus three to four larger planes\u201d and \u201ccan easily accommodate any fighter-jet in [China\u2019s] People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force\u201d. That includes fighters such as the J-11 and Su-30 as well as larger bombers such as the H-6. The biggest hangars can accommodate the 46.6-metre-long KJ-2000 surveillance aircraft. China\u2019s president, Xi Jingping, said last year that he did not intend to militarise the South China Sea but the images suggest otherwise, with CSIS saying the hangars are reinforced to withstand military strikes. In February, China deployed surface-to-air missile launchers on Woody Island, dramatically upping the stakes in the South China Sea. Tensions have also deepened this month over South Korea\u2019s decision to host an advanced US-made anti-missile defence unit, a move that angered China. South Korea and the U have said the radar system, called a terminal high altitude area defence (Thaad) unit, would only be used in defence against North Korean ballistic missiles. But the placement of the Thaad, made by Lockheed Martin, is seen by China as move to monitor its missile deployment in the region. The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, said the Thaad plan was an \u201cout-and-out strategic\u201d move. Carl Thayer, an analyst on the South China Sea at the Australian Defence Force Academy, told the Guardian the Thaad deployment, China\u2019s construction of military hangars and Vietnamese rocket launcher deployments had created emerging crisis spots in east Asia. \u201cEach of these hot spots represents an action-reaction cycle that has the potential to escalate,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cAt a time of increasing tensions, accidents and miscalculations that likely hold of a clash between military ships and planes increases.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/11/rescuing-trafficked-fishermen-cape-town-south-africa-slave-like-conditions", "publicationDate": "2016-08-11T08:00:32Z", "tags": ["Global development", "South Africa", "Africa", "World news", "Fishing"], "sentences": ["Benjamin*, 24, a farmer back in the Philippines, says he\u2019s owed months of wages for his time on a Taiwanese-flagged vessel, aboard which he and his crewmates endured beatings for not working hard enough.", "\u201cIt\u2019s common to get complaints on Chinese and Taiwanese vessels,\u201d says Muhammad Sadri, at the Indonesian consulate.", "\u201cMany of the fishermen ask to go home because of the conditions on board, but the contracts put them in a weak position, because they must fulfil their obligations for 24 months, and for the first six or eight months almost all of their salary will be deducted.\u201d Cases uncovered by the ITF in Cape Town echo the findings of a recent Greenpeace report on Taiwan\u2019s overseas fishing industry, which, it says, appears \u201cbeset by issues of human trafficking\u201d.", "The report is based on interviews with more than 100 fishers in Taiwan and abroad, and the authors report non-payment or under-payment of wages, physical abuse and a lack of food and drink.", "Related: Revealed: how the Thai fishing industry trafficks, imprisons and enslaves    The year-long investigation describes a system in which Taiwanese fishing companies, desperate for cheap labour, hire foreign fishers from neighbouring countries and subject them to slave-like conditions.", "\u201cWe get a lot of reports of these abuses \u2013 trafficking, inhumane conditions [on Chinese and Taiwanese ships], where people don\u2019t eat properly; there\u2019s no proper health or medicine.\u201d A spokesman for South Africa\u2019s Department of Home Affairs would not respond to repeated requests for information, saying only that it inspects \u201cevery single ship that comes to port\u201d \u2013 an account disputed by maritime attorney Alan Goldberg."], "title": "Bid for freedom: rescuing trafficked fishermen as they dock in Cape Town", "article": "Less than a mile from Cape Town\u2019s picturesque waterfront shops and cafes, dozens of fishermen work on docked vessels on the other side of the port, unseen by tourists strolling down the boardwalk. This is one of Africa\u2019s largest ports, on a major sea route between east and west. Here, many boats come and go \u2013 to pick up crew members, call in for repairs or fuel up. Many of the fishermen on these boats, who are mainly from south-east Asia, are victims of abuse and forced labour. They are desperate to escape the cycle of exploitation before they\u2019re taken back out to the high seas.

The 32-year-old Filipino and his colleagues are rolling up fishing line on deck, when a man approaches their vessel. Dane Duplessis shouts to them as he climbs up the ladder to board. Duplessis, a young chaplain with the charity Biblia, a South African Christian NGO, is inspecting boats in an effort to find victims of slave labour. After some coaxing, the half-dozen Filipino fishermen manage through broken English to convey that they haven\u2019t been paid in months.  \u201cWe hear that a lot,\u201d says Duplessis, who discovers cases of unpaid work and forced labour every month. \u201cOnce you go on to one of these vessels, it\u2019s like stepping into a squatter camp. I can tell you this vessel was made in the 80s \u2013 it\u2019s rusted, and it smells bad. That\u2019s why I took a concern in these guys and in their lives.\u201d Alex and his crewmates\u2019 passports are locked up with the captain, so the fishermen can\u2019t go far. \u201cThey haven\u2019t seen their contracts,\u201d says Duplessis, adding that it sounds like a case of trafficking. Benjamin*, 24, a farmer back in the Philippines, says he\u2019s owed months of wages for his time on a Taiwanese-flagged vessel, aboard which he and his crewmates endured beatings for not working hard enough. \u201cOur captain is no good, sir,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery day he\u2019s punching and kicking one of us.\u201d The vessel fished mainly for tuna and squid in the Pacific Ocean before sailing to Cape Town in January, and docking after more than five months at sea.  Several crew members had heard about the Mission to Seafarers in Cape Town, where seamen can buy food and phone credit, and unwind \u2013 and went there to seek help. Duplessis works at the Mission alongside Cassiem Augustus, an inspector with the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation (ITF). Together, Duplessis and Augustus planned the escape of more than 25 crew. The men returned to get their belongings, and Duplessis picked them up in a large van. Over the angry objections of senior officers, he brought them to a safe house. Augustus negotiated with the shipowner\u2019s agency and arranged for the men to be flown home at the company\u2019s expense.   Related: Cameroon fishing industry and tourism battered by extreme weather    Now Benjamin is back home in the Philippines with his family, but he doesn\u2019t expect to ever get the money he\u2019s owed. Duplessis and Augustus have managed to resolve hundreds of cases over the years, freeing victims of forced labour or obtaining unpaid wages. But while they can put pressure on companies with offices in South Africa, they have little influence over the recruitment agencies in charge of paying fishermen in their home countries. For many fishermen in south-east Asia, the promises of big wages hide an ugly reality: months at sea with little food and drinking water, working 16- to 24-hour days, for salaries that are frequently unpaid. Benjamin says the Filipino consulate has done little to help. Few are as active as the Indonesian consulate general in Cape Town, which has sounded the alarm, informing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that it continues to receive reports of human rights complaints by Indonesian fishermen every month. \u201cIt\u2019s common to get complaints on Chinese and Taiwanese vessels,\u201d says Muhammad Sadri, at the Indonesian consulate.  \u201cMany of the fishermen ask to go home because of the conditions on board, but the contracts put them in a weak position, because they must fulfil their obligations for 24 months, and for the first six or eight months almost all of their salary will be deducted.\u201d Cases uncovered by the ITF in Cape Town echo the findings of a recent Greenpeace report on Taiwan\u2019s overseas fishing industry, which, it says, appears \u201cbeset by issues of human trafficking\u201d. The report is based on interviews with more than 100 fishers in Taiwan and abroad, and the authors report non-payment or under-payment of wages, physical abuse and a lack of food and drink.    Related: Revealed: how the Thai fishing industry trafficks, imprisons and enslaves    The year-long investigation describes a system in which Taiwanese fishing companies, desperate for cheap labour, hire foreign fishers from neighbouring countries and subject them to slave-like conditions.

In late 2013, more than 70 Indonesian fishermen were living in squalid conditions on several vessels at the port, relying on food provided by local people. They were picked up by officials and detained for more than two months before being sent back to Indonesia \u2013 a case cited by the US State Department\u2019s Trafficking in Persons report.

He received a PhD in nuclear engineering from the University of Illinois in 1980, and became a naturalised US citizen three years later. .

Ho has worked as a consultant for China General Nuclear Power, which has a 33% stake in the UK\u2019s \u00a318bn Hinkley Point C project. Prosecutors allege that he enticed US nuclear experts at the federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority energy corporation to pass sensitive information to Beijing by paying them bribes. They also allege that he failed to register with the Department of Justice as an agent of a foreign state and that he is paid by the Chinese government. Ho is charged with helping a foreign power produce nuclear material, a term that refers to enriched uranium and plutonium for nuclear reactor fuel.

According to the US Department of Justice, the FBI has discovered evidence that China General Nuclear Power (CGN) has been engaged in a conspiracy to steal US nuclear secrets stretching back almost two decades. Both CGN and one of the corporation\u2019s senior advisers, Szuhsiung Ho, have been charged with conspiring to help the Chinese government develop nuclear material in a manner that is in clear breach of US law.   Related: May urged to pull plug immediately on Hinkley C over spying allegations    Ho, who is alleged to have boasted that \u201cbudget is no issue\u201d while developing his network of co-conspirators, has also been charged with acting unlawfully as a foreign agent. His legal team argues that there is far less to this affair than meets the eye. It says he is an innocent, 66-year-old Chinese American known to most of his friends and neighbours as Allen Ho, who has been openly engaged in commercial activity involving non-classified information. Now, it says, overzealous prosecutors are turning his life upside down. The lawyers also say that Ho could not possibly have known about the clauses in the US Atomic Energy Act that he is alleged to have breached, because no one has previously been charged under them in the 60-odd years they have been on the statute. His lawyer, Peter Zeidenberg, says it is unclear to him whether any crime has actually been committed. Ho\u2019s legal team, however, has a number of hurdles to overcome. The first is that one of his alleged agents, Ching Ning Guey, a senior manager with the Tennessee Valley Authority\u2019s nuclear programme, has already pleaded guilty to unlawfully developing special nuclear material outside the US without government authority.   Related: Who is the US engineer accused of nuclear espionage?    The guilty plea was sealed for more than a year, until Ho was arrested in Atlanta earlier this year, and both he and CGN were charged. Another is that among the many emails the FBI has gathered and used to build a case against Ho is one in which he allegedly describes a $15,555 (\u00a312,000) payment made to Guey as coming from \u201chis company\u2019s slush fund\u201d. CGN, Ho, and a company he owns called Energy Technology International, all face a charge that they \u201cdid conspire with each other and with others known and unknown to wilfully and knowingly engage and participate \u2026 in the development and production of special nuclear material outside of the United States, namely, in the People\u2019s Republic of China\u201d. According to sections 2077(b) and 2272(a) of the Atomic Energy Act, this can be done only with the permission of the US energy secretary. Ho faces a possible life sentence if convicted. The offence is also punishable by a $250,000 fine. There has been no immediate comment from CGN. According to the indictment, Ho\u2019s efforts began in 1997 and only came to an end with his arrest in April. He is alleged to have been attempting to provide technical assistance for CGN\u2019s small modular reactor programme, advanced fuel assembly programme, in-core detector systems and various nuclear-related computer codes. Operating from a large colonial-style mansion in the suburbs of Wilmington, Delaware, where he lives with his wife, Anne, Ho is alleged to have recruited Guey and five other nuclear specialists. Identified in the indictment as \u201cUS Persons 2 to 6\u201d, they are all nuclear engineers or mechanical engineers working in the nuclear industry, and living in Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Colorado.

Some of them were also paid for answering a series of questions submitted by CGN employees, and Guey and \u201cPersons 5 and 6\u201d are alleged to have travelled to China to give presentations. Guey is said to have received his $15,555 payment in a cheque sent to an address in Chattanooga, and \u201cPerson 6\u201d is said to have received $22,698 for consulting services and travel expenses. Ho was born in Taiwan and graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1971. Two years later he travelled to the US to take a master\u2019s degree at the University of California, and married Anne the following year. He completed a PhD in nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois in 1980. The couple are naturalised US citizens. When Ho appeared in court in Knoxville, Tennessee, in April, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that prosecutors alleged he had channelled about $3m from a Chinese bank to various banks in the US. They also said that when arrested he was in possession of an encrypted Chinese bank card. Ho is also said to have a second wife and a nine-year-old son in China. The assistant US attorney Charles Atchley Jr was quoted as saying: \u201cThis man is not living in the US. He may be a US citizen, but he lives in China.

In November, in an article in the Washington Post, Zeidenberg wrote that he believed innocent Chinese Americans were being victimised by prosecutors swept up by an atmosphere of paranoia about the dangers of cyber-attacks and industrial espionage directed by Beijing.  Two of his clients had been charged with illicitly handing over technical secrets, only for the charges to be dropped or dismissed, but by then their private and professional lives had been severely damaged. \u201cWhile the danger posed by Chinese agents may indeed be real, so is the danger of overreacting to it,\u201d he wrote."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/sarcasm-trump-obama-isis-cnn", "publicationDate": "2016-08-12T12:40:55Z", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "US elections 2016", "US politics", "US news"], "sentences": ["But little is known about the 66-year-old American citizen who was born in Taiwan, educated in the US and lives in Wilmington, Delaware."], "title": "Don't take me so seriously, says 'sarcastic' Trump | The daily briefing", "article": "Trump retracts Isis accusation, mocks Clinton Donald Trump has tweeted a retraction of comments he has made repeatedly this week claiming Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were the co-founders of Isis. \u201cRatings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) \u2018the founder\u2019 of ISIS, &amp; MVP,\u201d he tweeted at 3.26am on Friday. \u201cTHEY DON\u2019T GET SARCASM?\u201d In Florida on Thursday night, the Republican candidate implied Clinton lacks mental stamina, and twice got the day wrong. \u201cLook, what happens, she gives a short speech then she goes home, goes to sleep, she shows up two days later.

A metallurgist, he worked in munitions in Oxford during the second world war and later ran a hotel in Knaresborough, North Yorkshire. Pat joined the British Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) in the early 1940s and served in Cairo, where she met Glasgow-born Lieutenant Hugh McCubbin.

He didn\u2019t expect to one day be risking his life opening stores in some of the most dangerous and corrupt regions in the world.  The Yorkshireman cut his consultancy teeth with Asda, transforming it from a discount store in the north of England into a major supermarket chain. After working with a client in Asia to open more than 200 small supermarkets across Hong Kong, China and Taiwan, he saw an opportunity to sell the UK model of consumer-focused retail to developing countries.  \u201cBritish retailing is the best in the world because it has within it all its processes, systems and organisation that focus on the customer and delivers to the customer what they require,\u201d says Ibbotson. Ibbotson launched management consultancy Retail Vision 18 years ago to meet the growing demand for brand Britain abroad, employing a team of associates who have all held senior positions in UK retail.  While they have undertaken projects in Canada and Barbados, they have also taken on clients in countries scarred by conflict or political upheaval, such as Palestine and Iran. Doing business in these often unstable environments comes with huge risks \u2013 both personal and professional.  Working with one client in Ukraine to develop its nationwide chain of 150 mobile phone stores, they were forced to sell dozens of outlets in Crimea when it was annexed by Russia in 2014. And a rocket landed at the entrance of one of their shops in war-torn Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, where all seven of their stores closed as a result of the ongoing conflict. During work on a separate project in the troubled eastern European country, Ibbotson recalls being forced to make a hasty escape out the back door of the store he was working in after armed police raided the building. The claim was that the company had fallen behind on their \u201ctaxes\u201d, according to Ibbotson.  \u201cWe were working for one of Ukraine\u2019s biggest consumer electrical retailers and had just opened a new store for them,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe oligarch who owned the business had, for some reason, fallen out with someone in the government, so the police rolled up in two 10 tonne trucks with kalashnikovs and big boots on, stormed into the building, took all the company servers away, and then drove off.  \u201cAll the employees had the virtually impossible task of working for 10 days without computers until the right people were paid off and the business was allowed to continue. It was scary for me and everybody.\u201d Corruption and bribery is endemic in many of the countries which Retail Vision does business in, so Ibbotson has had to take steps to protect his interests. Firstly, building a good relationship with a client is essential to the success of a project. He claims that in many cases the person in charge of the business is only there because of family or political connections and has little retail experience. It is therefore necessary to educate them about why changes are being made and hold their hand throughout the process. Trust with the client is achieved when results are delivered.      John Ibbotson. Photograph: Pr    In some cases, however, trust is unlikely to ever be at a comfortable level for Ibbotson and the biggest risk in those situations is not getting paid. He asks for 50% up front from the client before agreeing to travel to the country and start consultancy work. Once he arrives there he insists the other half is transferred directly into his business account.  It\u2019s a lesson he learned the hard way while working with a client in Nigeria who owned a chain of convenience stores. After being paid 50% up front, he flew to the capital Lagos where he was given no choice but to accept the rest of the fee in hard cash. He says: \u201cAt the end of my visit I went to the airport to catch my flight home and this guy rolls up with an envelope. I opened it up and it was \u00a310,000 in dirty \u00a350 notes. I went through customs, they pulled out the envelope, looked at it and put it back and said I was OK.  \u201cThe biggest problem was paying it into Barclays in Huddersfield. I thought they were bound to be fakes. The bank had to count it and report it for possible money laundering. Fortunately you were allowed to put in \u00a310,000 and under and they weren\u2019t fakes, so it went through.\u201d It is important to be patient throughout the process and to persevere despite constant setbacks. Ibbotson says it is common for major projects to fall through and for months of hard work to come to nothing. For example, the company was recently hired to make seven existing stores in Palestine profitable. After they achieved that aim, Retail Vision gave them a new format for supermarkets, similar to a Tesco store of 20,000 square feet. They branded the pilot store in Nablus, which was a success, and the plan was to open a further nine supermarkets. However, the holding company got cold feet at the last minute blaming the deteriorating political climate in the country and a lack of finance. You have to have enough irons in the fire so when a project does collapse, the business can continue to run successfully. \u201cThe company will go through peaks and troughs but you have to just put up with that. You have just got to ride with it and make sure you have other projects in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. In September, Retail Vision, which now has a team of 12 consultants, will return to Ukraine to continue planning, developing and redesigning 40 flagship stores for one of the country\u2019s leading mobile phone retailers. Ibbotson will also travel to Iran to run a feasibility study for a chain of consumer electrical and mobile phone stores similar to Dixons Carphone in the UK for a huge holding company there. He claims that with the lifting of sanctions, Iran is the new frontier for organised retail.

These fairly shy forest birds lack the ability for long-distance flying and are not migratory. As such, their spread around the world is not just a tale of domestication, but one that is intimately linked to the movements of people around the world. Darwin was the first to suggest that all domestic chickens descended from the red junglefowl Gallus gallus. The earliest archaeological evidence for domesticated chickens has been reported from sites in China, where chicken bones had been found dating back to 10,000-8000 years ago (West and Zhou, 1988; Xiang et al., 2014). However, close examination of the reported chicken remains found that most, if not all, bones identified as chicken are ring-necked pheasants, a species common in China, instead (Peters et al., 2016; Eda et al., 2015). Evidence from China regarding the early domestication of chickens remains controversial, but chicken remains from the Indus Valley in northern India suggests that domesticated chickens were present in southern Asia 4,000 years ago.  The rise of new molecular techniques, such as DNA analysis, allowed scientists to look at the domestication of chickens at a whole new level. An early study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) showed that domestic chickens indeed descended from the red junglefowl, and indicated that a single domestication event had taken place in Thailand (Fumihito et al., 1996). More recent studies showed that the domestication of chickens occurred in at least three separate regions in Asia (Liu et al., 2006). Moreover, domesticated chickens interbred with local populations of different wild jungle fowl species; the gene for yellow legs, an ubiquitous characteristic of domesticated chickens, can be traced back to the closely related grey junglefowl (Gallus sonneratii) (Eriksson et al., 2008) rather than the red junglefowl. From southern Asia, the chicken left its natural range behind and embarked on its Grand Tour. Domestic chickens reached West Asia and the Near East during the third and second millennium BC, and were introduced to Europe by the Phoenicians during the 8th century BC (Perry-Gal et al., 2015). Up till then, chickens had had a mostly ceremonial or symbolic role, as evidenced by the inclusion of chickens in burials, clay figurines in early Chinese cultures and mentions of chickens in early texts. As chickens spread through Europe, chicken remains in archaeological assemblages became more abundant. This indicates that chickens had started to form an established part of European livestock, and the sagas have it that when the Vikings colonised Iceland in the 10th century, they took along their chickens.

From left to right: Blue Cochin, Silkie, and Malay. Composite: Oli Scarff/Getty Images    Today\u2019s chickens represent a range of different sizes, body proportions, plumage colours, behaviour, and physiological traits related to meat and egg production. Although it is thought that many modern breeds originated relatively recently (in the 18th-19th century), evidence from historical sources suggests that selective breeding was already practiced during Roman times and that several regions had their own domestic chickens with particular characteristics (de Cupere et al., 2005). The spread of chickens from Asia south- and eastwards is thought to have been initiated by the first farmers, or Austronesians, who spread from mainland China into Island South East Asia around 5000 years ago. With them, they took pottery and agriculture including domestic animals such as pigs and dogs (Bellwood and Dizon, 2006). Although archaeological chicken remains from this region are very scarce, it is assumed that chickens formed part of this agricultural package as well. When the Polynesians subsequently colonized the Pacific island archipelagos, chickens were taken with them. Remains of chickens have been found in archaeological assemblages all over the Pacific region, and on the Hawaiian island Kauai, chickens introduced by the Polynesians some 800 years ago now run wild. Controversial evidence even suggests that the Polynesians brought chickens to South America (Storey et al., 2007) long before Columbus set foot on the continent.  Given the widespread introductions of chickens (and other commensals such as the Pacific rat Rattus exulans) by the Polynesians, it was generally assumed that the same had happened when the Polynesians colonized New Zealand in the thirteenth century. But chickens were conspicuously absent from the earliest Polynesian archaeological assemblages. Had they been overlooked? Lost to disease or predation after their arrival? Was the abundance of large flightless birds that required little effort to capture reason to abandon the keeping of chickens? Or, were they never there in the first place? To settle the question of when chickens arrived in New Zealand, researchers used radiocarbon dating to assess the age of three archaeological chicken bones that could potentially date to the period of Polynesian colonisation.      A chicken leg bone from New Zealand\u2019s South Island, which radiocarbon dating has revealed dates to around the time of Captain Cook\u2019s second voyage. Photograph: Paul Scofield, Canterbury Museum.    Surprisingly, the bones turned out to be quite young, with median ages of 1756, 1757 and 1840 - although note that the radiocarbon method yields age probability distributions rather than a single age, (Wood et al., 2016). These ages postdate the arrival of Polynesians by far, and pre-date permanent European settlement, but their age distributions overlap with the arrival of Captain James Cook\u2019s second voyage in 1773. Moreover, Cook recorded gifting several chickens, both hens and cocks, to local M\u0101ori on several occasions. Little is known regarding the fate of these chickens, and it is unclear if the bones sampled in this study represent the chickens that were gifted by Captain Cook, or their descendants. The trading by M\u0101ori of other European items between settlements along the coast suggests that M\u0101ori were quick to incorporate chickens into their diet.  This may not just have been a matter of taste. Before the arrival of humans, New Zealand was home to a unique terrestrial fauna that included large flightless birds such as the moa, and large numbers of sea birds that bred in colonies on land. Much of the native fauna had gone extinct in less than two centuries after the Polynesians arrived. Moreover, evidence from East Polynesia suggests that long-distance trading had almost ceased around that time, and that the ability to make long voyages may have been lost among M\u0101ori. With protein sources dwindling rapidly, and without the possibility to resupply by long-distance trading, M\u0101ori were facing limited food resources. The arrival of chickens may have been met with relief.      Portrait of James Cook, He Who Brought The Chicken. Oil painting by Nathaniel Dance, 1775-76. Photograph: Dea Picture Library/De Agostini/Getty Images    Despite their title of the oldest chicken bones from New Zealand, the bones do not answer the question of whether or not chickens were introduced to New Zealand by the first Polynesians. However, the authors argue, had chickens been on board of the first Polynesian canoes and formed an established part of the settlers\u2019 diet, their bones would have been more abundant in the earliest Polynesian assemblages, as is the case on other Polynesian islands. The fact that New Zealand was teeming with a diverse terrestrial fauna that was easy prey may have been enough incentive to leave the chicken be.  References Bellwood and Dizon, 2005.

Blushed (at the Counting House) is a two-hander by Hannah Ballard and Lexi Bradburn, who formed Sole Rebel Tap in 2010. The piece is a freewheeling examination of the sexual symbolism of shoes in fairytales, accompanied by tap dancing. Ballard and Blackburn devise amusing alternative narratives \u2013 Cinderella\u2019s \u201cwalk of shame\u201d after the ball, and a prince who is left holding \u201ca shoe full of blood\u201d \u2013 and they deliver their tap sequences with cheery competence.

It\u2019s not subtle, but it sends you on your way with a smile. Temper Theatre\u2019s Terra Incognita (Zoo Southside), directed by Finn Morrell, depicts the end of the world. A male figure in a business suit (performers are uncredited) is granted visions of an apocalyptic future. His guide is a female figure representing Nature, who is betrayed by corporate greed and hard-hatted despoilers. Blind to the consequences, hollow-eyed revellers carouse to a soundtrack of Pink Floyd\u2019s Money and David Bowie\u2019s Fame. With ingenuity and the minimum of resources, the production conjures a place of darkness and howling winds, and by the end, Nature lies broken and dead. The piece is blazingly sincere, but its one-note character and an absence of fine shading detract considerably from its theatricality.     Temper Theatre\u2019s Terra Incognita: \u2018ingenuity and minimum resources\u2019.    Janis Claxton\u2019s Pop-Up Duets (fragments of love) is all nuance and subtle interplay. Sited in the public spaces of the National Museum of Scotland, the work comprises nine danced encounters, performed in varying pairings by Christina Liddell, Carlos J Martinez, Adrienne O\u2019Leary and James Southward, all excellent. The duets have an organic feel, with the dancers materialising from the audience and melting back into it. The theme is love, and Claxton gives us delicate moments of pursuit, of advance and retreat, glance and touch, circling and circumspection. The movement is seamless: flickering kinetics, spiralling exchanges, bold and sudden lifts.     \u2018Delicate moments of pursuit\u2019: Janis Claxton\u2019s Pop-Up Duets at the National Museum of Scotland. Photograph: Roy Campbell-Moore      Janis Claxton is a dance-maker at the top of her technical game, with a rare emotional intelligence    Pop-Up Duets is satisfying in a purely abstract sense; Claxton\u2019s choreography deploys bodyweight with a sculptor\u2019s precision, making absolute sense of the gallery venue. But this is also, in its free-form way, a narrative piece, and Claxton folds in much wit and tenderness. There\u2019s a finely poised composition for the two women, all loaded pauses and sensuously supported back bends, but the final duet for the two men \u2013 wheeling, challenging, cleaving \u2013 is perhaps the most fully realised of the nine. Claxton\u2019s is an underrated talent. Aged 51, she is a dance-maker at the top of her technical game, with a rare emotional intelligence. I\u2019ve been watching her work for more than 15 years, and I\u2019m not the only dance writer to deplore the way that she has consistently been passed over in favour of younger, less experienced men. This is a story with which female choreographers are wearily familiar. The issue of equal access to creative power roles in dance has long been fudged or ignored, and all too often remains unaddressed. Nothing prepared me for the tiny wonder that is Trinity (Theatre Arts Exchange). Brave New Worlds is a performance company founded in 2014 by Valentina Ceschi, Kate Lane and Guoda Jaruseviciute, and based in London and Vilnius, Lithuania. The piece examines the way that women\u2019s bodies and biology have been obscured, occluded and fetishised over the ages. To an ominous neo-gothic soundtrack by Demetrio Castellucci, we see a parade of startling and evolving images referencing, among other sources, high fashion and medieval painting.     Trinity: a startling take on the depiction of women\u2019s bodies through the centuries    The stage is policed by Ceschi and Jaruseviciute, dressed like Victorian prison warders. Lane enters in a cream Fortuny dress, her head wrapped in white tulle. She shudders, twitches, keens an inaudible song. Ceschi and Jaruseviciute reappear in costumes vaguely reminiscent of the paintings of Max Ernst, one crowned with spikes. The parade becomes increasingly dreamlike. A faceless figure in blue, its belly vastly distended in a grotesque simulacrum of pregnancy, floats across the stage. A nun struggles to breathe behind a bag-like mask. There are glimpsed references to the smeared horrors of Francis Bacon\u2019s paintings, and to the iconography of Catholic martyrdom. The final and most bizarre image is of a woman completely costumed in charcoal. Has she been burnt at the stake? Is she a saint? A witch? The enigma, and the not-quite-knowing, are all.     \u2018Mordant beauty\u2019: The Sacrifice of Roaring by Hsu Chen Wei.    The Sacrifice of Roaring (at Zoo) was created by the Taiwanese choreographer Hsu Chen Wei as a meditation on the ritualistic aspects of death. As a red light swings in the darkness, we hear plinking batsqueaks of sound, and a male monologue, spoken in despairing tones. Two women (Lin Yi-Chi and Chan Chi-Cheng) sway rhythmically, and fold into slow collapses. They look fearful and vulnerable, and at several points draw up their shifts to reveal girlish red knickers. A third woman (Chen Yeh-Ying) materialises. She is a mystical, implacable figure who animates the other two. As they twitch and writhe, buffeted by invisible forces, she sways like a triumphant cobra. Meanwhile, electric guitarist Wu Hsin-Tse delivers plaintive riffs and dark swirls of feedback. The atmosphere of dread, and the sense of the ineluctable approach of oblivion, invite comparisons with Nijinsky\u2019s The Rite of Spring, but Hsu\u2019s choreography is exquisitely pared back; there\u2019s not a single excess movement. You leave the performance space charged by the work\u2019s mordant beauty.

Today, despite working out of modest premises with just two tiny pot stills in the hills of Chichibu, a town 100 km northwest of Tokyo, Akuto\u2019s single malts are winning rave reviews from the global whisky cognoscenti. Many are willing to pay hundreds of dollars - and in a few cases much more - for a bottle of single malt from what is Japan\u2019s smallest distillery. The Whisky Magazine, a British publication, has consistently given awards to Akuto\u2019s firm, Venture Whisky, and its range of \u201cIchiro\u2019s\u201d single malts now rival those from the bigger and more established Japanese distillers Suntory and Nikka.  This year, Akuto won first prize in the Japanese single malt single class category at the World Whiskies Awards. The 50-year-old traces Japan\u2019s newfound obsession with whisky to its long history of brewing sake. \u201cWe love perfecting the art of making things, so you could say we\u2019re quite geeky in that respect,\u201d he says. \u201cThat determination to do things right extends to whisky.\u201d     Venture Whisky uses two pot stills imported from Scotland Photograph: Justin McCurry for the Guardian    The comparison is particularly apposite in Akuto\u2019s case. His grandfather, a sake maker, was running the family\u2019s 300-year-old sake brewery when, on a whim, he decided to obtain a distiller\u2019s license a year after the second world war ended. Akuto\u2019s father continued to dabble in whisky making, using two stills imported from Scotland to produce about 400 casks. By 2000, however, the end of Japan\u2019s bubble economy and a decline in sake consumption forced the family to sell up. The sale, though, turned out to be the beginning of Ichiro Akuto\u2019s successful career as a distiller, after he snapped up the unwanted stills and casks of maturing whisky from the brewery\u2019s new owners. He launched Venture Whisky in 2008 and produced his first label \u2013 Ichiro\u2019s Vintage Single Malt 1988 \u2013 the following year. Much of the rest of the inherited stock went into Venture\u2019s award-winning \u201ccard\u201d series, with each small batch labelled with the name of a playing card.     Ichiro Akuto, president of Venture whisky, outside his distillery in Chichibu, Japan. Photograph: Justin McCurry for the Guardian    The whiskies sold out as soon as they went on sale, bought, in some cases, for tens of thousands of yen online by whisky enthusiasts. Some bottles in the series are now considered collector\u2019s items. Akuto achieved another milestone last year when a bottle of his 1960 Karuizawa single malt \u2013 made with whisky rescued from the family sake brewery - sold for a US$118,500 at an auction in Hong Kong, a record for a Japanese whisky.  The bottle sold at Bonhams was one of its kind just 41 in existence, but it is the whiskies - which cost anything from a few thousand yen to 100,000 yen or more - made exclusively at the Chichibu distillery that are reinforcing Japan\u2019s unlikely status as a whisky superpower. Most of the distillery\u2019s barley comes from Norfolk, with smaller quantities from Germany and Scotland, whose peaty tones initially struggled to win over Japanese drinkers more accustomed to lighter, floral flavours. Akuto is also experimenting with barley grown locally, a bold move that, if successful, promises to produce a genuinely Japanese whisky. The company produced 90,000 bottles of whisky last year, about half of which were for the international market, with the UK, France and Taiwan among its biggest customers. It has also started exporting to the US. \u201cIf we were interested in just making balanced, easy-to-drink whiskies then we would inevitably have to compete with Suntory and Nikka,\u201d says Yumi Yoshikawa, Venture\u2019s brand ambassador. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to do the opposite \u2013 making whiskies with character that are not necessarily balanced or easy to drink. That\u2019s how we\u2019re keeping our market share,\u201d adds Yoshikawa, whose love of the \u201cwater of life\u201d has taken her on study tours to 70 distilleries around the world over the past five years. Venture\u2019s older single malts of the future are maturing in 4,000 casks that once contained sherry from Spain and Portugal, wine from France and bourbon from the US. At the firm\u2019s in-house cooperage, lengths of Japanese oak are being turned into wholly domestic casks that will impart new flavours to its whiskies.     Casks of whisky at Venture Whisky\u2019s distillery in Chichibu, Japan Photograph: Justin McCurry for the Guardian    Chichibu\u2019s hot, humid summers and cold winters are ideally suited to whisky production, with the temperature variation exacerbated by the town\u2019s mountainous location. \u201cThat all makes for deep whisky maturation,\u201d Akuto says. The number of international awards going to Japanese whiskies underlines the dramatic progress the country\u2019s distillers have made since Masataka Taketsuru launched Suntory\u2019s Yamazaki distillery in 1923. As recently as the 1990s, whisky \u2013 usually the blended variety \u2013 was often drunk as highballs or watered down, mizuwari-style, in salaryman bars. Chichibu, though, is the closest Japan comes to a genuinely craft distillery, with a staff of 14 whose average age is just 30. \u201cWe\u2019re not competing with the big companies,\u201d says Akuto, who likens his enterprise to a lean sumo wrestler who, lacking the heft to bulldoze his opponents, must rely on faultless technique and a sense of adventure. \u201cYou could say that we\u2019re building our own, more exclusive sumo ring and keeping out the bigger guys out that way,\u201d he adds.     Bottles of whisky produced at Venture Whisky\u2019s distillery in Chichibu, Japan Photograph: Justin McCurry for the Guardian    He has ambitious plans for his distillery, including a 10 percent annual increase in sales and expanded premises. But he has no intention of selling his idiosyncratic whiskies in supermarkets or convenience stores; instead, their growing number of devotees must go online or buy directly from specialist suppliers, including high-end department stores. \u201cOur whiskies are relatively expensive, and they\u2019re intended to be drunk over time and savoured,\u201d says Akuto, whose next big project is to release a 10-year-old whisky to coincide with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, followed by a 30-year-old single malt made entirely in Chichibu. Judging by the reviews his tiny distillery has received so far, they will be worth the wait."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/aug/30/lord-goff-of-chieveley-obituary", "publicationDate": "2016-08-30T16:53:03Z", "tags": ["Law", "Hillsborough disaster", "Liverpool", "Football"], "sentences": ["In 1977 he ruled that it was unlawful to expel Taiwan from the International Badminton Association as a political expedient to allow China to be admitted.", "The decision allowed Taiwanese women to play in the Uber Cup, the women\u2019s world championship, in 1978."], "title": "Lord Goff of Chieveley obituary", "article": "While not as spectacular as the bushy eyebrows of his fellow law lord Lord Griffiths, Robert Goff\u2019s prominent moustache marked him as the epitome of the old-fashioned, upper-class gent. Indeed, the peer was described in one newspaper as having second world war movie hero looks coupled with brains. Goff, who has died aged 89, sat on many of the biggest cases of the past 30 years, including the government\u2019s efforts to ban the sale of the memoirs of the former MI5 agent Peter Wright in his book Spycatcher, litigation resulting from the Hillsborough disaster, and the extradition of the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. He was ennobled as Lord Goff of Chieveley on his appointment as a law lord, a lord of appeal in ordinary, in 1986, and he was the senior law lord from 1996 until his retirement in 1998. Ever forward-looking, he took the view that the law lords had greater freedom than the rest of the judiciary to \u201cmould and remould the authorities to ensure that practical justice is done within the framework of principle\u201d, and was particularly keen that they should deliver individual judgments rather than a joint one, believing this would lead to the further development of the law. In 1998 he dissented from the judgment of most of his fellow law lords that police officers could not sue for trauma suffered in the Hillsborough tragedy. He was also not afraid to extend the sometimes limited boundaries of the law by considering doctrines of other jurisdictions. In 1995, borrowing from German law, he held that a solicitor who had failed to draw up a will before his client died owed a duty of care to the proposed but then disappointed beneficiaries. He came out of retirement in 1999 to be part of a seven-man court to hear the former Chilean dictator General Pinochet\u2019s appeal against extradition to Spain on charges of crimes against humanity. Holding that Pinochet was entitled to immunity, Goff was the only judge to dissent from the ruling that Pinochet could be extradited. The majority decision was eventually overturned by the then home secretary, Jack Straw. Deceptively laid back, essentially kind and courteous to advocates and all who came across him, throughout his life he was a lover of all things Scottish.Born in Perthshire, the son of Lt Col Lionel Goff and Isobel (nee Denroche-Smith), he developed a love of reeling at an early age and could be found leading the dancing both at society balls and in local village halls. Robert was educated at Eton and his father wished his son to then have a military career, but he opted for law. He served in the Scots Guards for four years from 1944 before completing his education at New College, Oxford, where he gained a first in jurisprudence.  He was called to the bar in 1951, joining Inner Temple, and became a member of Sir Ashton Roskill\u2019s chambers in 1956. However, he had not immediately left Oxford. He became a fellow and tutor at Lincoln College, where, with Professor Gareth Jones, he began to write The Law of Restitution, developing the hitherto rather sneered-upon concept of \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d. It became the leading textbook on the doctrine. When he did finally enter chambers, his practice was almost exclusively a commercial one, with a leaning towards admiralty work. In 1969 he successfully appeared for the industrialist Sir Bernard Docker, who had sold his yacht to the property developer Harry Hyams. The latter had paid a deposit and then tried to serve a notice alleging \u00a3100,000 of defects in the boat. Goff was able to show the defects had amounted to a mere \u00a3100 and had been immediately rectified. He was appointed a recorder in 1974, and the next year a high court judge sitting in the Queen\u2019s bench division. In 1977 he ruled that it was unlawful to expel Taiwan from the International Badminton Association as a political expedient to allow China to be admitted. The decision allowed Taiwanese women to play in the Uber Cup, the women\u2019s world championship, in 1978. The same year, he ruled that \u201ccarrying away\u201d is sufficient to sustain a charge of kidnapping. The kidnapper did not now have to reach his or her intended destination, as had previously been thought. In 1989 Goff ruled that it would be lawful for doctors to carry out a sterilisation of a 36-year-old woman with a serious mental disability who was incapable of giving her consent. In 1993 this doctrine was extended. Anthony Bland, who was in a permanent vegetative state following the Hillsborough disaster, was the first patient under English law to be allowed to die through the withdrawal of life-prolonging treatment. Goff became a lord justice of appeal and a member of the privy council in 1982. That year he was part of the court that ruled there need be no new inquest into the New Cross fire that had killed 13 young black people at a party. The open verdict had been challenged on the basis that the coroner had tape-recorded the proceedings rather than making handwritten notes.

In 1983 he held that the deliberate sniffing of a gluestick before driving was sufficient to warrant a conviction under the Road Traffic Act. In 1987 he was a member of the judicial committee of the House of Lords when, in a judgment that anticipated the present-day celebrity injunctions, it was held to be pointless to grant or continue an injunction when the information the plaintiff wished to prevent becoming public knowledge was already in the public domain.

The ministry is seeking 5.17 trillion yen (\u00a338bn) for the year beginning in April 2017. That marks an increase of 2.3% from last year, and is the fifth annual increase since Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, came to power in late 2012 vowing to bolster the military to address a surge in Chinese naval activity and North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. The latest budget request marks a continuation in the shift in focus away from Japan\u2019s northern maritime border with Russia \u2013 where cold war Soviet forces once posed a threat \u2013 to an 870-mile chain of southern outlying islands stretching from the Japanese mainland towards Taiwan. Much of the hardware on the defence ministry\u2019s shopping list is designed to counter potential threats to Japanese territory in the East China Sea, including the disputed Senkaku islands, which are also claimed by Beijing. At the heart of the strategy is the development of a mobile amphibious force \u2013 modelled on the US marine corps \u2013 that would be able to respond quickly to an attempt to invade the Senkakus, which China refers to as Diaoyu. In the single biggest outlay, the ministry wants more than 100bn yen to upgrade Japan\u2019s Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missiles, seen as the last line of defence against a nuclear or conventional attack by North Korea. The sense of urgency in Tokyo over missile defence is growing amid evidence that North Korea is making progress in its attempts to build reliable ballistic missiles capable of reaching Japan, including those launched from submarines. The improvements will dramatically enhance the PAC-3\u2019s range and its ability to target incoming missiles. The Senkakus are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and potentially huge oil and gas deposits. The uninhabited islets are administered by Japan, but Chinese vessels have stepped up incursions into waters near the territories in recent months.

Photograph: Aflo/Barcroft    To improve Japan\u2019s ability to patrol the islands, ministry officials want to spend 95bn yen on six Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth fighters, as well as more than 90bn yen on four Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and six Boeing Chinook twin-rotor helicopters. Incursions by Chinese planes into Japanese airspace near the Senkakus were met with a record number of scrambles by Japanese fighter planes between April and June, while Tokyo continued to resist Beijing\u2019s requests for talks on the dispute. This month, the Japanese foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, summoned China\u2019s ambassador in Tokyo, Cheng Yonghua, to protest against Chinese maritime activity in the area, saying it had contributed to a \u201cmarked deterioration\u201d in Sino-Japanese ties. Last week, however, Kishida and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, agreed it was important to establish lines of communication to avoid accidents near the Senkakus that could quickly escalate into a conflict. \u201cWe reached a common recognition that we have to control friction at sea firmly through the efforts of both countries,\u201d Wang told reporters during a trilateral summit in Tokyo that also included South Korea\u2019s foreign minister. As a prominent member of a group of conservative politicians who believe the postwar constraints imposed on Japan\u2019s military are unfair and out of date, Abe wants the country\u2019s self-defence forces to play a bigger international role that includes possible involvement in overseas conflicts. Last summer, his governing coalition pushed through controversial security legislation that reinterpreted Japan\u2019s war-renouncing constitution to allow the armed forces to exercise its right to collective self-defence \u2013 or coming to the aid of an ally \u2013 for the first time since the end of the second world war. Despite the broader scope afforded Japanese troops by the new laws, speculation is mounting that Abe, whose coalition dominates both houses of parliament, will attempt to ditch article 9 of the US-authored constitution, which restricts Japan\u2019s military to a purely defensive role."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/05/pokemon-go-russian-youtuber-ruslan-sokolovsky-five-years-jail-church", "publicationDate": "2016-09-05T14:48:59Z", "tags": ["Pok\u00e9mon Go", "Pok\u00e9mon", "YouTube", "Games", "Technology", "Russia", "Europe", "World news"], "sentences": ["Pok\u00e9mon No: game\u2019s daily active users, downloads and engagement are down Man shot dead while playing Pok\u00e9mon Go in San Francisco Pentagon\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon orders: game must go (outside) for security reasons Hundreds of Pok\u00e9mon Go players fined for playing while driving in Taiwan "], "title": "Russian YouTuber facing five years in jail after playing Pok\u00e9mon Go in church", "article": "A Russian YouTuber could face five years in jail after he filmed himself playing Pok\u00e9mon Go in a church.

The researchers warn that global warming will lead the giant storms to become even stronger in the future, threatening the large and growing coastal populations of those nations. \u201cIt is a very, very substantial increase,\u201d said Prof Wei Mei, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who led the new work. \u201cWe believe the results are very important for east Asian countries because of the huge populations in these areas. People should be aware of the increase in typhoon intensity because when they make landfall these can cause much more damage.\u201d Typhoons can have devastating impacts in east Asia. In 2013, typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines, killing at least 6,300 people and affecting 11 million. Typhoon Nina struck China in 1975, dumping 100cm of rain in a day and leading to 229,000 deaths and 6m destroyed buildings. Last week typhoon Lionrock left 11 people dead in northern Japan and caused power blackouts and property damage, while in July typhoon Nepartak hit Taiwan and China, killing at least nine people and leaving a trail of destruction. In the new research, published in Nature Geoscience, the scientists took data collected independently by centres in Japan and Hawaii and, after accounting for differences in the way it had been collected, showed that typhoons in the north-west Pacific had intensified by 12\u201315% on average since 1977. The proportion of the most violent storms - categories 4 and 5 - doubled and even tripled in some regions over that time and the intensification was most marked for those storms which hit land. The intensity of a typhoon is measured by the maximum sustained wind speed, but the damage caused by its high winds, storm surges, intense rains and floods increases disproportionately, meaning a 15% rise in intensity leads to a 50% rise in destructive power.     People take cover under a tree after strong winds brought by typhoon Rammasun, locally called Glenda, battered Manila in the Philippines, July 2014. Photograph: Romeo Ranoco/REUTERS    The researchers showed that the intensification of typhoons making landfall occurred because warmer coastal seas provided more energy to growing storms, enabling their wind speeds to increase more rapidly. Scientists are not yet able to determine whether manmade climate change or natural cycles are to blame for the warming seas in the region because 40 years is a relatively short time span for such phenomena. But Wei is clear that the future global warming, as projected by the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, would heat the oceans in the region and lead to even more intense typhoons. Mei said: \u201cWe want to give the message that typhoon intensity has increased and will increase in the future because of the warming climate.\u201d He said action was needed to both prepare for future typhoons and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to curb warming: \u201cUnderstanding intensity change is very important for disaster preparation.\u201d Prof Kerry Emanuel, an expert on tropical cyclones at MIT and not involved in the new research said: \u201cThe results leave little doubt that there are more high intensity events affecting south-east Asia and China, and these are also intensifying more rapidly.\u201d \u201cThis is significant for these nations because what matters, in the end, is landfall size and intensity,\u201d he said. \u201cStronger storms cause higher storm surges, which often cause the most destruction and loss of life.\u201d Previous work by Emanuel showed tropical cyclones are likely to become more frequent and stronger if climate change is not curbed."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/06/new-zealand-tops-world-house-price-list", "publicationDate": "2016-09-06T17:51:47Z", "tags": ["House prices", "New Zealand", "Asia Pacific", "Money", "Business", "Housing market", "Property", "World news"], "sentences": ["Taiwan saw price falls of 9.4% over the past year, putting it at the bottom of Knight Frank\u2019s ranking.", "World\u2019s hottest and coldest property markets Top 10  Turkey 13.9% New Zealand* 11.2% Canada 10.0% Chile 9.4% Sweden 8.9% Malta 8.8% Austria 8.1% Iceland 8.1% Mexico 8.0% Germany 7.9%  Bottom 10  Taiwan -9.4% Ukraine -9.2% Hong Kong -8.1% Morocco -3.6% Greece -2.9% Singapore -2.4% Cyprus -1.6% Italy -1.2% Brazil -0.7% Japan -0.3%  Source: Knight Frank Research."], "title": "New Zealand tops world house price increase", "article": "New Zealand has the world\u2019s most frenetic property market, with prices in Auckland now outstripping London, and possibly dashing the hopes of British buyers hoping to escape Brexit.

The 37-year-old, who hails from the stubbornly landlocked hills of Derbyshire, has made a career of drawing and painting in the ocean. That\u2019s right: floating in the sea, using an old piece of plywood as a desk-cum-flotation aid and scrawling across huge sheets of paper with the charcoal pencils and gel pens that he keeps tucked under his hat.  \u201cMy mother\u2019s father sold fish in Leicester, so I like to think it\u2019s in my roots,\u201d says Matthews, currently in Taiwan where he\u2019s been bobbing about in the Pacific. \u201cI\u2019ve always had this profound fascination with the ocean.\u201d In 2007, in Mexico, he experienced a \u201clife-changing event\u201d while out surfing. \u201cI got hit by one of those rogue huge waves.

Matthews\u2019 canvas Photograph: Peter Matthews    It dawned on him afterwards, however, that waiting around in the water was where he was happiest: \u201cthat communion with the ocean\u201d. And so he swapped surfboard for hardboard and started immersing himself in the sea, often from dawn until dusk, trying to capture, consciously and subconsciously, that strange, suspended state.   Related: Europe's first underwater sculpture museum \u2013 in pictures    Looking at the resulting drawings, which Matthews often leaves in a tidepool overnight to work on again in the morning, it\u2019s tempting to draw comparison to the scratchy, abstract works of Cy Twombly or Jasper Johns. But there is also something of the alchemist to Matthews \u2013 his stream-of-consciousness texts, his lyrical way of speaking and his frankly eccentric work practice. \u201cBig grey seals often pop up,\u201d says Matthews, who has been working for years around the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall, wild-camping on the cliffs near Coverack. \u201cWhen I\u2019m exhausted and lie on the rocks to try and generate a bit of heat, the seals come up really close. Those unexpected things in nature are fascinating.\u201d It would be wrong to describe Matthews as a nature artist. Although his work is literally soaked in seawater and scattered with the imprint of small shellfish, he is far more interested in exploring the fluid midpoint between sea and land, thought and form.  \u201cThere\u2019s a period of time in the early morning and again at twilight that\u2019s beyond words,\u201d he says, his soft Derbyshire vowels still just about detectable. \u201cThat\u2019s when the scrawlings ignite. It\u2019s almost caveman-like. Approaching the ocean is quite mysterious in itself: seeing it, and that visceral experience of listening to it, smelling it, touching it.\u201d     5 Hours In and With the Atlantic Ocean #2 (England) Photograph: Peter Matthews/Courtesy of the artist    Of course, there are practical obstacles to working in the sea. As well as numb hands, the odd fall into a rockpool and concerned dogwalkers peering out at him on the horizon, Matthews has to contend with the unpredictability of waves. \u201cThere\u2019s a romantic side to me that\u2019s drawn to the wild, breaking white. But I\u2019ve also lost quite a lot of drawings that way,\u201d he tells me, as I try to picture this floating male selkie pulling pencils out of his sleeve like a magician. \u201cThe waves crash over, it tears off the board, and ebbs away into the abyss.\u201d Some of his works dance along the border of the brilliant and the ridiculous. For the piece With the Forces of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, Matthews rigged up a CD player on a floating tripod, then spent days bobbing about in the Atlantic, listening to a recording of the Pacific, trying to capture the watery confusion between the two. For A Mystical Exchange of Energies he sprayed nine litres of Pacific ocean, collected during typhoon Nanmodal in August 2011, into the Atlantic using a fire extinguisher \u2013 transferring one ocean into the other.

But the fine, cartographic drawings and philosophical way he speaks about changes in form are beautiful, intriguing, sometimes saturated with vulnerability. Perhaps is it absurd. Perhaps it is dangerous. Or perhaps floating in the ocean with a huge sea-soaked sheet of paper is as close as Matthews can get to what Keats called tracing with the magic hand of chance. \u201cI love how the sea writes itself,\u201d says Matthews. \u201cI\u2019m just following the ocean, really.\u201d \u2022 Nature, Here and Now is at St Mary\u2019s Church, Wirksworth, Derbyshire on 11-12 and 17-18 September, as part of the Wirksworth festival, until 25 September.

A study of 54 one-month-old cuttlefish hatched in captivity was carried out by Tsang-I Yang and Chuan-Chin Chiao, researchers at the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. Their findings suggest that cephalopods count potential prey such as shrimps, crab and fishes, and make several judgment calls in deciding whether or not to strike. Presented with different numbers of live shrimp, the cuttlefish showed consistent preference for the larger quantities, suggesting they had \u201cnumber sense\u201d.   Related: I, for one, welcome our new cephalopod overlords ... but what are they?    The researchers also found that the density of the group of the shrimp did not affect their decision, and that cuttlefish took longer to decide when the numbers were higher. This indicated that the cephalopods were taking time to count the individual shrimp of each option, rather than making an assessment at a glance. They pointed to similar studies of one-year-old humans, which found that babies could distinguish between one and two items, and two and three items, but no higher. Rhesus macaque monkeys could judge quantities of only up to four. With cuttlefish able to distinguish between one and five and four and five, the researchers concluded that they \u201care at least equivalent to infants and primates in terms of number sense\u201d. Given the choice between one live shrimp and two dead shrimp, the cuttlefish also opted for the smaller quantity. The researchers were particularly struck by their response to the choice between one large live shrimp and two small live shrimps, which depended on the state of their appetite. If the cuttlefish was hungry, it chose the single shrimp; if it was not hungry, it chose the two smaller shrimps.   Related: Zoology Notes 10: Cuttlefish can hide their electrical signals    The researchers concluded that this was a strategy of risk minimisation, with one shrimp in a group posing less of a threat than targeting one lone prey, and \u201cprobably an ecologically rational solution to the widespread problem of choice\u201d: \u201cFor example, humans become more risk tolerant in their monetary decisions, as they get hungry.\u201d The study on \u201cnumber sense and state-dependent valuation in cuttlefish\u201d was published by the Royal Society in late August. With the most complex brains of any invertebrate, cephalopods \u2013 a family that includes octopus and squid \u2013 are known for their sophisticated cognitive behaviours, including the ability to change colour in milliseconds. Earlier this year, Australian researchers found that cephalopod numbers the world over were steadily increasing, potentially as a result of warmer ocean temperatures and reduced fish populations."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/camerons-sheet-on-prices-of-everyday-goods-revealed", "publicationDate": "2016-09-12T12:17:47Z", "tags": ["David Cameron", "UK news", "Politics", "Conservatives", "Emily Thornberry"], "sentences": ["George W Bush was asked about the leaders of four world hotspots \u2013 Chechnya, Taiwan, India and Pakistan \u2013 in 1999 and could only name Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan."], "title": "Cameron's cheat sheet on prices of everyday goods revealed", "article": "David Cameron was kept up to date on the price of 20 king-size cigarettes and a pint of lager during his time as prime minister, a civil service crib sheet has revealed. The document, which has been handed to the Guardian, appears to have been designed to prepare the then prime minister for awkward questions from the media \u2013 with the price of bread, milk, coffee, diesel, unleaded and a single tube journey in central London also listed. But the savvy officials made one mistake: they used average prices, which helps explain why Cameron once came unstuck over the price of cheap bread.     Ministerial cheat sheet.    Asked the price of a value white loaf by LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari in 2013, the then Tory leader said it was \u201cwell north of a pound\u201d. He made it worse by offering a \u201clittle plug\u201d for Cotswold Crunch flour, and telling the presenter that he had a breadmaker \u201cwhich I delight in using\u201d. Ferrari told him that the price of a value white loaf was about 47p. Why did the prime minister get it so wrong? Perhaps because the crib sheet said the average price of a white loaf was \u00a31.23. The document, called the data dashboard, also included information about other facts that any good prime minister ought to have at their fingertips \u2013 like the rates of VAT and income tax, fuel and tobacco duty. Another page set out the disability living allowance, housing benefit and working tax credits, as well as GDP growth, unemployment rate and average earnings. However, Cameron was not kept up to date on the names of foreign leaders. Such a list might have come in useful for Emily Thornberry at the weekend.  The shadow foreign secretary accused Sky News of sexism after presenter Dermot Murnaghan asked her to name the French foreign minister and the leader of South Korea.  \u201cDon\u2019t start pub quizzing me, Dermot,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m not going to start answering your questions on this. \u201cDo you know what, what really upsets me about your attitude to me is that you do this with me. I don\u2019t remember you doing it with anybody else, you know.\u201d           Sky News presenter asks Emily Thornberry to name French foreign minister    Thornberry is not the only politician to have been embarrassed by her lack of general knowledge. George W Bush was asked about the leaders of four world hotspots \u2013 Chechnya, Taiwan, India and Pakistan \u2013 in 1999 and could only name Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan. Dan Quayle, the vice-president in George HW Bush\u2019s administration, came unstuck on spelling, wrongly correcting a 15-year-old\u2019s spelling of \u201cpotato\u201d to \u201cpotatoe\u201d. In the UK, others have fallen in the face of maths questions. In 1998, when the then schools minister Stephen Byers was asked what eight times seven was, he replied \u201c54\u201d.  More recently, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, had to admit he did not know the price of a pint of milk when asked on Newsnight by Jeremy Paxman."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/13/street-fighter-manila-cup-esports-philippines", "publicationDate": "2016-09-13T07:00:53Z", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Culture", "Game culture", "PlayStation", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox", "Xbox One", "PC", "Philippines", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["In the end, it\u2019s USA v Taiwan, Wong versus Bruce \u201cGamerbee\u201d Hsiang."], "title": "A Street Fighter in Manila: how eSports is kicking off in the Philippines", "article": "The room smells faintly of beer, dried sweat, Red Bull and several variants of Axe body spray. The air conditioning is no match for the humidity of the Philippines, and people waft their faces furiously with freebie cardboard fans from one of the event\u2019s sponsors. Strewn across a beanbag in front of the stage is Hiroyuki \u201cEita\u201d Nagata. One of the biggest stars in the Street Fighter pro-gaming scene, Nagata made it to the top eight of EVO 2016, the giant Las Vegas fighting game tournament. Yet, here he is, napping among fans. This is the Manila Cup, the most important fighting game tournament in the Philippines \u2013 and things work a little differently here.             One thing is for sure, however \u2013 everyone in the room is taking things seriously. The Philippines may be a small nation in terms of the global games industry, but it has a sizeable fighting game community, and now in its second year the Manila Cup is an ambitious event. From September 10 to 11, the capital hosted tournaments for a range of the latest fighting games such as Mortal Kombat XL, BlazBlue Chronophantasma Extend, and Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator. But the Philippines is Street Fighter V country, with almost 200 people signed up for that tournament alone. The Manila Cup is part of the global Capcom Pro Tour; winners get points that determine placement, and may lead to an appearance at the Capcom Cup in December. That\u2019s why the heavy hitters of the FGC are here \u2013 Ricki Ortiz, Justin Wong, and Kenneth \u201cK-Brad\u201d Bradley from Evil Geniuses, PandaTV\u2019s Xijie \u201cDark Jiewa\u201d Zeng, and Red Bull\u2019s Masato \u201cBonchan\u201d Takahashi, to name but a few. Unlike in other eSports, there are no invitation-only events or qualifiers. You sign up for the games you want, get divided into pools, and, like your gaming avatars, fight your way to the top. The tournament follows a double elimination format; lose your first game and you get sent to the losers bracket. Lose again and you\u2019re out. Given the format, there is a good possibility of slaying some giants, but a bigger one of getting slain yourself. Not that many mind; my friend Boni tells me, \u201cIt would be an honour to get bodied by Justin Wong.\u201d I\u2019m here as my friends Tzi and Billy have signed up for the Street Fighter V tournament, which has a P150,000 (\u00a32,400) grand prize. A paltry sum compared to tournaments like EVO, where prize money goes up to $100,000 (\u00a375,000), but still big money in a country where the minimum wage is barely $10 per day. I\u2019m a lowly button masher, a class of people for whom I understand there is a special circle of hell. This is my first fighting game tournament, and I\u2019m here solely for moral support.     From the left: Manila Cup competitors Justin Wong and Ricki Ortiz, Tala Wong, and YouTube personality Mike Ross. Photograph: Emile Garcia    Today\u2019s arena is the clubhouse of a posh neighbourhood \u2013 a gated community where everyone needs a gate pass to enter. Next to us in the registration queue are some of the members of Evil Geniuses (EG), one of the original and most popular pro-gaming teams. Ortiz and Wong are legends, along with YouTube personality Mike Ross. A friend eggs me on to ask for a photo with the pros while they\u2019re not busy. I relent. While English is my first language, it disintegrates in the presence of these greats. There are so many things I want to say to them \u2013 you\u2019re amazing, I love your show, you\u2019re my favorite Chun-Li player \u2013 but I settle for a photo. A kid, no more than 18 or 19 comes over to EG, fight stick, notebook and a scouring pad in hand. The latter he hands to Ross, who looks confused. The kid explains, using hand gestures, that it\u2019s a scrubber \u2013 \u201cscrub\u201d being gamer parlance for a bad player. It\u2019s a gag gift, a product of the Filipino fondness for wordplay. Ross laughs. Giddy with excitement, the kid asks Wong and Ortiz to sign his fight stick and notebook. It\u2019s probably one of the best days of his life, and it\u2019s doubtful he would be alone in feeling that. We\u2019re a small country in Southeast Asia; we don\u2019t expect the giants of the fighting game world to descend onto the Philippines en masse. Yet, here they are today, within picture-taking, autograph-signing reach.      The event starts an hour late, as most events do in the Philippines. Photograph: Emile Garcia    The event starts an hour late, as most events do in the Philippines. Everything here runs on \u201cFilipino time\u201d, a reflection of the laid-back, easygoing nature of the people. But there is a frenetic energy in the air as the pools for the different games begin, with two rows of monitors and PS4s on either side of the room. Select Street Fighter V games, usually ones where the foreign pros are playing, take place on the modest stage, streamed worldwide on Team Spooky\u2019s Twitch channel.  Tzi\u2019s pool starts first. His Ryu gets demolished by a Cammy player, sending him to the loser\u2019s bracket, which he doesn\u2019t recover from. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d he admits afterwards. \u201cToo much Overwatch\u201d. Billy fares a bit better, losing his first two matches with Nash, but scraping out of the loser\u2019s bracket with Ken. He gets one more match before he\u2019s eliminated. \u201cAt least someone went home because of me,\u201d he says with pride.  My friends have no illusions that they\u2019re going to beat beasts like Ryota \u201cKazunoko\u201d Inoue or K-Brad. While Billy, like many other local players, joined to test his skill level against the best local and global players, Tzi wanted to reawaken the long dormant competitive gamer in him. Losing is a humbling experience, but neither are despondent \u2013 they\u2019re only more determined to prepare for next year. Their parts over, we settle among the throng to watch the Top 32 in action. Chants are integral to the Filipino crowd experience, and there is pride in getting a chant going. When Wong\u2019s Karin uses her super, the whole crowd does her distinctive heiress laugh along with her, amusing the commentators. \u201cIt [Manila] doesn\u2019t get hype, it stays hype!\u201d commentator Ryan \u201cGootecks\u201d Gutierrez says on the Twitch stream. The crowd, as if to prove Gutierrez\u2019s point, does a round of the \u201cOle\u201d chant for local player Ron \u201cLimfiltration\u201d Lim.  The local geek community is notorious for their in-jokes \u2013 a mix of 90s pop culture references, internet memes and current events. The infamous \u201cTapusin!\u201d [Finish him] chant from \u201cGost Payter\u201d, a parody of the Yu Yu Hakusho anime so central to many a Filipino childhood, starts up for Don \u201cDon\u201d Gim, the only Filipino to make it to the Top eight of the Manila Cup. The chant reverberates throughout the venue, so loud that Gutierrez removes his noise-cancelling headset to try and figure out what we\u2019re all shouting. In a nutshell, this is the Filipino FGC \u2013 snarky, irreverent, raucous and undeniably passionate. The fact that a Filipino player has made it to the Top eight of the Manila Cup is big. Filipinos are known for beauty pageants, music and a foul-mouthed president; fighting game players, not so much. There are so few of us competing globally that Filipino-American pro players like Ryan \u201cFilipinoChamp\u201d Ramirez and Gerald \u201cFilipinoman\u201d Herrera have made being Filipino part of their gamer identities.  On the Twitch stream, Gutierrez, half of the eponymous \u201cExcellent Adventures of Gootecks and Mike Ross\u201d, mentions that someone asked him what Filipino players needed to do to compete with the Justin Wongs of the world. Play more and travel, Gutierrez responds. His answer reveals a fundamental problem when it comes to developing world class pro-gaming teams in the Philippines \u2013 a lack of funding and sponsorship. The Philippines is a developing country, and carries all the baggage of being classified as one. Corporate sponsorship isn\u2019t feasible; the goal of sponsoring professional gamers is global recognition, ie making sure that Twitch viewers in different continents can see your brand. Very few Filipino brands have global reach, and even then, they\u2019re not tech or energy drink brands, the typical sponsors for pro-gamers.     Street Fighter V is the key draw in the Manila Cup    Without steady financial backing, it\u2019s nearly impossible for a Filipino pro-gamer to pay for travel expenses to and from major tournaments in the United States and Japan. On top of that, Filipinos, unlike many of their Western counterparts, have to worry about visas. Getting a visa, especially to the United States, is no mean feat for the average Filipino, as embassy officials worry that we\u2019ll become illegal aliens, adding another barrier to the Philippines\u2019 pro-gaming dreams. We can\u2019t compete with the pros if we don\u2019t have the luxury to practice like the pros, and we can\u2019t do that if we\u2019re not getting backed like the pros. One by one, the big names bow out on Day Two. The journey ends for Bonchan and K-Brad at the Top 16; Li Wei \u201cOil King\u201d Lin with his memorable floral shorts, Ortiz, and Eita make it to the Top eight before they\u2019re eliminated. In the end, it\u2019s USA v Taiwan, Wong versus Bruce \u201cGamerbee\u201d Hsiang. When Wong, the most popular foreign player in the Philippines, hits Hsiang\u2019s Necalli with the EX version of Karin\u2019s Ressenha special attack, it\u2019s over. The crowd erupts into deafening cries of \u201cJustin Wong!\u201d and \u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d  Typically stony-faced during his matches, Wong stands up and pops a fist in the air before shaking Hsiang\u2019s hand. The childhood hero of so many, one of the men responsible for creating the pro-gamer dream and living it, raises his gold trophy above his head. It\u2019s raw, electric, utter chaos, and he\u2019s immediately swarmed by fans begging him to sign their fight sticks or pose with them for selfies. Everyone wants selfies with the pros. It\u2019s close to 9 pm when I finally get home. It\u2019s an understatement to say it\u2019s been a long and exhausting couple of days. Before I collapse for the night, I go on YouTube to look for tutorial videos. This tournament has helped me make up my mind about who I want to main: Dhalsim. I saw two players at Manila Cup using this classic SF2 character and on finding that his move-set is close to Seth\u2019s (very slippery), he appealed greatly to me. He also reminds me of Zenyatta, my main character in Overwatch. But after 48 hours of continual Street Fighter, that\u2019s a story \u2013 and a game \u2013 for another day."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/sep/14/super-typhoon-meranti-whips-up-wind-speeds-in-pacific-to-180mph", "publicationDate": "2016-09-14T20:30:23Z", "tags": ["Meteorology", "Tornadoes", "Taiwan", "China", "United States", "Europe", "Spain", "France"], "sentences": ["Related: Typhoon Meranti: Taiwan and China brace for biggest storm of 2016    Meranti packed sustained wind speeds of 180mph on Tuesday and a central pressure reading of 890mb \u2013 the lowest for a typhoon since the reading for the super-typhoon Megi in 2010, one of the most intense tropical cyclones on record."], "title": "Super-typhoon Meranti whips up wind speeds in Pacific to 180mph", "article": "While activity in the tropical Atlantic has been relatively quiet this week, across the Pacific the super-typhoon Meranti has become the strongest tropical cyclone of the year so far.

Meanwhile, across Europe, summer refused to depart this week as temperatures soared to near record levels across France and Spain. A combination of low pressure anchored out across the Atlantic and high pressure across mainland Europe caused hot air to be drawn from north Africa into parts of west Europe.  Temperatures in southern Spain last week reached 45C (113F), with 38C recorded in Dax, south-west France. This is about 14C above the average for September. Much cooler weather looks set to replace the very hot conditions over the coming days as low pressure sweeps in from the west.

The 48-year-old, who was born in Japan to a Taiwanese father and Japanese mother, is expected to give her party a temporary boost, following a run of poor election results. Murata \u2013 known simply as Renho \u2013 said the party\u2019s priority was to re-establish itself as a serious alternative to the Liberal Democratic party (LDP), which together with its junior coalition partner dominates both houses of parliament. \u201cFrom here on, we face a giant ruling party,\u201d she said after the vote. \u201cI\u2019d like to call on everyone to join me in creating a party that does not criticise but makes proposals ... so that one day we will become Japan\u2019s choice.\u201d Murata is the third woman to attain high political office in Japan in the past two months, although women are still woefully under-represented in the country\u2019s parliament. In July, Yuriko Koike was elected governor of Tokyo, and immediately confronted the city\u2019s bureaucracy by postponing the relocation of Tsukiji market \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest fish market \u2013 due to concerns over soil contamination at the new site. Last month, Tomomi Inada, a rightwinger who has been tipped as a future prime minister, became Japan\u2019s second defence minister. Their appointments were made against a background of gender imbalance. According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, women make up less than 10% of MPs in the lower house of Japan\u2019s parliament, and 20% of those in the upper house. Inada is one of only three women in the 20-strong cabinet of the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, whose mission to fill 30% of public and private sector leadership positions with women by 2020 has got off to a disappointing start. Murata, a former swimsuit model who worked as a journalist before being elected to parliament in 2004, seized the opportunity to lead the Democrats after the former leader, Katsuya Okada, said he was stepping down in the wake of the party\u2019s poor performance in July\u2019s upper house elections. During its three years in government from 2009, the party was criticised for mishandling the planned relocation of a US marine base on the southern island of Okinawa and for its response to the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011. The party, whose MPs include an uneasy mix of liberal and conservative defectors from other parties, has never recovered from its heavy general election defeat in late 2012. A poll by the Asahi Shimbun this week showed support for the LDP at 40%, with the Democrats on just 7%. Murata\u2019s attempts to rebuild the party\u2019s credibility got off to a shaky start, just hours before her expected victory was confirmed on Thursday. Questioned by reporters, she acknowledged that she still held Taiwanese nationality, despite earlier claiming that she had become a naturalised citizen of Japan in 1985 at the age of 17. \u201cI would like to apologise for the confusion caused by my inaccurate recollection of what happened and the contradictions in my recent remarks,\u201d she said, before confirming that she identified herself as Japanese. \u201cI\u2019ve always worked for the good of this, my own country, and I\u2019ll continue to do so,\u201d she said. Japanese law requires people with dual nationality to choose one or the other before they reach the age of 22, although failure to do so is not a crime. Many retain dual nationality under a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy. The nationality debacle is likely to be seized on by her opponents, however. The conservative Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper described Murata\u2019s confusion over her nationality as a \u201csorry state of affairs\u201d. Despite her assurances this week that she had taken steps to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship, the newspaper said in an editorial: \u201cIt is out of the question for a legislator \u2013 who is supposed to serve the interests of the nation, including in foreign affairs and national security \u2013 to leave their own nationality obscure.\u201d The Yomiuri suggested that some might question her loyalty to Japan, particularly over foreign policy issues where it is in disagreement with Taiwan. \u201cAlthough Taiwan is friendly towards Japan, it is in conflict with the Japanese standpoint regarding some issues, for instance, its ownership claims on the Senkaku islands,\u201d the paper said. \u201cIf Renho retains her Taiwan citizenship, she could become the target of undesirable suspicions regarding her relations with Taiwan.\u201d  The Senkakus are administered by Japan but also claimed by China and Taiwan. During her leadership campaign, Murata vowed to protect the war-renouncing article of Japan\u2019s postwar constitution, as speculation mounts that Abe will use his party\u2019s big parliamentary majority to trigger changes that would end the military\u2019s strictly defensive role."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/15/marshall-islands-climate-change-springdale-arkansas", "publicationDate": "2016-09-15T10:00:39Z", "tags": ["Marshall Islands", "Climate change", "Environment", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "US news", "Arkansas"], "sentences": ["Majuro\u2019s police station, courts and street lighting were funded by Japan and Taiwan, the latter country getting Marshallese recognition in the UN in return."], "title": "Lives in the balance: climate change and the Marshall Islands", "article": "   There may be music in the roar of the sea, as Byron eulogized, but the waves can also bring creeping unease.

Surprisingly, the largest Marshallese community has gathered not in New York or Los Angeles, but around Springdale, an unremarkable corner of Arkansas.  Better job prospects and a college education are major pulls, but climate change is now elbowing its way on to the list of considerations. A third of the Marshall Islands\u2019 60,000-strong population now resides in the US and some of those left behind fret that many more will follow, with the archipelago\u2019s unique culture blemished by each departure. The Marshallese government has openly worried \u201cabout massive outmigration in recent years\u201d \u2013 a fifth of the population left between 1999 and 2011. As the seas rise, the pathway to the US could be closing. A compact of free association, which allows Marshallese people to live and work in the US without a visa, ends in 2023 and there are no guarantees it will be extended. Those already living in the US would be able to stay but, if the agreement isn\u2019t extended, those living in the Marshall Islands will be treated like hopeful migrants from any other country.     Unemployment in the Marshall Islands is about 36% and many chose to leave in search of employment in the US. Photograph: Mae Ryan for the Guardian    The looming expiration of the American deal means there is a \u201cconcern that more people will leave, definitely\u201d, Heine concedes. \u201cIt\u2019s hard being in competition with the United States. But I don\u2019t think we should give up. These are our homes.\u201d While the Marshall Islands would fulfill most aesthetic criteria for an island paradise, it\u2019s easy to see why this selection of 29 coral limestone and sand atolls and five islands, strewn across 750,000 sq miles of ocean, are so vulnerable to an ocean that is advancing due to melting glaciers and thermal expansion. The islands are arranged in broken arcs around large lagoons. The islands are coin-flat and incredibly narrow \u2013 at some points just a dozen yards separate one coast from the other.  Water is, claustrophobically, everywhere. Its handiwork is evident even in its absence \u2013 graves that are sliding into the sea and spilling bones on to what remains of the beach, the Sisyphean labour of repatching flood defenses, the gnawed-away coastline releasing the determined grip of precipitously angled trees, one root at a time.  In 2014, after five-meter swells inundated Majuro for the third time in a year (historically, something that only happened once every few decades), the US Geological Survey released sobering research that shows that a mix of sea level rise and marauding waves means \u201cmany atoll islands will be flooded annually, salinizing the limited freshwater resources and thus likely forcing inhabitants to abandon their islands in decades, not centuries, as previously thought\u201d.   Majuro Atoll   The escape route is there, for now, but it has come at a cost. The option of moving to the US was born from the Marshall Islands\u2019 misfortune of being under US administration during the cold war.  Between 1946 and 1958, the US conducted nuclear weapons testing on the islands, peppering Bikini atoll alone with 23 bombs. The largest, known as the Bravo shot, was 1,000 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb and vaporized three small islands. While Bikini was evacuated, the wind blew radioactive detritus on to the inhabited atolls of Rongelap and Utrik. \u201cWithin hours, the atoll was covered with a fine, white, powder-like substance,\u201d says Jeton Anjain, who led the eventual evacuation of Rongelap. \u201cNo one knew it was radioactive fallout. The children played in the snow. They ate it.\u201d        Cancers, particularly of the thyroid, riddled many of those who came into contact with this radioactivity. But the wounds of dispossession are the ones that run deepest, 70 years on. The Marshallese may use faded US dollar bills, daub murals of LeBron James and Steph Curry on walls and retain the names Rita (after Rita Hayworth) and Laura (after Lauren Bacall) for the two ends of the curved Majuro island, but the relationship with America is a complicated one.  A US military base remains at Kwajalein, where unarmed missiles periodically land, fired from California. Many Marshallese serve in the US army, while the rest of the population each gets around $500 a year via a trust fund set up to compensate the harrowing nuclear tests. Still, many feel it\u2019s not enough given the legacy of trauma.  \u201cIt appalls me the way the US has treated the Marshallese people out here,\u201d says Jack Niedenthal, a native Pennsylvanian who came to the Marshall Islands with the Peace Corps in 1981 and never left.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a really dark spot, I think, in US history. In my mind, the cold war was really fought and won by the United States on the shores of Bikini.\u201d     A child plays in a cemetery on Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands. With the increase in King Tides, some cemeteries on the island are being washed out to sea. Photograph: Mae Ryan for the Guardian    Lani Kramer\u2019s grandmother was moved from Bikini as a 12-year-old. Along with other evacuees, she was dropped on to Kili, a sparse, unforgiving place that felt nowhere like home. Today, more than 800 people are crammed into a scrap of land barely a mile long, a place that depends on regularly shipped containers of food to survive. \u201cNo one from the US government has ever come to Kili and asked us: \u2018Are you guys doing OK, what can we do for you guys?\u2019\u201d says Kramer, who relentlessly ear-bashes American officials as an advocate for the Bikinian people. A lack of a US-funded cancer clinic is a particular frustration. \u201cIt was so easy for them to spend millions of dollars to do the testing but why is it so hard to help the people that they moved off of Bikini atoll? A lot of people are very upset.\u201d Kramer is part of a relatively influential Marshallese clan \u2013 her husband is a leading construction magnate in Majuro. But a comfortable life in the US won\u2019t represent home, just like Kili doesn\u2019t now. The prospect of climate change finishing off what nuclear bombs started fills her with horror.  \u201cWhen the next uprising from the sea comes and washes away all the crops and stuff from people\u2019s houses, then what?\u201d she says. \u201cWe are going to go under. The water is going to keep coming up and we\u2019re going to have nowhere else to go. We\u2019re going to have no place.\u201d      Children play volleyball in Majuro where the minimum wage is $2 and half the population is under 24. Photograph: Mae Ryan for the Guardian    The Marshall Islands are so remote that they make you feel like a reasonably well-equipped castaway. Everything needs to be imported, meaning that tasks such as car repairs are expensive and often left to fester.  The need for speed isn\u2019t pressing given that Majuro, where half the population lives, has just one proper road, connecting two hotels, two ATMs, a couple of restaurants. The heat can be blistering all year round. Life proceeds at a plod, the cars trundling along at barely 15mph, the friendly populace showing few signs of impatience or haste.  The minimum wage is just $2 and that is if you are lucky \u2013 the unemployment rate is around 36%. The country produces coconuts and breadfruit, and sells fishing licenses for the international trawlers that scour Marshallese waters for tuna, but it leans heavily upon the aid of others. Majuro\u2019s police station, courts and street lighting were funded by Japan and Taiwan, the latter country getting Marshallese recognition in the UN in return.  Half of the Marshall Islands population is aged under 24 and many inevitably wonder how life would play out in the US, even if it is cloaked in the language of duty. Family bonds are sprawling yet iron-clad in Marshallese culture \u2013 moving countries is largely aimed at helping the family thrive financially or socially. \u201cA lot of people feel like the United States is the promised land, and that\u2019s where a lot of them wind up going,\u201d says Niedenthal, the former Peace Corps member who has helped administer the trust fund for years but is now packing up his office, disillusioned. \u201cMost times they buy one-way tickets. It\u2019s not a great thing to say, but to me, it\u2019s almost hopeless. \u201cI think this place is going to be gone. I feel like I\u2019m going to be one of the last people to leave. If the roads get so bad that you can\u2019t drive any more, and the people\u2019s houses keep getting washed away, I just think people will start leaving en masse.\u201d       * * * It\u2019s a big weekend in Springdale, Arkansas. Not only is it the Marshallese constitution day \u2013 which marks the country\u2019s independence in 1986 \u2013 but it will be the first celebration to feature a beauty pageant, where young women will wear traditional clothing, read poetry and sing. In an office located in a retail strip opposite the town hall, a clutch of young women of Marshallese descent are getting ready for the parade that will kick off the celebrations. As they get into their Marshallese flag dresses (ratak, meaning \u201csunrise\u201d, and r\u0101lik, \u201csunset\u201d, are the central elements of the national emblem) the room is filled with teenage American accents talking about teenage American things. One girl plays the Silento song Watch Me on her cellphone.   Map of Little Rock   Springdale is almost the polar opposite of the Marshall Islands \u2013 it\u2019s in a landlocked state, riven with large highways and chain stores in the foothills of the Ozark mountains. But the Marshallese community, now numbering around 10,000, remains close-knit.  Legend has it they congregated at this unlikely, nondescript place because of a pioneer named John Moody, who moved to the area first through education and then work in the 1970s.  Moody toiled for nearly 20 years in the Tysons poultry plant, gutting and packing chickens. The work was smelly and dangerous \u2013 Moody lost the tip of his index finger to a factory saw \u2013 but the pay was a major upgrade on the Marshall Islands. Tysons, along with fellow chicken producer George\u2019s, remains a major employer of Marshallese people in Springdale. Walmart\u2019s headquarters, located up the road in Bentonville, is another major feature of the local economy. The Marshallese are an object of curiosity here, but are largely accepted by a population that has has become more diverse in recent years. White, Latino and Marshallese students rub shoulders at the Har-Ber high school in Springdale, where the Marshallese passion for basketball is well appreciated. \u201cIf they were taller than 5ft 3in we\u2019d have the best team around,\u201d the basketball coach admits, a little ruefully.  Melines Morris, who moved to Springdale from the Marshall Islands as a five-year-old, says she is often confused for a Hawaiian person.     Teenagers get ready for the first Marshallese beauty contest in Springdale, Arkansas. This year\u2019s theme is climate change. Photograph: Mae Ryan for the Guardian    \u201cThe Hispanic kids, they was like: \u2018What\u2019s up Hawaiiana?\u2019\u201d Morris, now 18, says. \u201cI\u2019m just like: \u2018No, I\u2019m Marshallese. I\u2019m from the Marshall Islands. You can call me marshmallow.\u2019\u201d Like many Marshallese in Springdale, Morris\u2019s family is fractured. Her mother\u2019s side of the family came to Arkansas but her father stayed in the Marshall Islands, where he has been ever since, speaking to his daughter over Skype or Facebook. Morris was plunged into a new reality, a world of McDonald\u2019s and Valentine\u2019s day and Hanukkah, without being able to speak English. But she is now what many people would expect of a stereotypical American teen. \u201cWhen I first started here, I always wanted to tell myself \u2018I\u2019m American\u2019, because I thought it was really cool coming here and then seeing new faces,\u201d she says. \u201cAs I grew up, I knew more about my culture, and then I really liked it. I was telling myself: \u2018Wow, I\u2019m blessed to have this culture.\u2019\u201d Morris now attempts to straddle both worlds, of Snapchat and of Marshallese customs on clothing and behavior, as well as celebrations such as kemem, a big bash thrown at the first birthday of a child. She says she was \u201cvery angry\u201d when she heard about what climate change was doing to the Marshall Islands and wants to go back to help \u2013 but not to live. Arlynda Jonas, 23, is also inclined to stay in the US. Like Morris she has an American accent, which she says some Marshallese people tease her about.  \u201cI feel like I\u2019m more towards the American side than my Marshallese side but I know that I should be on my Marshallese side more strongly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard. I don\u2019t want to forget my culture, my heritage or anything.\u201d At the Constitution Day parade in Springdale, the tone is a little more defiant. The celebrations have been given a climate change theme, giving the occasion more of a protest than a party feel. Banners proclaim \u201c70 years of exile\u201d for the Bikinian people and \u201c1.5 to stay alive\u201d, referring to the global temperature rise that can\u2019t be breached if the Marshall Islands is to survive. Candies are tossed to onlooking children as the parade passes by. Kenneth Kedi, speaker of the Marshallese parliament, is in Springdale to address the crowd. Kedi decries the salt-soaked soils of home, ruined for crops, and the disastrous drought. Climate change \u201cisn\u2019t shenanigans, it\u2019s reality\u201d, Kedi says. Kedi spent six years in the US and is now putting his son through school here. But he says he has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about the diaspora, as he inspects a lei filled with candies that has been placed around his neck. \u201cThey\u2019re losing their identity as Marshallese,\u201d he says of the Springdale community. \u201cThis is what we fear and our chiefs fear will happen, and it\u2019s happening.\u201d He moved back to the Marshall Islands because he loves his country, he says, but \u201cnow, that train is reversing\u201d.     Marshallese men and women celebrate Constitution Day in Springdale, Arkansas. Photograph: Mae Ryan for the Guardian    Kedi, a soft-spoken man, worries that more people will flee as climate change starts to bite deeper into the fabric of Marshallese life. That they will probably move to the US is \u201cbittersweet\u201d, he says. \u201cWe believe we have been given a bad deal,\u201d he says. \u201cWe make a minuscule contribution to the climate greenhouse effect but we are at the very frontline of the problems of climate change.\u201d He adds that plutonium stored at Enewetak, one of the Marshallese islands, is starting to leak into the ocean \u2013 yet another American legacy. \u201cSo, yeah, we\u2019re getting a bad deal,\u201d he says. \u201cWe certainly are getting a bad deal.\u201d Before the beauty pageant begins there is a lengthy church service. Marshallese people are often deeply religious \u2013 most of the population is Protestant. Large sections of the address is in Marshallese but at one point the pastor blurts out in English while referencing climate change: \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Pageant contenders read out poems on climate change. One has the anguished line: \u201cWe are losing our island, where will we stand?\u201d Another offers: \u201cKeep your faith in God.\u201d There follows dancing, singing and intricate, beautiful Marshallese gowns. Eventually, as we near 1am and even Marshallese patience is wearing thin, Arlynda Jonas is crowned the winner. It\u2019s a Marshallese triumph rooted in America. Jonas would be sad if the Marshall Islands were eaten away by the waves but can see an obvious solution for the country\u2019s people. \u201cIt would be great if they did all move [to the US] because there are just so many opportunities for them here, you know?\u201d she says. \u201cI think it would be great for them to move here.\u201d Back in Majuro, there are people who have to weigh whether to stay or go every day. For those who don\u2019t have the means or desire to relocate to the US, the future is particularly precarious.     A child plays with trash in Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands, where 20,000 people live. Photograph: Mae Ryan for the Guardian    Marlyna Laibwij, a teaching assistant in the community of Laura, has seen her neighbours abandon their coastal homes and move inland. Shells of concrete caked in vegetation dot this stretch of Majuro. Laibwij says the increasing flooding made her \u201csick because of worrying\u201d. Earlier this year, after the waters yet again lapped at the walls of her family home, she pleaded with the local mayor for help. He organized the construction of a sea wall, essentially rocks bundled in bags. It has provided some temporary relief.  \u201cI would have abandoned my house but I would have missed it very much,\u201d Laibwij says. \u201cI loved my home and I didn\u2019t want to abandon it. \u201cLife is getting hard, and I believe that all of these [changes] come from the same thing, from climate change.\u201d Should the waves advance further, however, Laibwij isn\u2019t sure if her family could remain. As we leave her house, in a moment of tender devastation, she confides: \u201cI think we can be here for another year or two. That\u2019s what I think. What do you think? Do you think we can be here that long?\u201d        Graphics and additional reporting by Jan Diehm  Support the Guardian\u2019s independent journalism by making a contribution or becoming a member "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/21/taiwan-asks-google-blur-images-military-structures-taiping-island", "publicationDate": "2016-09-21T08:47:08Z", "tags": ["Taiwan", "China", "South China Sea", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["Taiwan has asked Google to blur images of new military structures that have recently appeared on the hotly contested Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.", "Satellite pictures on Google Earth and Google Maps show four large three-pronged structures surrounding a circular building on the western coastline of Itu Aba, or Taiping Island, which is controlled by Taiwan but also claimed by China, Vietnam and the Philippines.", "Both China and Taiwan rejected the ruling.", "The handling of Taiwan\u2019s control of Taiping over China\u2019s sovereignty claims has become one of the testing grounds of the new administration of President Tsai Ing-wen, who swept to power in January.", "Google confirmed that it had received the request from the Taiwanese government and was reviewing it."], "title": "Taiwan asks Google to blur images of military structures on island", "article": "Taiwan has asked Google to blur images of new military structures that have recently appeared on the hotly contested Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.

Because the good stuff is such a bespoke operation \u2013 if you find a sushi place with more than 20 seats, shake your head sagely and move on \u2013 they tend to occupy a quiet spot in the hungry conversation. A restaurant with, say, nine seats doesn\u2019t need to make that much noise to fill them, as long as they are good. I keep being told of a tiny restaurant in the suburbs of a Midland\u2019s town, established because of a nearby car plant full of Japanese salarymen who need their fix, that deserves my attention. I hear whispers of airing-cupboard-sized places in the south London suburbs with a blond-wood bar that seats just six. I\u2019m told that\u2019s where the serious raw fish action is. But it\u2019s hard to be sure. At the top end of sushi, at the place where the most perfectly fashioned and wielded knife meets the most perfectly sourced and kept fish, the difference between \u201cMeh!\u201d and \u201cOh My!\u201d can seem so very slight.

Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Observer    I have heard talk about Umezushi in Manchester for a while now, but only as a light murmur, as if those speaking are desperate not to give away the secret. Unfortunately, I\u2019m a journalist; giving away secrets is my job. Four years ago, when it first opened, it would have been reasonable to assume Umezushi\u2019s site was chosen specifically to avoid attention or, indeed, custom of any kind. It occupies a tight railway arch down below Manchester Victoria station. Mirabel Street is a pretty name for a bit of industrial rough trade, all grimy blackened brick and knackered lock-up. It\u2019s a crime scene waiting to happen.    The wakame has a huge savoury-sour whack from the festering place on the beach where sea meets sand    But the centre of Manchester continues to expand and now it\u2019s starting to look like an inspired choice. The city has wandered down to Umezushi. Inside it\u2019s all deeply varnished blond wood and calm. There is table seating for 10 with space for another four at a counter before an open kitchen. Apparently it\u2019s owned by a chap from Taiwan. The cooks are from Korea and, on the day we were there, Spain and the Czech Republic. The skills, they told me, have been learned here on the job. This makes sense. The Czech Republic is not hugely famous for its sushi traditions. At this point I should define terms. This is not the very finest sushi in the land, but it really is very good indeed and, at the price, a bit of a miracle. We asked them to throw everything they had at us and received a bill for \u00a3110 for two. You could eat very well for half that. Nigiri sushi is around \u00a34 per two pieces, with a large sushi set at \u00a323.50. Or there\u2019s an express lunch for around a tenner a head. The good signs start with their own sweet-sour pickled ginger, which is not Barbie pink. It is a healthy oatmeal colour, with the tattered, fibrous edges of the home-sliced stuff. There are crunchy pieces of pickled radish. There\u2019s a tight knot of slippery wakame with a huge savoury-sour whack from the festering place on the beach where sea meets sand.     \u2018With staring eye and jaw\u2019: roasted salmon head. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Observer    Most importantly, there is the rice, which is lightly vinagered and served just warm enough to let the flavours play out. The grains hold together without being mush. I was once told that sushi is really all about the rice. It\u2019s not all about the rice, but the rice is bloody important. Somebody here has given the matter their attention. We begin with sashimi, including neatly cut pieces of sweet scallop and tuna, laid prettily across shredded mooli. Next the first of the nigiri, the best of which is scorched sea bream, the hastily applied heat encouraging the lubricious oils to run. A dainty pile of tobiko \u2013 micro fish roe \u2013 gives a hit of salt and sea. There is salmon and more tuna, each decorated with micro herbs which indicate somebody cares about looks. There\u2019s glazed and grilled eel, still warm to the touch. It\u2019s a punctuation mark of caramel flavours against the subtlety of the others. Slices of wagyu, sensitively flamed, almost justify the \u00a310 price tag that accompanies eating the Audrey Hepburn of steak. It is a cheerful, buttery hit of dribbling animal fat. A king prawn hand-roll disappoints. The prawn is a sizeable beast, but it\u2019s wrapped in enough rice to re-sculpt Devil\u2019s Tower from Close Encounters of the Third Kind. California rolls of crab are a little moist in the centre, but good all the same. The specials board offers roasted salmon head and hake collar. We order both and watch as, between tending to our raw fish needs, they turn the cuts over hot coals until the skin is blistered and the flesh underneath has steamed in its own moisture.     \u2018The very thing for cheap lunches when winter comes\u2019: Taiwanese pork rice. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Observer    The fish arrive on the plate looking like themselves: here, half a salmon head with staring eye and jaw; there, the collar of a hake with the curving bits of cartilage just before the gills. It\u2019s a lesson in waste management \u2013 don\u2019t throw anything away. They also tell us that the good stuff may require a little more work to get to. We pull at the sweet pearly flesh of the hake with our fingers; scrape along the curve of the salmon jaw with the pad of one thumb to pull away the treasures. These are the rarely explored regions of the fish that work the hardest, hence they taste the best. The skin is crisp and salty and releases its oils obligingly. The express lunch menu includes a dish of Taiwanese braised belly pork across rice, also available as a small side. It is a big, sticky bowl of sweet, salty, sticky pig and will be the very thing for cheap lunches when winter comes. It is truly well-sauced pork. You get the message by now.

Elected president of Taiwan in a landslide victory, she took office in May, buoyed by high approval ratings. Yet in a few short months, Tsai\u2019s popularity has plunged by 25%. The reason may be summed up in one word: China. Suspicious that Tsai\u2019s Democratic Progressive party, which also won control of parliament, harbours a pro-independence agenda, Beijing suspended official and back-channel talks with its \u201crenegade province\u201d and shut down an emergency hotline. More seriously, for many Taiwanese workers, China also curbed the lucrative tourist trade, which brought millions of mainland visitors to the island during the accommodating presidency of Tsai\u2019s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou. Cross-strait investment and business have also been hit. Tsai faces contradictory pressures. The public wants the benefit of closer economic ties with China but Beijing\u2019s intentions are rightly distrusted by a population that increasingly identifies itself as Taiwanese, not Chinese. Given President Xi Jinping\u2019s ominous warnings that reunification cannot be delayed indefinitely, China\u2019s military build-up and hawkish suggestions that Beijing may resort to force, Taiwanese ambivalence is wholly understandable. This dilemma \u2013 how to work constructively with a powerful, assertive China without compromising or surrendering national interests \u2013 grows steadily more acute. It is shared by states across the east and southeast Asian region. From Indonesia and the Philippines to Vietnam, Japan, Seoul, Malaysia and Singapore, the quandary is the same. But the answers proffered by national leaders are different and sometimes sharply at odds. The China dilemma is felt strongly in Washington. The US has striven in recent years to strengthen Asian alliances, increase trade and raise its regional military profile \u2013 Barack Obama\u2019s so-called rebalance or pivot to Asia \u2013 in a bid to contain and channel China\u2019s ambitions peacefully. But analysts say the pivot appears to be in trouble. For Europeans fixated on Syria and immigration, this may not seem especially worrying or relevant. That\u2019s shortsighted. If Obama and future US presidents get China wrong, the resulting damage could be global, threatening the security and prosperity of all. Obama is already badly off-track. His grand plan to promote interdependent economic self-interest across the Pacific Rim while excluding China \u2013 the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP (similar to the controversial US-Europe Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP) \u2013 is in deep trouble. Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, declared last week that the TTP was a crucial \u201cpillar\u201d of future US influence. \u201cSuccess or failure will sway the direction of the global free trade system and [shape] the strategic environment in the Asia-Pacific,\u201d Abe said. His warning reflected alarm in Tokyo that a risk-averse Obama is again proving an unreliable partner and will fail to get the deal ratified by Congress. It has already been disowned by both his most likely successors, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.     An image from United States Navy video purportedly shows Chinese dredging vessels in the waters around Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands. Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters    Washington\u2019s painfully obvious inability to curb China\u2019s controversial island-building programme straddling the international shipping lanes of the South China Sea is seen as further evidence that the pivot is failing. Each week seems to bring news of another Chinese airstrip or newly fortified reef. Ignoring neighbouring countries\u2019 rival claims, Chinese has effectively unilaterally annexed 80% of the sea\u2019s area, through which passes $5tn of world trade annually. \u201cFreedom of navigation\u201d patrols by US warships, soon to be backed by Japan\u2019s navy, have had little discernible impact while increasing the risk of direct military confrontation. China has flatly rejected a precedent-setting UN court ruling that deemed its claim to own the Spratly Islands, also claimed by the Philippines, to be illegal. Beijing has taken a similarly intransigent stance in its dispute with Japan over the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands in the East China Sea. Some observers detect ulterior motives. China\u2019s military construction on the Spratlys and \u201cits effort to exhaust and eventually displace Japan in a contest for the Senkakus can be seen as an attempt psychologically and physically to isolate Taiwan and to prepare the battle space for China\u2019s possible use of military force to unify the PRC and Taiwan\u201d, an analysis by the International Institute for Strategic Studies said. Perceived American weakness has led some allies to take matters into their own hands. It emerged last week that Taiwan\u2019s military is also engaged in island fortification, at Itu Aba, its sole possession in the South China Sea. More dramatically still, the maverick Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, switched sides last week, announcing Manila would cease maritime co-operation with the US. China, he said, was the stronger partner. Duterte\u2019s shift reflects his anger at American criticism of human rights abuses rather than a deep strategic rethink. But it will certainly hearten Beijing.    This feeble anxiety to play down differences, and evident lack of confidence in US leadership, plays into China\u2019s hands    Other regional players are more cautious, an attitude encouraged by Beijing\u2019s divide-and-rule tactics. Vietnam\u2019s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, meekly agreed in talks with Xi this month that \u201cmaritime co-operation through friendly negotiations\u201d was the best way forward. But like China, Hanoi is rapidly building military capacity and cementing alliances with India, among others, in anticipation of less amicable times ahead. Similar diplomatic hedging of bets was on display in Laos this month, when an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit deliberately avoided mention of the UN court ruling. This feeble anxiety to play down differences \u2013 and evident lack of confidence in US leadership \u2013 plays into China\u2019s hands. The China dilemma extends far beyond the South China Sea. Having made nuclear disarmament a top priority in 2009, Obama has failed dismally to halt North Korea\u2019s accelerating pursuit of nuclear weapons. The threat was underscored by Pyongyang\u2019s biggest ever test explosion earlier this month. China, the only country with real leverage, has helped impose additional UN sanctions on North Korea. But it has consistently balked at taking game-changing measures, such as cutting off fuel oil supplies, which could force Kim Jong-un to think again. Beijing also says it will block \u201cunilateral\u201d measures by other countries. Obama\u2019s impotence has intensified questions in Japan and elsewhere about the credibility of the American security umbrella, encouraging nationalists who argue that Tokyo should re-arm in earnest \u2013 or even deploy its own nuclear weapons. But their main concern is not North Korea \u2013 it is China. Xi is not looking for a fight. His first-choice agent of change is money, not munitions. According to Xi\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d plan, his preferred path to 21st-century Chinese hegemony is through expanded trade, business and economic partnerships extending from Asia to the Middle East and Africa. China\u2019s massive Silk Road investments in central and west Asian oil and gas pipelines, high-speed rail and ports, backed by new institutions such as the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, are part of this strategy, which simultaneously encourages political and economic dependencies. Deng Xiaoping once said to get rich is glorious. Xi might add it is also empowering. Western neoliberals are optimistic. They typically argue that market-based economic exchanges can produce a win-win situation for rival states. In this way, China\u2019s rise may be peacefully accommodated, they say. Xi must also calculate that time is on China\u2019s side. \u201cChina\u2019s economic development and military modernisation programmes have witnessed dramatic progress since the early-1980s,\u201d said Karl Eikenberry in the American Interest. \u201cChina\u2019s aggregate GDP in 1980 was the seventh largest in the world\u2026 By 2014, China\u2019s GDP had multiplied 30 times to more than $9tn and is now the second largest in the world\u2026 The PRC\u2019s military spending, less than $10bn in 1990, grew to more than $129.4bn in 2014, second only to that of the US.\u201d On current trends, China\u2019s 2035 GDP could be a third larger than the US, Eikenberry said.     People watch a TV news showing an image that North Korea\u2019s Rodong Sinmun newspaper reports of the ground test of a high-powered engine of a carrier rocket at the country\u2019s Sohae Space Centre in Seoul, South Korea. Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/AP    Yet for less sanguine analysts, this prospective disparity, this growing lack of balance, plus the expanding number of potential flashpoints in the South China Sea, Taiwan and elsewhere, point only one way \u2013 towards future military conflict between the US and China. The Pentagon now officially refers to the Chinese \u201cthreat\u201d. This is the so-called \u201cThucydides Trap\u201d, a reference to the Athenian historian\u2019s account of the seemingly inevitable conflict between the rising city-state of Athens and the status quo power Sparta in the fifth century BC. Nowadays, the US is the status quo power and China the bumptious usurper. Open conflict is not inescapable, but it is under active discussion. A recent study by the Rand Corporation made a detailed examination of who might \u201cwin\u201d such a military showdown. It concludes that it would probably be catastrophic for both sides. Yet the study also suggests that, if war cannot be avoided, the US might be best advised to strike first, before China gets any stronger and the current US military advantage declines further. The dilemma is clear: amid rising nationalism in both countries, China is not willing to have its ambitions curbed or contained and the US is not ready to accept the world number two spot. These two juggernauts are on a collision course. It\u2019s unclear who or what can prevent a pile-up. The other players in the conflict between Beijing and Washington JAPAN Faced by what it perceives to be a growing threat from China, Japan\u2019s government, led by its conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has sought greater freedom to project military force beyond the country\u2019s borders. This is controversial, since it involves the \u201creinterpretation\u201d of Japan\u2019s postwar pacifist constitution. Concrete steps include joint naval patrols with the US in the South China Sea and direct help for coastal states such as the Philippines. VIETNAM  The communist one-party regime in Hanoi is an unlikely partner for the US, given still painful memories of the Vietnam war. But Vietnam has been wooed by Obama and George W Bush as part of Washington\u2019s attempts to control and channel China\u2019s regional ambitions. Vietnam has been involved in deadly fishing grounds clashes with China, with whom it fought a war in 1979. It has also sought help elsewhere. Earlier this month, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, offered a $500m credit line for defence co-operation. But Hanoi is also carefully hedging its bets by keeping diplomatic lines open to Beijing. INDONESIA The world\u2019s most populous Muslim country, Indonesia has vast human and natural resources and is seen as one of the new 21st-century economic players. Anxious to balance development needs and national pride, President Joko Widodo recently visited the Natuna Islands in the southern South China Sea, scene of repeated, minor fishing boat clashes with Chinese vessels. Widodo vowed to defend \u201csovereign territory\u201d against foreign encroachment. But, officially, Indonesia calls itself a \u201cnon-claimant\u201d country and says it is not formally in dispute with Beijing. This suits both countries, at least for now. By sidestepping their differences, they can get on with business. SOUTH KOREA  The Seoul government is more worried about its unpredictable northern neighbour than it is about China. Its defence minister said last week that South Korea has plans in place to assassinate Kim Jong-un and the North Korean leadership if the nuclear threat becomes critical. Seoul sticks close to the US, which maintains military bases in the country. But abiding South Korean distrust of Japan, Washington\u2019s other key east Asian ally, dating back to the Second World War, has undermined attempts to present a united front to Beijing \u2013 with which Seoul maintains friendly relations. INDIA Like China, India is rapidly expanding its military capabilities, spending an estimated $100bn on new defence systems since Narendra Modi became prime minister in 2014. Like China, its ambition is to project itself as a regional superpower looking both east and west. This potentially brings the two countries into conflict. They have long-standing border disputes in the Kashmir/Xinjiang and Arunachal Pradesh areas. In a forerunner to Obama\u2019s pivot to Asia, George W Bush\u2019s administration launched a strategic partnership with Delhi, partly as a counterbalance to China. For its part, Beijing maintains close ties with Pakistan, India\u2019s historical foe. RUSSIA  China and Russia are old enemies dating back to the cold war, but these days, they claim to be close friends. A visit to Beijing by President Vladimir Putin in June saw the launching of a number of trade and oil deals worth up to $50bn. China sees Russia as a valuable provider of raw materials but also as a political and military partner in relation to the US. In defiance of Washington, the two countries held large-scale war games in the South China Sea last week, practising taking over islands in disputed waters. Putin also values collaboration as a way of circumventing sanctions imposed by the US and EU after Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/yellowing-film-hong-kong-umbrella-movement-struggles-to-be-seen-cinema", "publicationDate": "2016-09-25T23:53:45Z", "tags": ["Hong Kong", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["The result is Yellowing, a 133-minute documentary which premiered earlier this year at the Hong Kong Independent Film Festival and has also been screened at festivals in Vancouver and Taiwan.", "Two years after the umbrella movement, Yellowing will appear at the Jihlava International Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic next month and has been submitted for the prestigious Taiwan Golden Horse film awards."], "title": "Screened out?

It was the night of 28 September 2014 and, as the umbrella movement protests erupted on the streets of Hong Kong, the young filmmaker decided it was his mission to make a visual record of the historic political convulsion.    Related: Hong Kong\u2019s umbrella revolution - the Guardian briefing    \u201cI believe that sometimes words cannot explain everything,\u201d the 29-year-old director says. \u201cImages are needed to convey what civil disobedience really means.\u201d Over the next 79 days, Chan returned repeatedly to the movement\u2019s two main camps. He followed ordinary protesters, including a teacher and a high school student, and captured frenzied clashes between police and demonstrators.  At one point, recorded in the documentary, the filmmaker himself was embroiled in the violence, when he was hit in the face by a police officer. The result is Yellowing, a 133-minute documentary which premiered earlier this year at the Hong Kong Independent Film Festival and has also been screened at festivals in Vancouver and Taiwan.          The trailer for Yellowing.    The film takes its name from the colour which came to symbolise Hong Kong\u2019s struggle for democracy. Its Chinese name is Memo of the Troubled Times.  Chan says his film is \u201can important record\u201d that gives an insider\u2019s view of a watershed moment in the former British colony\u2019s quest for universal suffrage.  The director claims some local media self-censored when covering the movement, failing to report from the perspective of ordinary demonstrators.  \u201cMainstream media mostly focused on the leadership of the movement and exaggerated violent scenes of protesters,\u201d Chan says. \u201cI think independent film producers have the responsibility to document what mainstream media failed to report on.\u201d     Chan says of the film: \u2018I think independent film producers have the responsibility to document what mainstream media failed to report on.\u2019 Photograph: Chan Tsz Woon    But on the eve of the protests\u2019 second anniversary, Chan claims all of Hong Kong\u2019s major cinemas are refusing to show his film, the result, he suspects, of creeping self-censorship as businesses shy away from offending Beijing.  At first Chan says he wondered whether the film had been rejected because it \u201clacked quality or was it because of its political nature?\u201d \u201cBut after it did well in many film festivals, I think it proved that the film itself is OK.\u201d Vincent Chui, the artistic director of an independent film organisation that is distributing Yellowing, claims the documentary\u2019s positive reviews would normally have guaranteed it a theatrical release.  But Chui says locals cinemas had repeatedly rebuffed his approaches, without explaining why. \u201cNobody would tell you the exact reason.\u201d The producer also suspects Hong Kong\u2019s big-screens are shunning the film because of its political nature but admitted: \u201cThere is no way for us to know whether [the cinemas] practiced self-censorship or received direct orders.\u201d Chan says one explanation for his film\u2019s predicament could be the success of Ten Years, a dystopian feature film which envisaged a bleak future for Hong Kong under greater Chinese control.   Related: Ten Years \u2013 the terrifying vision of Hong Kong that Beijing wants obscured    In April, Ten Years incurred the wrath of China\u2019s Communist party controlled media after it won the best film prize at the prestigious Hong Kong Film Awards. Chinese state mouthpiece Global Times blasted the film as a \u201cvirus of the mind\u201d. Soon after, it began disappearing from Hong Kong screens. \u201cIt might have become harder [for other politically sensitive films] because the film was so successful that it brought about criticisms from the Chinese state media. As a result, cinemas tend to be more conservative towards this kind of film,\u201d Chan says.  Taking their lead from the makers of Ten Years, Yellowing\u2019s producers are fighting back against the marginalisation of their film by staging \u201cguerrilla screenings\u201d in smaller venues such as school lecture halls and a local museum. But Chui said a large-scale cinema release remained their ultimate goal. \u201cI don\u2019t want [self-censorship] to become a norm like it is in mainland China. It is not a good phenomenon that viewers have started distinguishing independent movies from the so-called commercial films.\u201d     The umbrella movement protests erupted on the streets of Hong Kong in September 2014.

Two years after the umbrella movement, Yellowing will appear at the Jihlava International Documentary Film Festival in the Czech Republic next month and has been submitted for the prestigious Taiwan Golden Horse film awards. Chan says he hopes his work will serve as a monument to the city\u2019s political struggle. \u201cHong Kong has changed a lot [since the protests]. Some viewers might have participated in the movement wholeheartedly, but they have not revisited those memories because of the negative emotions related to the movement\u2019s failure,\u201d he says. \u201cMy film might provide them with an opportunity to look back at what happened during the protests so that they can tidy up their thoughts and emotions.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/26/with-robots-is-a-life-without-work-one-wed-want-to-live", "publicationDate": "2016-09-26T07:21:21Z", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Consciousness", "Psychology", "Computing", "Business in Australia", "Australia news", "Artificial intelligence (AI)", "Work & careers", "Technology", "Ethics", "Philosophy", "Money"], "sentences": ["People view a robot during the Taiwan Automation Intelligence and Robot Show in Taipei, Taiwan, in August."], "title": "With robots, is a life without work one we'd want to live?", "article": "When Aristotle described \u201cthe complete happiness of man\u201d, he thought it would include, among other things, \u201cself-sufficiency, leisureliness and unweariedness\u201d. Unfortunately the philosopher concluded that \u201csuch a life would be too high for man\u201d \u2013 it was suitable only for the gods. All the same, he encouraged humanity to keep striving to get as close to \u201ccomplete happiness\u201d as possible. I reckon he\u2019d be proud of where we\u2019ve got. Today, the fourth industrial revolution \u2013 which ranges from artificial intelligence to genetic engineering and automation \u2013 promises almost total freedom from weariness and uninterrupted leisure time as demands of work are taken away from us by better, cheaper and more efficient artificial technology.  The robots are coming and apparently they\u2019re here to work. But will all the free time we\u2019re being promised actually make our lives any better? Is a life without work one we\u2019d actually want to live?  I\u2019ve often debated the merits of continuing to work after winning the lotto with friends and family \u2013 I maintain that I wouldn\u2019t but I always find myself in the minority. Apparently this isn\u2019t unique to my social circle \u2013 a 2013 Gallup poll found 68% of people would keep working after winning lotto. I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re not thinking they\u2019ll still need the money, so what is it about the daily grind that\u2019s more appealing than putting your feet up on a beach?     People view a robot during the Taiwan Automation Intelligence and Robot Show in Taipei, Taiwan, in August. Photograph: Ritchie B. Tongo/EPA    The obvious answer is that we don\u2019t only work for income, we do it because it adds meaning to our lives and gives a sense of purpose. Even though I insist I wouldn\u2019t work if I struck it rich, what I mean is that I\u2019d choose the type of work I would do and how often I\u2019d do it. For instance, I would still write and give talks on subjects I\u2019m passionate about.  It\u2019s not necessarily because \u201cif you do what you love, you\u2019ll never work a day in your life\u201d. Writing, preparing talks and doing research are all work but it\u2019s work I think is worth doing and the financial wealth would mean I could balance it with everything else I value in life. To put it simply, I\u2019d do it because it would bring me closer to Aristotle\u2019s \u201ccomplete happiness\u201d. There\u2019s new research to back up this popular mode of thinking. The economist Paul Dolan\u2019s recent book Happiness by Design shows the happiest people are those who experience feelings of both purpose and pleasure over time. All work and no play might make Jack a dull boy but all play and no work isn\u2019t going to make him happy either.   Related: The Guardian view on artificial intelligence: look out, it\u2019s ahead of you | Editorial    Of course not all work is going to provide us with a profound sense of purpose. Some of it is both pointless and unpleasant \u2013 a total happiness suck. Someone in a role they hate, working for a company whose values don\u2019t match their own or not earning enough money to live off isn\u2019t going to be nourished by their work. Assuming their financial needs could be met, they\u2019d seem to be much better off quitting and leaving the work to a robot.  Here\u2019s where the challenges for automation start to arise. It\u2019s easy to say there are certain individuals who would be happier if they left their jobs to a robot but automation isn\u2019t going to replace individual roles \u2013 it\u2019s going to replace entire industries. Experts say 47% of jobs in America are likely to be replaced by robots and other automated processes and researchers reckon the situation is likely to be similar in Australia.  There are almost undoubtedly people who find purpose or pleasure in the work they do and will not be happier having their jobs replaced. But automation looks likely to capture the satisfied and dissatisfied alike across a range of industries \u2013 cabbies, surgeons, accountants, artists \u2013 the list goes on.    Arendt predicted that the rise of automation would mean humanity would be &apos;liberated from its oldest burden&apos;       It\u2019s worth noting automation isn\u2019t just about making businesses more efficient or profitable. In some cases, it might also be the right thing to do for society. If robots prove more capable surgeons or artificial accountants are less willing to facilitate tax evasion than the occasional dodgy human version, there would be a solid ethical argument for making humans redundant from those professions.  This is great news for those who hate their jobs \u2013 not only are they freed of meaningless work and therefore happier, they\u2019re doing the right thing. But what about those who like their jobs? Would the ethical argument appear anything more than rationalisation for their newly found unhappiness?  That depends on whether losing a job you loved due to automation would actually have a negative impact on your happiness. If automation meant you were able to use the time you\u2019d previously spent working doing things that felt more pleasurable or meaningful, you might still be better off. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 46% of employed people (about 5.3m) work 35 to 44 hours a week. Each hour spent at work \u2013 however meaningful \u2013 is an hour that can\u2019t be spent on some other potentially fun or purposeful activity. I find my job both pleasurable and purposeful but, were it to be stolen by a robot and I were able to spend more time with my wife and son, I\u2019d probably experience a happiness bump for the simple reason that not all activities are equally pleasurable or meaningful. Unless work was the single most important thing in your life, there\u2019s still the chance a robot taking your job would make you happier. This means a robot workforce might actually provide people with more meaningful lives even while simultaneously taking them away from meaningful work. Plus it will provide those whose jobs are making them unhappy with the opportunity to do something different.  This paints a compelling picture: CS Lewis once described friendship, philosophy and art as being meaningful precisely because they were unnecessary and had no survival value. They were, instead, \u201cthings which give value to survival\u201d. If the fourth industrial revolution is able to help people focus on those things that give our lives value, robotic workers almost present as a moral imperative.

Photograph: Laura Lezza/Getty Images    Of course there are enormous logistical questions as to whether those who are going to be displaced by robots will actually be provided with the means necessary to pursue other meaningful ways of living. We simply don\u2019t know yet whether the taxi driver who enjoyed the chance to have conversations with different people every day will have other opportunities to find a sense of sociability or whether he\u2019ll be forced into less meaningful work.  More significantly, we don\u2019t know if people will be able to see their lives as meaningful without work. Even if automation provides people with the opportunity to find purpose elsewhere, it\u2019s not clear whether we\u2019ll be ready or able to conceive of a life of meaning which is totally disconnected from work.  This concern was raised by Hannah Arendt in her influential work The Human Condition. Decades ago, Arendt predicted that the rise of automation would mean humanity would be \u201cliberated from its oldest and most natural burden, the burden of labouring\u201d. For her, this wasn\u2019t something to celebrate. She feared that a variety of economic forces had effectively changed the way people saw themselves so that it was their labour that defined them.  Given the central role work plays in psychological wellbeing \u2013 unemployed people report feeling less satisfied with their lives than those who have jobs \u2013 it seems Arendt might have been on to something. Think about the last time you introduced yourself to somebody \u2013 how long was it before you told them what you do for work? Was it the first thing you told them after your name? When you met someone, how long was it before you asked \u201cwhat do you do?\u201d Maybe our jobs do define us more than we give credit. Given the strong connection people make between their work, identity and sense of meaning, Arendt was concerned about the implications of automation on their lives. She believed \u201cnothing could be worse\u201d than being told meaning could only be found in a certain thing \u2013 like work \u2013 and then having that source of meaning taken away.    Related: The future of work: 'Computers are good at the jobs we find hard, and bad at the jobs we find easy'    Arendt\u2019s point is that the benefits of automation are only going to be enjoyed if they are recognised \u2013 that is, if workers are able to see themselves as having meaning outside of their job. The father who defined himself primarily as a lawyer might not be able to find the same sense of purpose or meaning from a life of domesticity. Even though he could theoretically find meaning in his family, he would need to change his perspective first. For some, this change won\u2019t come easily. For others, it might be impossible.  Paul Dolan makes a similar argument. He suggests there\u2019s no such thing as an objectively pleasurable or meaningful activity; rather, each individual defines what purpose and pleasure mean for themselves. Which means if people have decided or been conditioned to believe the only thing that can provide meaning in their lives is work, then it doesn\u2019t matter how much opportunity we create for them to do other things \u2013 they\u2019re not going to see it as a viable replacement.  This won\u2019t apply to everyone. Although there are careerists and workaholics among us, many people do find joy, meaning and identity outside of their professional identity. However, automation poses threats to these people as well because robots aren\u2019t only likely to replace paying jobs; artificial intelligence will enable robots to replace us in a range of personal and domestic roles as well. Care for the elderly, parenting, volunteer work and other forms of support for the vulnerable may soon be dominated by robots. The philosopher Thomas Wells sees an automated care industry as a real possibility. As robots become more intelligent, they will be able to provide the illusion of care \u2013providing practical support, conversation, even intimacy.     The dignity and rights of workers needs to continue to be a centrepiece of our conversations about the future of work    In many ways, this is a good thing \u2013 like wheelchairs, hearing aids and other technologies, robots can provide those who are dependent on support with autonomy. If I have a robot to cook my meals, I\u2019m no longer forced to rely on my family to bring me food; if a robot can carry me in and out of the shower, I\u2019m freed from the indignity of being naked and vulnerable in front of a care worker. Robotic care might actually be a way to give some dignity to those in need of help. Wells makes the point that what these robots provide isn\u2019t care in the true sense of the word. They can provide support \u2013 both physical and psychological \u2013 but they\u2019ll never actually care. He\u2019s right but, even if robots were capable of genuine empathy, the crucial question remains: once we start outsourcing care and relationships to robots, what\u2019s left for us? And even if there is something left, will we want to do it? Maybe your grandmother might be more dignified and better supported by a robot than by members of her family who took turns coming over to help out. Maybe she\u2019d still receive a sense of love and community from more meaningful social calls when you\u2019re able to be genuinely present instead of busy with chores. But there\u2019s a risk you can\u2019t have one without the other. It\u2019s partly through the moments of help, care and support your relationship is sustained and deepened. Solidarity and love can only be fostered through genuine personal encounters, so if we outsource the caring to robots I\u2019m not sure there will be enough to sustain the relationship; enough to motivate us to stop by for a chat or call on her birthday.      A cow is milked by a milking robot at a farm in Vritz, near Nantes, western France. Photograph: Jean-Sebastien Evrard/AFP/Getty Images    The same is true for other aspects of our lives. If we leave the most difficult, boring or frustrating work to robots, this might change our ability and appetite for more stimulating or meaningful work. Humans are creatures of habit \u2013 the first time we do something it\u2019s difficult but it gets easier over time. A recent anti-smoking ad tells us that \u201cevery time you quit, you get a little bit better at it\u201d. The same is true for everything else in human behaviour: every time you work at something difficult you get a little more perseverant, every time you give yourself to someone else you get a little more charitable and so on. The question is whether automation will shoot itself in the foot by freeing up our time to do things that matter but at the same time deprive us of the skills we need to use our time meaningfully. Although fictional, the marshmallow caricatures in Pixar\u2019s WALL-E resonated with many viewers because they recognised the possibility of such laziness in themselves and in the technologies they use. They had all the time and resources they needed to live happy lives but, as robots took over the heavy lifting, people were robbed of opportunities to improve themselves and lacked the initiative to find new ones. Automation might not make us all lazy and apathetic \u2013 as I\u2019ve already said, there are other meaningful and purposeful activities that can fill the void of work. But the general shift away from human labour and toward a robotic equivalent might have consequences for those humans still engaged in work. While we\u2019re all workers, it\u2019s easy to remember the importance of work to be dignified, safe and fairly compensated \u2013 our shared experience of work creates a solidarity between one another.    Related: If robots are the future of work, where do humans fit in? | Zoe Williams    Once work is performed by robots \u2013 to whom we don\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t) assign the same moral rights as we do humans \u2013 the associations we have between work and dignity are less easily recognised. Our bond of solidarity to fellow workers is broken. For this reason and many others \u2013 like the rise of the gig economy \u2013 the dignity and rights of workers needs to continue to be a centrepiece of our conversations about the future of work. While, for many, work might become redundant, its value and the virtues it can cultivate are evergreen.  Soon enough, the majority of an entire generation won\u2019t know what it means to have a job but they will need to know how to work. Work isn\u2019t exclusive to the labour market \u2013 relationships, parenting, creativity, sport and exercise are all kinds of work. But if robots are taking care of household chores in a decade, I\u2019ll need some other way to teach my son that there\u2019s more to life than pleasure, that sometimes you need to stick at something to get results and that in a community, everyone has a role to play so everyone can flourish. For my parents, chores and household jobs were a way of teaching me that message.  None of this is reason to fear the coming of robots or to put a moratorium on their development. In fact, given the advantages they might bring to humanity, it might be unethical to stop. However, if the huge leaps we\u2019ve seen in technology over the past decades has taught us anything, it\u2019s that by the time new technology has arrived, it\u2019s too late to start thinking about the social and moral consequences. Those conversations have to begin now.  How we approach automation, the lines we draw and the principles we use to govern our decision-making need to be shaped by a clear sense of purpose \u2013 the same is true for the entire fourth industrial revolution. If all we seek is a state of decreased labour, increased innovation or more progressive ways of living, all we have to do is wait. But there\u2019s no guarantee we\u2019ll like what we get.

The crime he committed was a frenzied, mass stabbing of travellers on a metro train, inflicted with a long fruit knife, which left four commuters dead and 24 injured in 2014.

You expect an outpouring of outrage but within a short time a new norm emerges. \u201cIf you said 20 years ago that the public would accept gay marriage, you would have got a very different answer. Rarely has the death penalty been abolished by vote, but it has been restricted by legal measures, then abolished; and that\u2019s been accepted.\u201d Europe, he points out, is now a \u201cdeath penalty-free zone\u201d with the sole exception of Belarus.

Keir Starmer. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    Despite alarm over the recent rate of hangings and beheadings in Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan, the international trend is for countries to abandon executions. There are 109 abolitionist states, although seven retain the punishment for war crimes and treason. A further 39 states abstain in practice. Taiwan has 42 people on death row. Alongside the US and South Korea, it is one of only a few liberal democracies that supports judicially authorised killing of its citizens. When the present governing party was last in power, it introduced a temporary moratorium and drafted into domestic legislation the United Nation\u2019s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which prevents the death sentence being imposed on pregnant women or those who committed their crimes below the age of 18. That moratorium, however, was lifted when the government changed in 2010, leading to the execution of 33 people. The electoral victory this year of Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan\u2019s first female president, has boosted hopes of converting the country permanently to abolition.    Rarely has the death penalty been abolished by vote, but it has been restricted by legal measures, then abolished  Keir Starmer     The Democratic Progressive party emerged out of activist opposition to an earlier era of one-party rule. Human rights are part of its core values. The president, who is a lawyer by profession, has so far not committed herself either way. Lehrfreund says: \u201cWe are not there to dictate, we are there to assist them.\u201d He has been working closely with the Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty. \u201cWe hope Taiwan will show it is respectful of human rights and wants to be different to other countries in the region. That would create momentum for others to switch, perhaps Thailand and South Korea.\u201d Lehrfreund is convinced that popular support for executions is not set in stone. \u201cOnce you throw in variables about innocent defendants being mistakenly executed, then perceptions change.\u201d Challenging \u201cmisconceived views about the deterrent effect\u201d of the death penalty also helps shift opinion, he adds. The experience of awaiting execution can be mentally destabilising, says Latham. \u201cIt\u2019s termed \u2018death row syndrome\u2019. It has an incredibly negative impact. It resembles a depressive state. Depending on conditions and if you are kept in isolation, prisoners develop more severe responses such as hearing voices and delusional beliefs.\u201d As well as oscillating wildly between hope and fear, inmates overhear neighbours in adjoining cells being dragged away and never coming back. Latham will be talking to doctors about diagnosing prisoners and the way evidence is handled by the courts. \u201cPeople can appear superficially to be well but they may nonetheless be mentally disordered.\u201d     Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is among world leaders considering reintroducing the death penalty.

And that\u2019s welcome.\u201d There will also be discussions about Taiwan\u2019s plans to introduce a jury system. Progress towards global abolition may not be straightforward, Lehrfreund concedes. Both Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte and Turkey president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan threatened this summer to restore the death penalty, setbacks that may overshadow International World Day Against the Death Penalty on 10 October. \u201cThere should be a burden on any state to make sure they are not executing people who are mentally disordered,\u201d Lehrfreund says. \u201cIt\u2019s in the political arena that abolition will eventually happen.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/hong-kong-activist-joshua-wong-detained-thailand-china-deportation", "publicationDate": "2016-10-05T01:24:36Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Hong Kong", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "sentences": ["\u201cActually Joshua Wong was just in Taipei, Taiwan, and he was able to travel there and stayed there for two-to-three days,\u201d he told the Khaosod news website."], "title": "Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong detained in Thailand 'at China's request' \u2013 reports", "article": "Joshua Wong, the student activist who became a global symbol of the fight for democracy in Hong Kong, has reportedly been detained in Thailand following a request from China and will shortly be flown back to Hong Kong.

Prominent members of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement accused Beijing of being behind Wong\u2019s deportation.  Agnes Chow, the deputy secretary general of Demosist\u014d, said: \u201cWe believe that the Chinese government is using all ways to stop us spreading democratic ideas from Hong Kong to other countries. But bigger suppression makes a stronger fight.  \u201cWe just hope that Joshua is safe,\u201d the 19-year-old activist added. \u201cWe will not give up the fight for democracy and the fight against the Chinese government which disrespects human rights.\u201d  Nathan Law, Demosist\u014d\u2019s president, told Hong Kong radio he believed there was \u201csome connection\u201d between Wong\u2019s detention and Beijing.

Wong, 19, was due to address students at Chulalongkorn University at an event to mark the 40th anniversary of a massacre of pro-democracy students by security forces and royalist militias in 1976. The Thammasat massacre of 6 October 6 1976, remains a deeply sensitive issue in Thailand\u2019s turbulent recent history, and was the prelude to a military coup. He was expected to talk about his experiences during the 79-day umbrella movement protests in Hong Kong in 2014. Jason Ng, a Hong Kong-based writer who knows Wong, said that before leaving Hong Kong the student activist had voiced concerns that he might not be allowed to enter Thailand.  The suspected abduction of Hong Kong bookseller Gui Minhai last year by Chinese agents had also left Wong nervous about potential risks to his well-being.    Related: Gui Minhai: the strange disappearance of a publisher who riled China's elite    \u201cHe was\u2026 most concerned about his personal safety, being abducted or attacked. Being turned back is one thing, getting hurt or disappearing is another,\u201d said Ng, the author of a book on Hong Kong\u2019s umbrella movement protests. To guard against such threats, ahead of Wong\u2019s trip to Thailand supporters set up an encrypted group on the messaging service WhatsApp through which the activist could notify Bangkok-based academics and journalists of any problems.  Wong\u2019s detention appeared to be the latest example of the closer ties between Thailand\u2019s military regime and China\u2019s Communist rulers, who consider the student activist a subversive. Since the 2014 coup in Thailand, a series of incidents have underlined Beijing\u2019s influence in the south-east Asian country. In October last year a Hong Kong publisher who specialised in salacious books about the Communist party elite vanished from his seafront apartment in the Thai resort town Pattaya, only to reappear in custody in mainland China where he is now being held. At around the same time, a Chinese journalist and campaigner called Li Xin fled China, hoping to claim political asylum in Thailand. However, he disappeared while traveling from Thailand to Laos. \u201cI warned him to be very careful in Thailand. It is very dangerous here,\u201d one Chinese exile living in Bangkok said at the time. A number of other Chinese dissidents and members of the Uighur ethnic minority from western China have also been deported back to China at the request of its government. Netiwit, who said he waited at the airport until 3am after Wong\u2019s Emirates Airline flight landed at 11:45pm, said his treatment amounted to \u201ccensorship\u201d. \u201cActually Joshua Wong was just in Taipei, Taiwan, and he was able to travel there and stayed there for two-to-three days,\u201d he told the Khaosod news website.  \u201cThailand should stay out of the Chinese sphere of power, but we\u2019re not able to do this.\u201d Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cThailand\u2019s arrest of Joshua Wong, a well-known pro-democracy activist in Hong Kong, sadly suggests that Bangkok is willing to do Beijing\u2019s bidding. Wong should be freed immediately and allowed to travel and exercise his right to free expression.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/oct/05/hurricane-matthew-south-east-us-carolinas-florida-haiti-colorado-fire-taiwan-china-australia", "publicationDate": "2016-10-05T20:30:43Z", "tags": ["Haiti", "Hurricanes", "Haiti", "Drought", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "United States", "China", "Taiwan", "Australia", "World news", "Hurricane Matthew"], "sentences": ["Meanwhile, Typhoon Megi continued to cause havoc across Taiwan and south-east China as it made landfall late last week."], "title": "Hurricane Matthew closes in on south-east US after Haiti target", "article": "Hurricane Matthew, which smashed into Haiti with winds hitting 145mph, leaving a trail of devastation and at least 10,000 people in shelters, was on Wednesday reported to be travelling north-west and in the next two days or so about to threaten Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, probably as a very powerful category 3 hurricane.

First released in August, the phone initially received rave reviews for the extent to which it pushed the envelope on what a phablet-sized smartphone could do. It shipped with wireless charging, a battery that lasted well over a day and charged to 70% in less than an hour, and a USB-C connector \u2013 Samsung\u2019s first phone to use the next-generation port. Then it started exploding. Sporadic reports came in over early September suggesting that the phone\u2019s battery became unstable when fully charged, and could overheat and explode. Samsung issued a global replacement programme, but steered clear of using the language of a \u201crecall\u201d \u2013 until the US consumer product safety commission stepped in and told it that it couldn\u2019t bypass procedure. Once the recall was announced, Samsung also issued a software update to earlier versions, capping the charge at 60% and displaying a warning as the devices were powered on. For the most part, the problems were limited to North America and South Korea, the two markets where the majority of the devices had been sold, and it looked like Samsung could begin to fix the problem. Then, in early October, replacement Note 7s began to explode or catch fire as well. As of 10 October, eight have hit the press: five in the US, including one on a flight; one in Taiwan; and two in South Korea. Overnight, Samsung announced that it was \u201ctemporarily adjusting the Galaxy Note 7 production schedule\u201d. The announcement apparently buried the news twice over: not only was it released immediately after the US presidential debate, it appears that the \u201cadjustment\u201d is down to zero. Korean news agency Yonhap reported that production was stopped entirely. The issue appears endemic to the Note 7, and could be a direct result of the same envelope-pushing that earned the phone praise at its launch. According to Bloomberg, Samsung expressly tried to rush a number of new features into the Note 7 all at once. The company had taken heed of rumours, proven correct, that the iPhone 7, released in September, would be an incremental update to the the earlier iPhone 6s, and wanted to capitalise on the \u201cboring\u201d release by dropping an exciting phone of its own a few days before. The Note 7 was certainly exciting. If Samsung is lucky, the damage to the brand will be limited to one phone. But there\u2019s a risk, as is so often the case, that the perception of a cover-up may prove to be worse than the issue. That perception began almost the same time reports of exploding phones began trickling. Samsung\u2019s decision to bypass official recall procedures was odd, and it took days for the company to work with the authorities and issue a strongly worded statement \u201casking users to power down their Galaxy Note 7s and exchange them now\u201d. When the replacement phones began exploding, it again took the company almost a week to take action. Worse, some customers reported what looked like attempts to keep them quiet. A Kentucky man whose phone caught fire on 4 October told his local news station that he\u2019d felt like Samsung were helping him, until he received what he said was a misdirected text from a Samsung rep: \u201cJust now got this. I can try and slow him down if we think it will matter, or we just let him do what he keeps threatening to do and see if he does it.\u201d The company was so slow taking action that many US carriers decided to act unilaterally. Both AT&amp;T and T-Mobile stopped selling the phone, based on the reports. Worst of all, the crisis is threatening to engulf other areas of the Korean giant\u2019s business. A lawsuit in the US alleges that washing machines sold in the US are also dodgy, prompting a CPSC intervention to \u201caddress safety issues\u201d. Worse, the suit claims another cover-up: that Samsung \u201cmoved aggressively to collect and destroy all evidence of the defective machines\u201d after they exploded. It may be unfair, but Samsung is no longer fighting to defend the Note 7. The company says it \u201cunderstands the concern our carriers and consumers must be feeling after recent reports have raised questions about our newly released replacement Note7 devices\u201d. \u201cWe want to reassure our customers that we take every report seriously and we appreciate their patience as we work diligently through this process.\u201d  Its task now is to prevent the perception spreading that it\u2019s a company that cares more for PR wins than customer safety."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/11/music-you-missed-from-rebel-yell-to-jordan-irelands-mysterious-solo-album", "publicationDate": "2016-10-11T07:03:13Z", "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Electronic music", "Australia news", "Experimental music", "Pop and rock"], "sentences": ["A drone piece evokes a cold mountain morning in Taiwan before an earthquake."], "title": "Music you missed: from Rebel Yell to Jordan Ireland's mysterious solo album", "article": "Are Australian solo artists making the best music in 2016? With seven solo musicians and one duo listed here, I could certainly argue the case. That said, solo artists have always dominated my music collection; they are less swayed by prevailing trends and their music ages better. Over the past year it\u2019s become clear that women are making the most interesting and idiosyncratic club music. Holy Balm and Elisabeth Dixon have great new albums, Chiara Kickdrum is featured on the Domestic Documents series of local \u201celectronic abstraction\u201d, and the live sets I\u2019ve seen recently from LA Suffocated, WDK, Lucy Clich\u00e9 and Workshop have been truly excellent too. Three caveats for the following list: Lawrence Arabia is a New Zealander. I\u2019m not 100% sure when Jordan Ireland\u2019s record came out because he sent me the files but didn\u2019t answer further questions. And while I usually stick to LPs, the triple album from Pale Earth listed here is balanced out by an EP from Rebel Yell.  As always, please pay for the albums you enjoy and tell me what I missed in less-visible Australian gems released in July, August and September. Nullarbor 1988-1989 by Friendships            Where to begin with young Melbourne duo Misha Grace and Nic Brown? This debut is strange, brave and wildly exciting. Friendships dive deep into jungle, grime and dubstep, yet amid the fury of beats, breaks and fastidious production they find space to inject great helpings of heart, art, beauty and risk. And when the bass hits, it hits hard.      Australian band Friendships (Misha Grace and Nic Brown) dive into jungle, grime and dubstep    The record overflows with ideas. Grace did a series of (very good) paintings to accompany it while Brown delivers a conceptual narrative in gauche spoken-word sequences that seem to be set in a Wake In Fright-style outback dystopia. \u201cRecognise something in me, love, that resonates with you/Light it on fire and piss on it\u201d he croaks on Footscray 1989 to the tinkle of saloon piano. The contrast between Brown\u2019s junkie-ramble poetry and the amphetamine-charged club tracks makes this record too odd-shaped to pigeonhole. I\u2019ve never heard anything like it.  I Had Myself A Nuclear Spring by Kate Carr            Last year Brisbane expat and field recordist Kate Carr spent a month in Marnay-sur-Seine: a small town in France next to a nuclear power plant which turned into a temporary wetland after the river flooded. She roamed \u201cmuddy marshes filled with buzzing electrical towers, corroded machinery, shrieking birds and canals feeding a nuclear complex\u201d using recording gear compromised by the area\u2019s electromagnetism, creating the electrical hum that is this album\u2019s sinister thread. If you\u2019ve ever doubted the capacity of sound art to elucidate chewy ideas, and not merely mood or some boffin\u2019s confusing PhD thesis, Carr\u2019s work will convince you otherwise. These pieces are full of space yet dense with a particularly modern dread. At times, to draw us closer, she plays a few reverberant guitar notes. Otherwise, it\u2019s chirruping wildfowl, water, bass of indeterminate origin and always, the anxiety-inducing purr, buzz and whine of electricity. It is the soundtrack of psychosis for Chuck in Better Call Saul and a metaphor for the low-humming knowing that there\u2019s no escape, not even in nature.  Mother Of Millions by Rebel Yell            The industrial techno of Brisbane\u2019s Rebel Yell (Grace Stevenson) is anything but bleak. Run through a metal guitar pedal, Stevenson\u2019s vocals are like the commands of a berserk boot camp instructor set in the bloopers reel of Blade Runner.     Rebel Yell: anything but bleak    Stevenson says a gig she saw with Australian electronic music-makers Lucy Clich\u00e9, Video Ezy and Sarah Spencer (Blank Realm) opened her eyes to industrial music, as well as a burnt CD she got from an op shop called \u201cdark tech\u201d. Mother of Millions is her first EP and already her sound is impressively distinct: noxious, militaristic and properly industrial. Disobey at your peril. One Of Us by Cash Savage and the Last Drinks            If alt-country with banjo and fiddle has always seemed a bit fruity for your palate, Cash Savage and the Last Drinks may convert you to its nourishment. Savage sings like salvation depends on it \u2013 though not hers. \u201cFor you, for us, for everyone,\u201d she belts out on Run With The Dogs, lassoing us all in on the ride.  The Melbourne band\u2019s third record is split between rousing, jam-band rock songs and tear-jerking, bushwhacking ballads. The former crest in choruses built for cathartic sing-a-longs with soaring, golden-toned guitar breaks, The War On Drugs\u2019 highway song momentum and Patti Smith\u2019s vocal intensity. Elsewhere, ballads like Song For A Funeral \u2013 about swallowing the bitter pill that is a loved one\u2019s suicide \u2013 function as forgiveness shared. Country rock can sound flat or twee on record so kudos to producer Nick Finch for making One Of Us so vital. Deliverance by Witch Hats            Something\u2019s changed, I thought, on hearing the third record from Melbourne band Witch Hats. Frozen in time since their 2009 debut Cellulite Soul (2011\u2019s Pleasure Syndrome passed me by), their music was still personified as the combative neighbourhood punk with a point to prove. Deliverance, I realised, was Witch Hats gone dad-bod: paunchier but far better at knowing which buttons to push. Still got the swing, still got the swagger. Kris Buscombe\u2019s voice embodies the disconsolate sneer of late-70s UK punk, especially with uppercuts such as \u201cFuck your mother, fuck your father too/They\u2019ve both got tickets on you\u201d on Weekend Holocauster. The ska influence is stronger now and the spectres of several of post punk bands float by \u2013 The Stranglers, Magazine \u2013 but Witch Hats\u2019 guitars have more meat on their bones. Ludicrous that the 3:37-minute title track has only been played once on Triple J. Just as one chorus ends, another one hits.  Jordan Ireland with Purple Orchestra by Jordan Ireland Jordan Ireland, previously singer and guitarist in Townsville \u201cbuzz band\u201d the Middle East, told FasterLouder in May: \u201cAll the hype and excitement surrounding our little knot of young and very naive country kids became really daunting, really quickly.\u201d The Middle East broke up at Splendour in the Grass in 2011, the year of their first album. Ireland\u2019s solo album is more akin to dappled shade than sound. Strings, strumming, barely perceptible percussion, piano and flute are muted and textural, with Ireland\u2019s voice murmuring melodies from the deep, languishing in the possibilities of the irresolute. The pastoral psychedelica of early Pink Floyd or the gently soaring vocals of Kishi Bashi are fair comparisons, though Ireland\u2019s songs are hazier and more diaphanous. The record was produced by Greg Walker (Machine Translations), whose intuitive touch explains how closely its sound supports Ireland\u2019s claim that \u201cthe birds, the air and the [purple] mood\u201d were all active members of the orchestra. There are no videos, press materials and no Bandcamp site. Journalists will laud it as lush baroque pop \u2013 if they ever hear it. Always by Pale Earth            When Pale Earth\u2019s Benjamin Thompson came to Room40 with a two-hour triple album of 33 electronic tracks, he thought label head Lawrence English would suggest he trim it to one very good album instead. He didn\u2019t, and Always was released in its entirety. To listeners used to a drip-feed of singles heralding albums that barely clock 30 minutes, the scale of Always was a challenge to rise to. \u201cI\u2019ve been absolutely confused and excited by the people who tell me they\u2019re listening to it all,\u201d Thompson said.    Related: Music you missed: 10 Australian underground releases from Deep Heat to Dispossessed    The songs chronicle Thompson\u2019s travels through Asia, Japan and (his dreams of) Korea. From shimmering ambience a la Fennesz to wonky beats and experiments in texture, the only thread sewing this collection together is Thompson\u2019s effort to literally create soundscapes. A drone piece evokes a cold mountain morning in Taiwan before an earthquake. There\u2019s a song about how light streams through water. Thompson\u2019s sonic travelogue may not be translatable but his sound parcels are always interesting and often beautiful and we can only hope his travel bug is permanent.  TTNIK by Scraps      The synthpop of Brisbane\u2019s Scraps (Laura Hill) is described by her US label Not Not Fun as \u201calienated karaoke\u201d. It\u2019s spot on. She is both solo and solitary sounding, making music to dance to, despondently. No duo or trio could have made a record this entwined in its own logic; reduced to only the rawest sequencer rhythms and most essential melodies, bent to Hill\u2019s will. Notes snake up to coil around her vocals, before sliding away. The backdrop \u2013 enmeshed in the songs through samples \u2013 is the isolation and communion of the Australian suburbs: girls gossiping on the phone; the tipsy chatter of (what sounds like) mums at a pool party; a guy detailing his hobbies in a creepy pitch-shifting voice. Hill is a master of the waning synth note, wringing out every of drop of melancholy from the fades on Touch Blue.  Absolute Truth by Lawrence Arabia             The lyrics of New Zealand musician Lawrence Arabia (James Milne) are snort-out-loud funny but in the manner of Oscar Wilde, they ring true too. \u201cI was so fresh and foolish/Bold and bullish, kind of toolish,\u201d he sings on Brain Gym.  Milne\u2019s fourth album of wry symphonic pop is out on seminal Dunedin label Flying Nun. On his last (excellent) record, Milne made genres like ragtime seem easy and he\u2019s similarly breezy here. There\u2019s a hint of Lambchop\u2019s mid-afternoon languor on The Old Dancefloor and Yo La Tengo\u2019s poised mid-tempo rock. Elsewhere, Milne tosses yacht rock overboard in favour of shameless cruise-ship schmaltz. On Another Century you imagine him as the performer on a late-70s liner, singing for passengers in puffy bathing suits with bronzed leathery skin. Its syrupy swooping strings, fresh-faced falsetto and \u201cshooby do wop\u201d choruses stroll dangerously close to parody, but like Beck circa Midnight Vultures, if you embrace the role-play it\u2019s fun as hell.  Wide Asleep by Sophie Hutchings      As a child, pianist and composer Sophie Hutchings would withdraw to practise alone. It explains her deeply contemplative style as well as her discomfort with playing live. \u201cI pretty much have to be kicked onto stage,\u201d she told music journalist Bernard Zuel. Hutchings\u2019 third record is beautifully accented by cellist Peter Hollo and violinist Jay Kong. Unlike many pianists, she doesn\u2019t dazzle you with virtuosity or solicit your sentimentality. They are certainly no showy crescendos. Instead, her piano holds a healing space for you to enter and make your own. The notes swell and retreat; pool, overflow and spill. Hutchings\u2019 compositions are the sound of a state of flux \u2013 the principle that change is the only constant.

The outburst will have done little to help Japan\u2019s attempts to become a more welcoming destination for foreign visitors as it prepares to host the 2019 rugby World Cup and the Tokyo Olympics a year later. Japan\u2019s successful pitch for the 2020 Games made much of the country\u2019s reputation for omotenashi\u2013 traditional hospitality and service. But there was precious little omotenashi on display when the conductor addressed passengers on a Nankai Electric Railway express train bound for Kansai international airport near Osaka on Monday morning. \u201cThere are many foreign passengers on board today \u2026 this has caused serious congestion and is causing inconvenience to Japanese passengers,\u201d said the conductor, a man in his 40s. A Japanese passenger reported the incident to a station attendant at the airport, questioning whether the conductor\u2019s wording was acceptable. The conductor, who has not been named, later defended his choice of words: \u201cI heard a male Japanese passenger at [another station] yelling: \u2018All these foreigners are a nuisance,\u2019\u201d the Mainichi Shimbun quoted him as saying. \u201cI made the announcement to avert trouble and had no intention of discriminating [against foreign passengers],\u201d he said. A Nankai Electric spokesman told the newspaper that the firm had previously received complaints about foreign visitors with large suitcases, but added: \u201cWhether people are Japanese or non-Japanese, the fact remains that they are our passengers. Language that sets them apart [from other passengers] is inappropriate.\u201d The incident follows an accusation by South Korean tourists that a sushi restaurant in Osaka deliberately smeared their orders with eye-watering quantities of wasabi, a pungent condiment that should be used sparingly. The restaurant chain Ichibazushi apologised but denied accusations of racism, saying its chefs had decided to use excessive amounts of wasabi after other foreign diners had previously requested larger dollops for added piquancy. \u201cBecause many of our overseas customers frequently order extra amounts of pickled ginger and wasabi, we gave them more without checking first,\u201d the chain\u2019s management said. \u201cThe result was unpleasant for some guests who aren\u2019t fans of wasabi.\u201d It was not clear how many such incidents \u2013 labelled \u201cwasabi terrorism\u201d on social media \u2013 had occurred, but some disgruntled diners posted photos of sushi containing twice as much wasabi as usual. Whether or not the incidents resulted from misunderstandings, the potential for friction between visitors and local people is likely to increase as Japan gains popularity as a tourist destination. A record 2.05 million people visited the country in August, according to the Japan Tourism Agency, including 677,000 from China, 458,900 from South Korea and 333,200 from Taiwan. Japan\u2019s government hopes to double the number of foreign visitors to 40 million in 2020, and expects a tourism windfall of 8tn yen (\u00a363bn)."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/11/fresh-off-the-boat-asian-american-stereotypes", "publicationDate": "2016-10-11T16:30:27Z", "tags": ["US television", "ABC", "Television", "Culture", "Race issues"], "sentences": ["For this season, the Huangs have traveled to Taipei, Taiwan, for Louis\u2019s brother\u2019s wedding."], "title": "Fresh Off The Boat shows Hollywood there's life beyond yellowface", "article": "While Fresh Off the Boat takes place in the mid-90s, the ABC sitcom, which returns on Tuesday, has plenty to say about Asian American identity in the present day. In the second season finale, Eddie Huang wants to see Chris Rock\u2019s searing standup special Bring the Pain. Younger brothers Emery and Evan interfere because their mother told him he wasn\u2019t allowed. But after days of bickering, they stop fighting to watch the show together.   Related: Why is Hollywood still using 'yellowface' in 2016?    Months later, while hosting this year\u2019s Oscars, and after asking whether Hollywood is racist, present-day Rock brought out three Asian children wielding briefcases and introduced them as accountants. That actually happened. To make things even worse, the academy had reportedly known about the skit for months. Yes, Hollywood is racist. So, thankfully, Fresh Off the Boat remains a safe haven for viewers who want to see how Asians and Asian Americans can be depicted without being the butt of the joke. To understand the importance of Fresh Off the Boat, start with the 2016 Emmys, during which Master of None won outstanding comedy series. \u201cThere\u2019s 17 million Asian Americans in this country and 17 million Italian Americans,\u201d said the show\u2019s co-creator Alan Yang. \u201cThey have The Godfather, Goodfellas, Rocky, The Sopranos. We\u2019ve got Long Duk Dong.\u201d Then, catch up with the recent whitewashing, from Cameron Crowe casting Emma Stone as a woman named Allison Ng, to Scarlett Johansson starring in a live-action remake of Ghost in the Shell, an anime set in Japan\u2019s dystopian future. More than 13 years after he appeared in the then indie director Justin Lin\u2019s Better Luck Tomorrow, #StarringJohnCho is still only a fantasy. For as long as Fresh Off the Boat exists, Hollywood doesn\u2019t have an excuse for getting it wrong. The industry frets over how Asian actors can\u2019t be \u201cbankable\u201d stars, but the show has thrived because of how its family \u2013 the second Asian American family to get a sitcom since 1994\u2019s All-American Girl \u2013 is at the emotional heart of it all. The Huangs may be the only non-white family living in that Orlando, Florida, cul-de-sac, but the show is solely concerned with their perspective. Home truths are presented in an honest and frank way, from the moment that Eddie (Hudson Yang) makes an earnest plea to his mother about his school dinner (\u201cI need white people lunch\u201d) to when he finally introduces her to his white girlfriend Allison, after being told his whole life to \u201cdate a Chinese girl\u201d. No one is characterized into neat stereotypes. After Eddie\u2019s father, Louis (Randall Park), does Donald Duck impressions on a morning talkshow to promote his steakhouse restaurant, Eddie\u2019s mother, Jessica (Constance Wu), lectures him: \u201cYou know what it reminded me of? Your favorite character from Sixteen Candles.\u201d As Fresh Off the Boat develops, so does our understanding of the family\u2019s diverse taste in American culture. During season one, Jessica doesn\u2019t understand Eddie\u2019s idolization of rappers like the Notorious BIG: \u201cWhy do all your shirts have black men on them?\u201d By season two, though, she has a full-on crush on Denzel Washington. Fresh Off the Boat is about how an Asian American family reckons with their dueling racial identities. This story is about to get even more specific. For this season, the Huangs have traveled to Taipei, Taiwan, for Louis\u2019s brother\u2019s wedding. In that sense, the premise actually bears a striking resemblance to that of Double Cup Love, Eddie Huang\u2019s follow-up to the 2013 memoir that inspired the TV series. \u201cThe first book was, this is how I felt in America. But who am I in China?\u201d he has said. (Huang has actually distanced himself from the show because of how it told a \u201ccornstarch\u201d version of his story.) Meanwhile, all three Huang boys are all supposed to be in bed when they watch Bring the Pain. Eight-year-old Evan, the youngest and most obedient sibling, is engrossed because he finds this HBO special as educational as his daytime kids show fare. \u201cI\u2019m just glad he doesn\u2019t do lame Asian jokes,\u201d he says.

When she started researching her new book, Urban Forests, she\u2019d have struggled to identify the species \u2013 but now, she says, \u201cwhen I see one, I say \u2018Oh my goodness, this is a rare survivor,\u2019 and deeply appreciate the fact that it\u2019s there.\u201d The American elm was once America\u2019s most beloved and abundant city tree. It liked urban soil, and its branches spread out a safe distance above traffic, to provide the dappled shade that cities depended on before air conditioning.  Now, however, most of the big, old elms have been wiped out by Dutch elm disease. Many of them were replaced by ash, which have in turn been killed by another imported pest: the emerald ash borer. By the 1970s, writes Jones, much of America\u2019s urban tree cover had fallen victim to \u201cdisease, development and shrinking municipal budgets\u201d. Thousands of miles away, in Bangkok, the main threat is construction work. After a group of residents tried in vain to save several mature trees on their lane, which were felled to make way for a car park, they formed a tree advocacy group, the Big Trees Project. Within weeks, membership swelled to 16,000. Forestry officer at the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), Simone Borelli tells me of similar tree advocacy groups in Malaysia, India and Central African Republic, where the capital, Bangui, has \u201cgrown out of the forest and is eating it up\u201d.     Elm trees line Fifth Avenue by Central Park in New York. Photograph: Alamy    This month will see representatives from the world\u2019s cities convene in Quito, Ecuador, for the United Nations conference on sustainable urban development, Habitat III. An agreement called the New Urban Agenda will be launched, to address the challenges facing a growing global urban population that already accounts for over 50% of us. The document is littered with references to green spaces being essential for mental and physical health, community building and performing urgent ecological tasks. Research has turned up fascinating evidence as to why town councils, planners and developers \u2013 in whose hands the fate of urban trees lies \u2013 should take heed. Until recently, says Jones, city officials saw trees as \u201cexpensive ornaments\u201d. But what is now known about the ecological services that trees provide is staggering.    Until recently, city officials saw trees as expensive ornaments.    Trees can cool cities by between 2C and 8C. When planted near buildings, trees can cut air conditioning use by 30%, and, according to the UN Urban Forestry office, reduce heating energy use by a further 20-50%. One large tree can absorb 150kg of carbon dioxide a year, as well as filter some of the airborne pollutants, including fine particulates. It\u2019s hard to put a price on how an avenue of plane trees can muffle the roar of a main road, although trees do on average increase the value of property by 20%. Perhaps money does grow on them after all.  When the New York City park department measured the economic impact of its trees, the benefits added up to $120m a year. (Compare that to the $22m annual parks department expenditure.) There were $28m worth of energy savings, $5m worth of air quality improvements and $36m of costs avoided in mitigating storm water flooding. If you look at a big tree, says Jones, \u201cit\u2019s intercepting 1,432 gallons of water in the course of a year.\u201d     A canopy of signs \u2026 Khao San Road in Bangkok.

Everyone knows, if you look at fancy neighbourhoods, they are the ones with the most trees.\u201d By the same token, she observes that underprivileged neighbourhoods are often also undercanopied. Humans are drawn to trees by more than aesthetics. It can bring down cortisol levels in walkers, which means less stress. The effect on our brains is a subject that fascinates UK-based GP and public health expert William Bird.    Related: More trees on your street means fewer health problems, says study    \u201cThe parts of our brain we use change when we connect with nature,\u201d he says. Even in lab-based studies, MRI scanning shows that when viewing urban scenes, blood flow to the amygdala \u2013 the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d part of the brain \u2013 increases. Our brains view cities as hostile environments. Natural scenes, by contrast, light up the anterior cingulate and the insula, where empathy and altruism happen. \u201cIn areas with more trees,\u201d says Bird, \u201cpeople get out more, they know their neighbours more, they have less anxiety and depression.\u201d (Here in the UK, the annual mental health bill is around \u00a370bn.) \u201cBeing less stressed,\u201d he continues, \u201cgives them more energy to be active\u201d. But you can\u2019t fob people off with an empty playing field, he says. \u201cPeople won\u2019t want to go there. We are still programmed as hunter gatherers who look for trees, biodiversity, water and safety.\u201d Research suggests people are less violent when they live near trees. One of the oft-cited examples is a study that looked at women in a Chicago housing estate. Those who lived near the trees reported less mental fatigue and less violent tendencies than those in barren areas of the same estate.     \u2018In areas with more trees, people get out more\u2019: a tree-lined street in Gothenburg. Photograph: Souvid Datta for the Guardian    \u201cWe still know very little about the mechanisms linking trees and health,\u201d says Geoffrey Donovan, research forester with the US Forest Service. But there are theories. One is that nature is so mentally restorative that it gives our minds a rest from the forced, direct attention that modern life and urban environments increasingly call for. It relieves mental fatigue.  A tree psychology study that particularly tickles Jones was done in Toronto by psychology professor Marc Berman, using data sets from the national health system. \u201cHe discovered that, if you have 10 more trees on a city block, it improves health perception as much as having \u00a310,000 more in income, or feeling seven years younger,\u201d she says. Perhaps one of the most striking studies on urban trees is one that showed that they reduce health inequality. In 2008, Rich Mitchell, a public health professor at the University of Glasgow, compared income deprivation and green space exposure across England and his study found \u201chealth inequalities related to income deprivation in all-cause mortality and mortality from circulatory diseases were lower in populations living in the greenest areas\u201d.    Related: 'I\u2019ve known this tree all my life': your photos of urban trees around the world    Back at the US Forest Service, Donovan refers to trees as \u201ca matter of life and death\u201d. \u201cI looked at the impact of trees on birth outcomes and found that mothers with more trees within 50m of their homes are less likely to have underweight babies,\u201d he says. For another study, he looked at mortality rates in areas which have lost millions of trees to emerald ash borer, and identified \u201ca corresponding increase in human mortality\u201d. The value we place on trees and nature is informed by childhood experience. Children growing up dislocated from nature results in, say some researchers, an \u201cextinction of experience\u201d. These children will ultimately understand and value nature less. \u201cThis means,\u201d writes Bird, \u201cthat each generation will pass on less experience of the natural environment \u2013 and as policymakers and future environmentalists they will have a poorer understanding of nature and so give it less value\u201d. Which would not bode well for the FAO Forestry Department\u2019s vision of \u201cgreener, happier, healthier cities\u201d. As Jones says, \u201cbeing an amateur tree appreciator, as I now am, really does transform your enjoyment of being out and about\u201d.

More than 1,000 lives lost? It must be climate change! Almost inevitably, Hurricane Matthew\u2019s recent rampage across the Caribbean and south-eastern US has been fingered by some as a backlash of global warming driven by humanity\u2019s polluting activities, but does this really stack up? The short answer is no. Blame for a single storm cannot be laid at climate change\u2019s door, as reinforced by the bigger picture. The current hurricane season is by no means extraordinary, and the last few seasons have actually been very tame. The 2013 season saw no major hurricanes at all and tied with 1982 for the fewest hurricanes since 1930. This, in turn, is no big deal as there is great year-on-year variability in the level of hurricane activity, which responds to various natural factors such as El Ni\u00f1o and the so-called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, as well as the progressive warming of the oceans as climate change bites harder.   Related: Hurricane Matthew's devastation in Haiti forces UN to call for $120m in aid    The current consensus holds that while a warmer world will not necessarily mean more hurricanes, it will see a rise in the frequency of the most powerful, and therefore more destructive, variety. This view was supported recently by Kerry Emanuel, a hurricane scientist at MIT, who pointed to Matthew as a likely sign of things to come. Debate within the hurricane science community has in recent decades been almost as hostile as the storms themselves, with researchers, on occasion, even refusing to sit on the same panels at conferences. At the heart of this sometimes acrimonious dispute has been the validity of the Atlantic hurricane record and the robustness of the idea that hurricane activity had been broadly ratcheting up since the 1980s. Now, the weight of evidence looks to have come down on the side of a broad and significant increase in hurricane activity that is primarily driven by progressive warming of the climate. For many, the bottom line is the sea surface temperature, which is a major driver of hurricane activity and storm intensification. Last year saw the warmest sea temperatures on record, so it should not be a surprise. As Michael Mann, an atmospheric scientist at Penn State University, says: \u201cIt isn\u2019t a coincidence that we\u2019ve seen the strongest hurricane in both hemispheres [western and eastern] within the last year.\u201d As the Atlantic continues to heat up, the trend is widely expected to be towards more powerful and wetter storms, so that Matthew might seem like pretty small beer when looked back on from the mid-century. As with hurricanes, Pacific typhoons and the mid-latitude storms that periodically batter the UK and Europe are forecast to follow a similar pattern in an anthropogenically warmed world. Storm numbers may not rise, but there is likely to be an escalation in the frequency of the bigger storm systems, which tend to be the most destructive. An additional concern is that mid-latitude storms may become clustered, bringing the prospect of extended periods of damaging and disruptive winds. The jury is out on whether climate change will drive up the number of smaller, but potentially ruinous vortices of solid wind that make up tornadoes, although an apparent trend in the US towards more powerful storms has been blamed by some on a warming atmosphere. Tornadoes, typhoons, hurricanes and mid-latitude storms \u2013 along with heatwaves and floods \u2013 are widely regarded as climate change\u2019s shock troops; forecast to accelerate the destruction, loss of life and financial pain as planet Earth continues to heat up. It would be wrong to imagine, however, that climate change and the extreme events it drives are all about higher temperatures and a bit more wind and rain.    An earthquake fault that is ready to go is like a coiled spring \u2013 all that is needed is the pressure of a handshake    The atmosphere is far from isolated and interacts with other elements of the so-called \u201cEarth system\u201d, such as the oceans, ice caps and even the ground beneath our feet, in complex and often unexpected ways capable of making our world more dangerous. We are pretty familiar with the idea that the oceans swell as a consequence of the plunging atmospheric pressure at the heart of powerful storms, building surges driven onshore by high winds that can be massively destructive. Similarly, it does not stretch the imagination to appreciate that a warmer atmosphere promotes greater melting of the polar ice caps, thereby raising sea levels and increasing the risk of coastal flooding. But, more extraordinarily, the thin layer of gases that hosts the weather and fosters global warming really does interact with the solid Earth \u2013 the so-called geosphere \u2014 in such a way as to make climate change an even bigger threat. This relationship is marvellously illustrated by a piece of research published in the journal Nature in 2009 by Chi-Ching Liu of the Institute of Earth Sciences at Taipei\u2019s Academia Sinica. In the paper, Liu and his colleagues provided convincing evidence for a link between typhoons barrelling across Taiwan and the timing of small earthquakes beneath the island. Their take on the connection is that the reduced atmospheric pressure that characterises these powerful Pacific equivalents of hurricanes is sufficient to allow earthquake faults deep within the crust to move more easily and release accumulated strain. This may sound far fetched, but an earthquake fault that is primed and ready to go is like a coiled spring, and as geophysicist John McCloskey of the University of Ulster is fond of pointing out, all that is needed to set it off is \u2013 quite literally \u2013 \u201cthe pressure of a handshake\u201d. Perhaps even more astonishingly, Liu and his team proposed that storms might act as safety valves, repeatedly short-circuiting the buildup of dangerous levels of strain that otherwise could eventually instigate large, destructive earthquakes. This might explain, the researchers say, why the contact between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea tectonic plates, in the vicinity of Taiwan, has far less in the way of major quakes than further north where the plate boundary swings past Japan. In a similar vein, it seems that the huge volume of rain dumped by tropical cyclones, leading to severe flooding, may also be linked to earthquakes. The University of Miami\u2019s Shimon Wdowinski has noticed that in some parts of the tropics \u2013 Taiwan included \u2013 large earthquakes have a tendency to follow exceptionally wet hurricanes or typhoons, most notably the devastating quake that took up to 220,000 lives in Haiti in 2010. It is possible that floodwaters are lubricating fault planes, but Wdowinski has another explanation. He thinks that the erosion of landslides caused by the torrential rains acts to reduce the weight on any fault below, allowing it to move more easily. It has been known for some time that rainfall also influences the pattern of earthquake activity in the Himalayas, where the 2015 Nepal earthquake took close to 9,000 lives, and where the threat of future devastating quakes is very high. During the summer monsoon season, prodigious quantities of rain soak into the lowlands of the Indo-Gangetic plain, immediately to the south of the mountain range, which then slowly drains away over the next few months. This annual rainwater loading and unloading of the crust is mirrored by the level of earthquake activity, which is significantly lower during the summer months than during the winter.           Nepal earthquake: drone footage shows devastation in ancient town of Bhaktapur    And it isn\u2019t only earthquake faults that today\u2019s storms and torrential rains are capable of shaking up. Volcanoes seem to be susceptible too. On the Caribbean island of Montserrat, heavy rains have been implicated in triggering eruptions of the active lava dome that dominates the Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano. Stranger still, Alaska\u2019s Pavlof volcano appears to respond not to wind or rain, but to tiny seasonal changes in sea level. The volcano seems to prefer to erupt in the late autumn and winter, when weather patterns are such that water levels adjacent to this coastal volcano climb by a few tens of centimetres. This is enough to bend the crust beneath the volcano, allowing magma to be squeezed out, according to geophysicist Steve McNutt of the University of South Florida, \u201clike toothpaste out of a tube\u201d. If today\u2019s weather can bring forth earthquakes and magma from the Earth\u2019s crust, it doesn\u2019t take much to imagine how the solid Earth is likely to respond to the large-scale environmental adjustments that accompany rapid climate change. In fact, we don\u2019t have to imagine at all. The last time our world experienced serious warming was at the end of the last ice age when, between about 20,000 and 10,000 years ago, temperatures rose by six degrees centigrade, melting the great continental ice sheets and pushing up sea levels by more than 120m.    The bottom line is that as climate change tightens its grip, we must be prepared to expect the unexpected    These huge changes triggered geological mayhem. As the kilometres-thick Scandinavian ice sheet vanished, the faults beneath released the accumulated strain of tens of millennia, spawning massive magnitude eight earthquakes. Quakes of this scale are taken for granted today around the Pacific Ocean\u2019s \u201cRing of Fire\u201d, but they are completely out of place in Santa\u2019s Lapland. Across the Norwegian Sea, in Iceland, the volcanoes long buried beneath a kilometre of ice were also rejuvenated as the suffocating ice load melted away, prompting a \u201cvolcano storm\u201d about 12,000 years ago that saw the level of activity increase by up to 50 times. Now, global average temperatures are shooting up again and are already more than one degree centigrade higher than during preindustrial times. It should come as no surprise that the solid Earth is starting to respond once more. In southern Alaska, which has in places lost a vertical kilometre of ice cover, the reduced load on the crust is already increasing the level of seismic activity. In high mountain ranges across the world from the Caucasus in the north to New Zealand\u2019s southern Alps, longer and more intense heatwaves are melting the ice and thawing the permafrost that keeps mountain faces intact, leading to a rise in major landslides. Does this all mean that we are in for a more geologically active future as well as a hotter and meteorologically more violent one? Well, no one is suggesting that we will see a great surge in the number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. As always, these will be controlled largely by local geological conditions. Where an earthquake fault or volcano is primed and ready to go, however, climate change may provide that extra helping hand that brings forward the timing of a quake or eruption that would eventually have happened anyway. As the world continues to heat up, any geological response is likely to be most obvious where climate change is driving the biggest environmental changes \u2013 for example, in areas where ice and permafrost are vanishing fast, or in coastal regions where rising sea levels will play an increasing role. Freysteinn Sigmundsson of the Nordic Volcanological Centre observes that the centre of Iceland is now rising by more than three centimetres a year in response to shrinking glaciers. Studies undertaken by Sigmundsson and his colleagues forecast that the reduced pressures that result will lead to the formation of significant volumes of new magma deep under Iceland. Whether this will translate into more or bigger eruptions remains uncertain, but the aviation chaos that arose from the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption in 2010 provides a salutary warning of the disruption that any future increase in Icelandic volcanic activity may cause across the North Atlantic region.     A cloud of ash rises from the volcano under the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull glacier in Iceland in May, 2010, causing chaos for millions of airline passengers as flights were cancelled across Europe. Photograph: Ingolfur Juliusson/Reuters    Volcanologist Hugh Tuffen, of Lancaster University, is worried about the stability of the more than 10% of active volcanoes that are ice-covered. He says that \u201cclimate change is driving rapid melting of ice on many volcanoes worldwide, triggering unloading as ice is removed. As well as encouraging magma to rise to the surface, leading to increased volcanic activity, removal of ice can also destabilise steep volcano flanks, making hazardous landslides more likely.\u201d The potential for more landslides is also likely to be a problem in high mountain ranges as the ice cover that stabilises rock faces vanishes. Christian Huggel of the University of Zurich has warned that \u201cin densely populated and developed regions such as the European Alps, serious consequences have to be considered from [future] large slope failures\u201d. Looking ahead, one of the key places to watch will be Greenland, where recent findings by a research team led by Shfaqat Khan of Denmark\u2019s Technical University reveal a staggering loss of 272bn tonnes of ice a year over the last decade. GPS measurements show that, like Scandinavia at the end of the last ice age, Greenland and the whole of the surrounding region is already rising in response to the removal of this ice load. Andrea Hampel of the University of Hannover\u2019s Geological Institute, who with colleagues has been studying this behaviour, is concerned that \u201cfuture ice loss may trigger earthquakes of intermediate to large magnitude if the crust underneath the modern ice cap contains faults prone to failure\u201d. More earthquakes in Greenland might not seem like a big deal, but this could have far wider ramifications. About 8,200 years ago, an earthquake linked to the uplift of Scandinavia, triggered the Storegga Slide; a gigantic undersea sediment slide that sent a tsunami racing across the North Atlantic. Run-up heights were more than 20m in the Shetlands and six metres along the east coast of Scotland, and the event has been blamed for the flooding of Doggerland; the inhabited Mesolithic landmass that occupied what is now the southern North Sea. The submerged margins of Greenland are currently not very well mapped, so the likelihood of a future earthquake triggering a landslide capable of generating a major tsunami in the North Atlantic is unknown. Dave Tappin, a tsunami expert at the British Geological Survey, points out that one large, undersea landslide has been identified off the coast of Greenland, but suspects that there may not be sufficient sediment to generate landslides as large as Storegga. Nonetheless, the seismic revival of Greenland is certainly a geological response to climate change that we need to keep an eye on. The bottom line in all of this is that as climate change tightens its grip, we should certainly contemplate more and bigger Hurricane Matthews. However, when it comes to the manifold hazardous by-blows of an overheating planet, and especially those involving the ground we stand on, we must also be prepared to expect the unexpected.

Of 24 countries tracked by the data analysts Euromonitor International, all but one have higher daily calorie consumption from alcoholic drinks than sugary beverages. In the UK, adults are consuming more than 106 calories per head every day from alcoholic drinks, compared with 98 from sugar-sweetened drinks.    Related: Theresa May's first test was obesity and she has failed, say health experts    The highest calorie intake from alcohol is in South Korea, with nearly 168 calories a person each day and only 44 calories from sugary drinks.

The US was not included.   Calories from sugar and alcohol   Sugar has been targeted by health experts and obesity campaigners. A number of governments are introducing taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks which are recognised as a major cause of childhood obesity. But little has been said or done about alcohol, which the new data suggests is more significant even than sugary drinks in obesity in adults. Most people are unaware that alcohol can make you gain weight, because \u2013 unlike food \u2013 the number of calories are not routinely marked on beer cans and bottles of wines and spirits. Yet a large glass of 13% wine contains 228 calories and a standard glass 160 calories. A pint of 4% beer is also around 160 calories. \u201cIn the UK, alcoholic drinks above 1.2% ABV are currently exempt from having to provide calorie information. This research demonstrates clearly that this exemption should now end,\u201d said Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the alcohol health alliance. \u201cThe public have the right to know what is in their drinks, so they can make informed choices about their consumption. These labels should make the public aware, for example, that a pint of standard-strength beer contains around 180 calories, about the same as a packet of crisps, and that a large glass of red wine contains around 200 calories, roughly equivalent to the calories found in a doughnut.\u201d Euromonitor\u2019s nutrition analyst, Sara Petersson, said this did not let sugar off the hook. \u201cIt is very interesting because the whole reason why soft drinks are under attack is because they are liquid calories. We don\u2019t have a compensatory mechanism that says we should eat less after drinking them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt works the same way with alcohol and if anything, not only does it have a worse health effect but it is an appetite stimulant which makes you eat more. That is not to take anything away from the need to reduce sugar. That is crucial because it is a very important source of weight gain.\u201d But, she said, tackling alcohol consumption was also crucial to combatting obesity, which can lead to heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer, and was in danger of crippling health systems around the world. Euromonitor\u2019s nutrition data also shows that the average daily consumption of calories in the world is 1,398 calories, with the lowest amount in India at 761 calories per capita per day and the highest in Belgium at 2,559 calories per capita per day. It also shows that most of the developing countries it tracked (78%) get more calories from packaged food than fresh food."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/oct/19/squids-out-are-there-any-that-it-is-still-ok-to-eat", "publicationDate": "2016-10-19T14:34:16Z", "tags": ["Seafood", "Life and style", "Marine life", "Wildlife", "Environment", "Oceans", "Fishing", "Conservation", "Animals", "IUCN red list of endangered species"], "sentences": ["\u201cFishing occurs on the high seas where it\u2019s more difficult to regulate huge fleets from Argentina, Taiwan, China, Republic of Korea and Spain.\u201d In other words, avoid."], "title": "Squid\u2019s out \u2013 are there any you can still eat?", "article": "It\u2019s chargrilled whole by Jamie Oliver, fried with salt and pepper by Nigella, and probably spiralised by the Hemsley sisters.

But if Pope Francis has his way, a deal to bridge what many believe is an insurmountable divide between the Roman Catholic church and the communist Chinese government could be announced within the next 30 days. According to one person who has closely followed developments, the pope would like to seal a deal before the conclusion on 20 November of the Holy Year of Mercy, which was called by the pontiff to celebrate acts of forgiveness. Any agreement that solves the thorniest issue between the two sides \u2013 the Vatican\u2019s right to appoint its own bishops in China \u2013 would represent the most consequential diplomatic feat of the Francis\u2019s papacy. It would also spur a debate about whether Francis \u2013 a Jesuit who has always promoted the importance of \u201cencounters\u201d but has declined to meet the Dalai Lama \u2013 has been too willing to ignore concerns about human rights and religious freedom for the sake of furthering the Vatican\u2019s own interests in a country that is officially atheist. While evangelical Christianity has seen explosive growth in China, Catholicism has lagged behind. \u201cFor me, China has always been a reference point of greatness. A great country. But more than a country, a great culture, with an inexhaustible wisdom,\u201d the pope told Asia Times this year. Since his election in 2013, there have been subtle signs that the relationship between the Vatican and Beijing has warmed. There was the telegram Francis sent to President Xi Jinping as his papal plane flew in Chinese airspace on the way to Taiwan in 2014, and the gift of a silk print, symbolic of Christianity\u2019s presence in China, that was reportedly given to the pope this month by a representative of Xi, though the accuracy of that story has not been confirmed. Chinese Catholics are free to go to mass and attend church, but barred from proselytising. An \u201cunderground\u201d Catholic church exists, and members and its clergy have faced persecution by authorities. No one believes that negotiations between the two sides will lead to formal diplomatic relations, a move that would force the Vatican to break ties with Taiwan. Jeroom Heyndrickx, a Belgian priest who has championed the negotiations, said the talks were centred on whether the Vatican would be given permission to appoint its own bishops.  There is also a disagreement over the the fate of eight \u201cillegal\u201d bishops appointed by officials in China, some of whom have been excommunicated by the Vatican. \u201cThere have been some efforts at dialogue in the past, but never so intensive and ongoing and with perseverance on both sides,\u201d Heyndrickx said. \u201cThe situation is more hopeful now than it has been in 65 years.\u201d  Reaching an initial agreement on the bishops could make it easier to tackle other issues, such as the fate of the China Catholic Patriotic Association, a state-controlled organisation that controls the church and appoints bishops. Heyndrickx said negotiations between the Vatican and Beijing were set to recommence later this month. A preliminary agreement that was reportedly reached in August would allow the pope to choose bishops from candidates recommended by the CCPA. Church sources have separately told Reuters that China is preparing to ordain at least two new bishops before the end of the year, and these appointments would have the blessing of the Vatican.  The most vocal critic against any such deal is Cardinal Joseph Zen, a former bishop of Hong Kong and critic of China\u2019s human rights record. \u201cIt is unthinkable to leave the initial proposal in the hands of an atheist government who cannot possibly judge the suitability of a candidate to be a bishop,\u201d he wrote in an article for AsiaNews in September.   Related: China arrests Christians who opposed removals of crosses    The apparent warming of relations between Beijing and Vatican coincides with a controversial \u201ccross-removal\u201d campaign in eastern China. Communist party authorities have forced more than 1,200 churches in the heavily Christian region to remove the symbol. Zhang Kai, a prominent Christian lawyer, spent more than six months in secret detention after opposing the campaign.  John Allen, the editor of The Crux, a Catholic publication, said Francis \u2013 like his predecessors, Pope Benedict XVI and John Paul II \u2013 had signalled a willingness to address China\u2019s concerns that the church would be hostile to the state if it was shown any latitude. He said the Vatican was pursuing a \u201chuge long-term interest\u201d in its courting of China, which was controversial in some circles within the church. But the real difficulty in hammering out a deal was not resistance inside the Vatican but rather China\u2019s objections. \u201cThe problem is that Xi has a strong wing of the party apparatus that says if you give the Christians, and the Catholics in particular, an inch, they are going to take a mile. Ultimately this is about who controls the Catholic community. Is the primary loyalty to the state or the pope?,\u201d Allen said. Successive popes have had an answer to that question: it can be both. \u201cBut the Chinese to date are divided on whether that is true,\u201d Allen said. The difference between the current negotiations and previous talks is Francis himself. The first non-European pope is viewed as less political and more sympathetic to interests outside the US and Europe, experts say. Francesco Sisci, a senior researcher at China Renmin University in Beijing, noted that Francis was the first pope to have his homilies translated in China. \u201cOf course, he is not a superstar, he is not as popular as a rock star, but he is known to the Chinese public and that is very different from other popes, who were totally unknown\u201d Sisci said. Richard McGregor, a China expert and author of The Party, said it was not clear why agreeing a deal with the Vatican would be a priority for senior officials. \u201cThere are lots of obstacles in the way of a genuine deal. At the same time, they have many other political priorities in the area of managing and keeping a lid on religion, so it is hard to see why China would compromise.\u201d While a deal would be a propaganda coup for Beijing and put pressure on Taiwan, McGregor said there were \u201cfundamental issues of authority\u201d at stake that would make it hard for the Vatican to demand any guarantees on control of the church in the mainland.  Pope Francis is said to have a special devotion to Mary, the \u201cundoer of knots\u201d. After brokering a deal that saw the US and Cuba restore diplomatic relations last year, the pontiff may find a breakthrough with China during the year of mercy a deal worth doing, no matter how big the knot."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/22/how-has-billionaire-donald-trump-become-the-voice-of-those-left-behind", "publicationDate": "2016-10-22T11:31:23Z", "tags": ["Global development professionals network", "Inequality and development"], "sentences": ["Few support the 20th century revolutionary solution of seizing and redistributing land and assets, as happened after the second world war in China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan."], "title": "How has billionaire Donald Trump become the voice of those left behind?\u200b", "article": "The very inclusion of a specific sustainable development goal (SDG) to reduce inequality is a gamechanger. For a generation or more, any serious mainstream discussions of inequality had been off the table. In the formulation of the millennium development goals all the key players knew that income or asset inequality was to be kept off the agenda. Governing elites and international organisations would hardly acknowledge it as a relevant concept for development, often dismissing inequality focused academics and activists as hard-leftists. Many commentators vehemently argued that inequality promoted competition, by reducing inefficiency, which in turn created jobs and profit. The global financial crash of 2008 and the fallout that continues to affect so many people, has changed the conversation. A small group of people made vast profits while tens of millions lost their jobs, houses and dignity. The evidence of the damage to society caused by high levels of inequality has been re-examined, while new research and popular campaigns have seen a new consensus form relatively rapidly.    Related: How can we reach an SDG target when we're moving in the wrong direction?    Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett set the ball rolling in The Spirit Level. They argued that rising inequality in rich nations negatively impacts on our physical and mental health, education, experience of work and even life satisfaction, and is associated with the use of illegal drugs and mental illness. Detailed studies by Martin Ravallion and World Bank colleagues showed that as inequality rose in poor countries, the poverty-reducing impacts of economic growth declined. Subsequent work revealed how rising inequality also slowed downs rates of improvement in human development indicators. Rising income inequality was bad for the citizens of both rich and poor countries.  The SDG for reducing inequality, with a specific target to \u201cprogressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average\u201d encapsulates the broad acceptance of the perils of inequality, not just between countries, but within them. The fact that the target applies and demands action from all countries enhances its potency as evidence of shifting global norms.  However, this is not a radical goal, such as arguing that top incomes must be capped or that the Gini coefficient must be reduced every year. Rather, it is a modest, reformist goal that seeks to ensure that those at the bottom of the income scale are not left behind as economic growth moves forward.  Yet for all the evidence, the hand-wringing from business elites at Davos, calls from parties across the political spectrum and increasing disaffection with the status quo from those left behind (at least in rich nations), relatively little is being done to seriously address the problem of rising inequality around the world.     The real income of the global top 1% rose by more than 60% over 1988-2008    Since 2000, the incomes of the bottom 40% have experienced slower growth year in, year out. Inequality is rising at spectacular rates. While different measures (wealth or income), different datasets (national accounts or taxation) and different analysts disagree on the detail, they all agree that the wealthiest are getting richer faster than anyone else (except in Latin America). The real income of the global top 1% rose by more than 60% over 1988-2008. Turning this situation around will take a Herculean effort, for two main reasons. First, contemporary capitalism is based on economic processes that permit those who manage to amass money by their brain power or political connections or both, to increase their wealth faster than others. As Thomas Piketty tells us, the returns to capital (owning physical and financial assets) are greater than the returns to labour (working). So the rich get richer.   Related: A 'paradigm shift' is needed from governments to fight poverty    Secondly, when the rich get richer, they have the ability to keep it that way. They are able to shape national and international public policies to such an extent that they remain on a rising tide of prosperity. They can also safeguard national and international patent and competition laws, enabling them to dominate the markets in which they operate, and influence rules which allow them to avoid paying tax.  To top it all, by gaining control of the media plutocrats, the super-rich even persuade the public that inequality is good for everyone. Billionaire Donald Trump somehow becomes the voice of those left behind. Gold taps in private jets seem to be a qualification for public office in what Francis Fukuyama terms \u201cpolitical decay\u201d in the US. So what can be done? Few support the 20th century revolutionary solution of seizing and redistributing land and assets, as happened after the second world war in China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Perhaps more reformist measures are a more popular 21st century answer? In most low income countries, effective public expenditure on domestically-financed education, health and social protection would raise the prospects for sustained growth, structural transformation and welfare advances. The evidence for such policies is clear but, enacting them in the places they are most needed is very problematic. The nature of domestic business and political elites \u2013 often greedy, extractive and predatory \u2013 allied to international business elites and the social norms they transmit, means that socially beneficial policies are not effectively implemented.     Brazilian Maria Nilza, 36, and mother of four, shows her bolsa familia social plan card. Photograph: Vanderlei Almeida/AFP/Getty Images    Significantly reducing inequality doesn\u2019t have to be the stuff of utopian dreamers. In Brazil, a sustained decline in inequality levels has been of the most striking aspects of its development performance over the last 10 years. In addition to raising an estimated 40 million people out of poverty, the Brazil\u2019s Gini coefficient fell by 12%, from 0.59 in 1995 to 0.52 in 2012. While inequality in Brazil remains high, this reduction stands in stark contrast to other OECD and Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries, which have seen levels rise.   Related: The e-waste mountains - in pictures    Recently published research investigating the Brazilian development model looked in detail at the factors behind this trend. An estimated 35-50% of the reduction in inequality in Brazil can be attributed to changes in non-labour incomes, largely as a result of growing social assistance programmes. Despite costing just 0.7% of GDP, the extremely effective targeting of the  bolsa familia, a conditional cash transfer scheme, has been vital. A further 10% or so can be attributed to demographic factors, particularly the declining household size among poorer families. The remaining 40-55% is attributed to changes in the distribution of labour earnings. This had previously been attributed to the effects of an increasingly educated workforce, but our research suggests that reduced wage gaps for women and ethnic minorities actually made the biggest impact. Achieving the SDG target to reduce inequality will require a huge shift in how economies and political systems operate right around the world. Some Latin American countries, such as Brazil, demonstrate that sustained reductions in inequality are achievable, when there\u2019s a fairly explicit shift in the social contract, enabling politically difficult decisions to be taken and sustained over a long period. As Angus Deaton tells us, humanity has made amazing progress in reducing income poverty and raising health standards. The next big task is reducing inequality so that we can all enjoy a better life.  Reducing inequality in every country will be extremely difficult. But a growing tide of protest and its consequences (sometimes socially progressive and sometimes regressive) may persuade the 1% that they will not get the world they want for their grandchildren if business continues as usual.

On Monday, the 32-year-old was having his first proper meal as a newly free man in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. Two days earlier, he and fellow sailors from Vietnam, Taiwan, Cambodia, Indonesia and China, captured in March 2012 south of the Seychelles, had been released in exchange for a ransom.  Bile Hussein, the pirates\u2019 representative, claimed in comments reported by one news agency that the value of that ransom was $1.5m (\u00a31.2m), a figure that could not be independently confirmed.  The men\u2019s handover represented \u201cthe end of captivity for the last remaining seafarers taken hostage during the height of Somali piracy\u201d, said the NGO Oceans Beyond Piracy (OBP). The Taiwan-owned Naham 3 crew were the second-longest held hostages by Somali pirates. Only one other group, who were released in 2015 after five years, were held longer.  \u201cWe were treated like animals, so it feels good to be human again,\u201d Libref told the Guardian via phone as he waited to be repatriated to the Philippines, where he hopes to join his family later this week. He said he was thrilled to be free. \u201cI\u2019m full of happiness,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a surprise; we didn\u2019t expect to be released ... If you believe in God, hope is always there \u2013 we were in the hands of pirates yet there was hope, there was a miracle and we\u2019re back in normality.\u201d The happiness of those who were freed, however, may be tinged with the grief felt for those who did not make it. The Naham 3 crew had originally numbered 29, but the captain was killed on the day the ship was hijacked and two others \u201csuccumbed to illness during their captivity\u201d, according to OBP.  Details of how the sailors were released \u2013 and who paid a ransom \u2013 have been kept under wraps. What is known is that the men\u2019s torment came to an end when they were flown to Nairobi on Sunday evening. Images taken at the Jomo Kenyatta international airport show the former hostages, tears in their eyes, hugging each other in disbelief.  John Steed, a retired British colonel who helped to negotiate the release as coordinator of the Hostage Support Partners (HSP), was on the plane to bring the men to Kenya.  \u201cWe flew into Somalia yesterday to the city of Galkayo, which is one of these divided cities with a lot of fighting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe picked them up in an airstrip outside the city, and they were handed to us by a local community, elders and regional administration, and flew them back here to Nairobi, where they are having medical care.\u201d Steed said the hostages were beginning to open up, talking about \u201chow cruel the pirates were and how they beat them up and tortured them\u201d. Some of their account is harrowing. The hostages have said that two of the sailors who subsequently died were then kept inside the freezer.  After being captured, Libref and his fellow hostages were kept on board Naham 3 for a year and a half before being taken to land. The OBP said trawler was initially tethered to another hijacked vessel, the MV Albedo, but that both had subsequently sunk, on separate occasions.  \u201cWhen the MV Albedo began to sink, with its crew onboard, the crew of the Naham 3 courageously assisted in their rescue by jumping into the ocean to save the drowning seafarers. Over a year after its capture, the Naham 3 sank and the crew was brought ashore, where they were subject to much greater risks,\u201d according to OBP. Out in the forest, Libref said the hostages became so hungry they ate rats. \u201cWe suffered a lot, we only ate rice, beans, flour, wheat, so we were forced to catch rats; we had to survive,\u201d he said. They made nets out of rope and tree trunks to capture rats and birds, using rice as bait.  Arnel Balbero, another of the captives, told the BBC his time as a hostage had left him feeling like the \u201cwalking dead\u201d.  Many people went to greet the hostages as they arrived in Nairobi, but the presence of one person took all 26 of them by surprise. Michael Scott Moore is a US journalist who had spent five months with them on Naham 3. Moore, who was captured while researching a book on piracy in Somalia, was released in 2014. He said he had got along well with all the former hostages, especially the five Filipinos, who spoke English. He said their tales of captivity were an indication of how badly they were treated.  \u201cI was totally hungry. I lost a lot of weight but I wasn\u2019t so desperate that I felt that I needed to catch birds,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo of them died of disease; what they always do is throw drugs at the person who is sick. When I came down with something actually serious, they tested my blood, and they found it was malaria and they brought me the proper medication. The fact that they didn\u2019t do that with these guys tells you that on an individual level, the circumstances were worse for each one of them.\u201d Piracy off Somalia\u2019s coast was once a serious threat to the global shipping industry, but the number of attacks has declined sharply in recent years since vessels began carrying armed guards and EU naval forces increased patrols. No commercial ship has been successfully attacked for about four years, but observers warn the threat remains.  The OBP said on Saturday: \u201cWhilst there has not been a successful attack on a commercial vessel since 2012, there have been a number of attacks on fishing vessels and there remain a number of hostages still held in Somalia.\u201d Among those still far from freedom are 10 Iranians and three Kenyans. In 2015, at least 306 seafarers were attacked in the region.

Edible bananas are the result of a genetic accident in nature that created the seedless fruit we enjoy today. Virtually all the bananas sold across the western world belong to the so-called Cavendish subgroup of the species and are genetically nearly identical. These bananas are sterile and dependent on propagation via cloning, either by using suckers and cuttings taken from the underground stem or through modern tissue culture.   Related: Can agroecology feed the world and save the planet?    The familiar bright yellow Cavendish banana is ubiquitous in supermarkets and fruit bowls, but it is in imminent danger. The vast worldwide monoculture of genetically identical plants leaves the Cavendish intensely vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Fungal diseases severely devastated the banana industry once in history and it could soon happen again if we do not resolve the cause of these problems. Plant scientists, including us, are working out the genetics of wild banana varieties and banana pathogens as we try to prevent a Cavendish crash. One of the most prominent examples of genetic vulnerability comes from the banana itself. Up until the 1960s, Gros Michel, or \u201cBig Mike,\u201d was the prime banana variety grown in commercial plantations. Big Mike was so popular with consumers in the west that the banana industry established ever larger monocultures of this variety. Thousands of hectares of tropical forests in Latin America were converted into vast Gros Michel plantations.   Related: On the brink: Queensland\u2019s banana growers live in fear of a deadly fungus    But Big Mike\u2019s popularity led to its doom, when a pandemic whipped through these plantations during the 1950s and \u201860\u2019s. A fungal disease called Fusarium wilt or Panama disease nearly wiped out the Gros Michel and brought the global banana export industry to the brink of collapse. A soil-borne pathogen was to blame: the fungus infected the plants\u2019 root and vascular system. Unable to transport water and nutrients, the plants wilted and died. Fusarium wilt is very difficult to control \u2013 it spreads easily in soil, water and infected planting material. Fungicide applications in soil or in the plant\u2019s stem are as of yet ineffective. Moreover, the fungus can persist in the soil for several decades, thus prohibiting replanting of susceptible banana plants.    Yearly, it can take 50 or more applications of chemicals to control the disease    Cavendish bananas are resistant to those devastating Fusarium wilt strains, so were able to replace the Gros Michel when it fell to the disease. Despite being less rich in taste, and despite the logistical challenges involved with merchandising this fruit to international markets at an acceptable quality, Cavendish eventually replaced Gros Michel in commercial banana plantations. The entire banana industry was restructured, and to date, Cavendish accounts for 47% of the bananas grown worldwide and 99% of all bananas sold commercially for export to developed countries. But the Cavendish unfortunately has its own weaknesses \u2013 most prominently susceptibility to a disease called Black Sigatoka. The fungus Pseudocercospora fijiensis attacks the plants\u2019 leaves, causing cell death that affects photosynthesis and leads to a reduction in fruit production and quality. If Black Sigatoka is left uncontrolled, banana yields can decline by 35-50%. Cavendish growers currently manage Black Sigatoka through a combination of pruning infected leaves and applying fungicides. Yearly, it can take 50 or more applications of chemicals to control the disease. Such heavy use of fungicides has negative impacts on the environment and the occupational health of the banana workers, and increases the costs of production. It also helps select for survival the strains of the fungus with higher levels of resistance to these chemicals: as the resistant strains become more prevalent, the disease gets harder to control over time.     A crop duster plane sprays fungicide over a banana plantation in the southern Philippine island of Mindanao. Photograph: Romeo Gacad/AFP/Getty Images    To further aggravate the situation, Cavendish is also now under attack from a recently emerged strain of Fusarium oxysporum, known as Tropical race 4 (TR4). First identified in the early 1990s in Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia, TR4 has since spread to many south-east Asian countries and on into the Middle East and Africa. If TR4 makes it to Latin America and the Caribbean region, the export banana industry in that part of the world could be in big trouble. Cavendish varieties have shown little if any resistance against TR4. Growers are relying on temporary solutions \u2013 trying to prevent it from entering new regions, using clean planting materials and limiting the transfer of potentially infected soil between farms. Black Sigatoka and Panama disease both cause serious production losses and are difficult to control. With the right monitoring in place to rapidly intervene and halt their spread, the risks and damage imposed by these diseases can be considerably reduced, as has been recently shown in Australia. But current practices don\u2019t provide the durable solution that\u2019s urgently needed. If there\u2019s a lesson to be learned from the sad history of Gros Michel, it\u2019s that reliance on a large and genetically uniform monoculture is a risky strategy that is prone to failure. To reduce the vulnerability to diseases, we need more genetic diversity in our cultivated bananas. Over a thousand species of banana have been recorded in the wild. Although most do not have the desired agronomic characteristics \u2013 such as high yields of seedless, non-acidic fruits with long shelf life \u2013 that would make them a direct substitute for the Cavendish, they are an untapped genetic resource. Scientists could search within them for resistance genes and other desirable traits to use in engineering and breeding programs.    If there\u2019s a lesson to be learned, it\u2019s that reliance on a large and genetically uniform monoculture is a risky strategy    To date, though, there\u2019s been little effort and insufficient funding for collecting, protecting, characterizing and utilizing wild banana genetic material. Consequently, while almost every other crop used for food production has been significantly improved through plant breeding over the last century, the banana industry has yet to benefit from genetics and plant breeding. But we have started taking the first steps. We now know the genome sequences of the banana and the fungi that cause Fusarium wilt and Sigatoka. These studies helped illuminate some of the molecular mechanisms by which these fungal pathogens cause disease in the banana. That knowledge provides a basis for identifying disease-resistant genes in wild and cultivated bananas. Researchers now have the tools to identify resistance genes in wild bananas or other plant species. Then they can use classical plant breeding or genetic engineering to transfer those genes into desired cultivars. Scientists can also use these tools to further study the dynamics and evolution of banana pathogens in the field, and monitor changes in their resistance to fungicides. Availability of the latest tools and detailed genome sequences, coupled with long-term visionary research in genetics, engineering and plant breeding, can help us keep abreast of the pathogens that are currently menacing the Cavendish banana. Ultimately we need to increase the pool of genetic diversity in cultivated bananas so we\u2019re not dependent on single clones such as the Cavendish or the Gros Michel before it. Otherwise we remain at risk of history repeating itself.

Summer in New York makes one acutely aware of the near-constant presence of waste piling up on pavements waiting to be collected and trucked to an out-of-state landfill. New York is, in fact, widely reported to be the world\u2019s most wasteful city. Wastefulness in this case means New York uses the most energy (\u201cthe equivalent of one oil supertanker every 1.5 days\u201d), disposes of the most trash (33m tonnes per year), and uses the most water. The dubious title comes from a study published last spring in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). While the world\u2019s most wasteful city could well be in the consumption-rich US, New York is an unlikely culprit. If the world\u2019s most wasteful city is American, as it very well may be, it\u2019s probably a sprawling sunbelt metropolis like Houston, Atlanta, Tampa, or Phoenix \u2013 all of which rate worse than New York on most environmental metrics but weren\u2019t included in that particular study. Among global megacities, Mexico City generates the most trash after the New York region: 12m tonnes per year. That\u2019s largely a function of relative wealth: the regions have similar population sizes of just over 20 million and 21 million people respectively, but GDP per capita is three times higher in the US.           The parody rubbish film that went viral in Beirut    But waste is a bigger quality of life problem in Mexico. At least the steaming trash in New York is being put out for the sanitation trucks. In 2011, Mexico City closed its largest dump, causing trash to pile up at illegal dumping sites and be left out on the street, highlighting the absence of a comprehensive policy for urban waste collection, disposal and processing. There are signs of hope, though. A number of recycling initiatives have been launched, including one that allows residents to trade in recyclables for vouchers to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables. The third biggest waste producer among megacities is Tokyo, which is actually impressively austere. Greater Tokyo has more than 50% more residents than Mexico City, but it produces slightly less rubbish. Japan is very densely populated, and so it lacks the space that the US and China have to throw their garbage in landfills. Instead, they have adopted hyper-aggressive recycling programmes to cut down on waste. Tokyo, which strives to be a zero-waste city, is no exception.    The wealthier a place is, the more is wasted and thrown.  Alex Kovac, World Resources Institute     So how can Tokyo be rated the third most wasteful city? This is the tricky thing about measuring wastefulness: waste is a byproduct of consumption, and consumption generally tracks with income. \u201cThere are some general rules for consumption levels: as income rises, people just cycle through more consumption patterns in general,\u201d says Alex Kovac, a research analyst at the World Resources Institute, an international environmental research organisation. \u201cThe wealthier a place is, the more is wasted and thrown.\u201d A city\u2019s waste rate, Morton says, roughly follows that of the country it\u2019s in. According to a World Bank study from 2012, the most recent on the subject, New Zealand generated the most garbage, 3.68kg per person every day, among developed countries, followed by Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, and the US. But the data on smaller countries may be failing to account for recycling.  Norway, for example, has high rates of recycling and Oslo, its largest city, has successfully reduced its waste production in recent years. Ireland, on the other hand, has lower recycling rates than in the rest of western Europe. Dublin might be one of the most wasteful cities in Europe, but it is still only a second-tier competitor for world\u2019s most wasteful city, as its greenhouse gas emissions are still only half the rate of the US or Australia.      Tokyo is densely populated, so doesn\u2019t have the space for landfills. Photograph: Yuya Shino/EPA    The US is the world\u2019s biggest producer of trash in absolute terms, generating 624,700 metric tonnes per day, which is 2.58kg/capita. That\u2019s considerably more than many other rich countries, such as Japan\u2019s 1.71kg/capita, the UK\u2019s 1.79kg and France\u2019s 1.92kg. According to a 2010 study by the water bottle company Nalgene \u2013 which measured self-reported behaviours such as using public transportation, recycling, and conserving electricity \u2013 the five most wasteful of the US\u2019s 25 largest cities are Houston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Tampa and Indianapolis, in that order. Nalgene found New York was found to be the third least wasteful, after San Francisco and Seattle. (On the subject of water waste, Phoenix, which is built in a desert, devotes half of its residential water use to irrigate lawns.) In China, waste is growing twice as fast as the population. As the Globe and Mail notes, China now produces an average of 1.12kg per person per day of residential waste, nearly 10% more than the average in Ontario, even though China\u2019s GDP per capita is more than six times lower. Chinese cities don\u2019t recycle, meaning that their waste output could be cut in half, as it has been in neighbouring Taiwan. China doesn\u2019t break out its waste data by city, but some Chinese cities with notable refuse problems include Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, which have started building trash incinerators to pick up the slack from a shortage of landfill capacity. But burning trash, in turn, just worsens their notoriously dirty air. Guangzhou has also started charging households that exceed 1 litre of rubbish per day.     A garbage collector in Beijing. Some Chinese cities have started burning waste, worsening air pollution. Photograph: Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters    Which cities have the worst waste problem also depends on how they dispose of it. Most wasteful as measured by total garbage created, will knock out almost all developing world cities, for the simple reason that they cannot afford to buy and waste as much. But if you\u2019re talking about some of the local problems associated with trash, like having it piling up in your streets, some of the world\u2019s poorest cities, such as Manila and Port-au-Prince, have very big problems indeed. Without the infrastructure to collect garbage, it\u2019s dumped in rivers, canals and streets, and the result is unsanitary chaos. Other developing cities that are overburdened with trash they cannot process include those with fast-growing economies such as Bangalore and Delhi. Mumbai produces the fifth most waste of any megacity, and last year Bloomberg reported it was \u201cbeing buried under a mountain of its own trash\u201d. The city of over 18 million people produces 11,000 metric tonnes of trash per day. Plastic wrappers and bottles fill the gutters, backyard waste burning contributes to air pollution, and the rest winds up in a giant open landfill. In Delhi, which experienced a 50% increase in waste between 2007 and 2012, the lack of formal trash pick-up systems leads to rubbish mountains and impoverished waste pickers sorting through it for anything that can be reused or resold. Delhi\u2019s garbage problem and its overwhelming smog could certainly make it the world\u2019s dirtiest city.     Men scavenge for coins and re-usable items in the Yamuna river in New Delhi, India. Photograph: Prakash Singh/AFP/Getty    Rapid population growth itself may also be a risk factor. Jakarta, for example, is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing cities and many of its residents are in the habit of dumping their household items in the nearest waterway. So much makes its way out to sea that 100 tonnes of garbage a day is collected on the beaches of an island five miles away. Even a rich city can find it impossible to stash away all its waste if it\u2019s too tightly packed. Hong Kong is on the precipice of running out of space in its landfills. A decade ago, Singapore had the same problem, but it implemented policies to boost recycling and burn trash for energy. Now it puts only 2% of its waste in landfills. That\u2019s not without its own drawback: burning rubbish creates air pollution, from carbon emissions to toxins and particulates. Cairo\u2019s trash problem is unique: not only does it produce 625 kg per person per year of solid waste \u2013 a very high rate for a poorer country \u2013 but its system of trash pickers, and feeding waste to pigs, have been disrupted by political instability, religious disapproval of pigs by the temporary Muslim Brotherhood government and an outbreak of swine flu. Whichever of these cities is truly the world\u2019s most wasteful, New York probably doesn\u2019t take the crown after all. The 2015 study titling it thus misleadingly measured its metropolitan region, rather than the city itself. New York City\u2019s metro region includes large swathes of suburbia and satellite cities spread across three states. What\u2019s more, the study only took into account megacities over 10 million people, leaving out a whole host of incredibly wasteful smaller cities.   Related: What does New York do with all that trash? One city's waste \u2013 in numbers    Throughout the United States, suburbanites have much larger carbon footprints than those who live in the centre of a city. That discrepancy is very pronounced in New York, thanks to the city\u2019s unusually high share of non-drivers and relatively small homes. New York City also has aggressive recycling programmes that are currently expanding beyond paper, metals, and plastics to compost food waste.  The greater density, more pedestrian-oriented urban planning, and vastly superior mass transit networks in Europe and Japan make their cities and suburban towns much more energy efficient than most of the US. Waste charging schemes like \u201cpay as you throw\u201d, food waste projects, widespread recycling, ultimately policies committing to zero waste, are just some of the ways in which cities can become a lot less wasteful. That, and cutting consumption.

Some countries are managing digital change better than others.  \u201cThe emerging economies of Asia are moving really fast and are at the top of the pile,\u201d Hajkowicz says. \u201cSingapore usually comes to the top of the list on the World Economic Forum rankings. They are very quick to adopt and capitalise on new technologies. There are government policies in place, the private sector is moving quickly, there\u2019s evidence of a lot of technology uptake and the education systems are responding.\u201d Singapore is training a workforce ready to tackle technological innovation. Its students are among the world\u2019s top performers in science and maths, according to the 2012 OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) rankings, which tested 15-year-olds in more than 60 countries. Other high performers were Taiwan, Korea, Finland, Switzerland, and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China. Countries that are lagging behind, or could do better \u2013 such as Australia \u2013 are desperate to improve their performance in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects to fill what has become known as the STEM skills shortage. Those countries that perform well in STEM have several attributes in common, according to the Australian Council of Learned Academies, which reported to the Prime Minister\u2019s Science Engineering and Innovation Council on STEM country comparisons in 2013.  These include:  Highly esteemed, well-paid teachers Compulsory disciplinary content Reform to encourage more engaging, problem/inquiry-based learning, and critical and creative thinking Prestige attached to careers in science Strategic bipartisan national STEM policy frameworks Targets to motivate collaborative action  The US came up with just such a target in 2012, when it announced its aim to have one million additional college graduates with STEM degrees in 10 years in a bid to fill labour shortages.

Photograph: Chinnaphong Mungsiri/Getty Images    A cultural push Professor David Wilkinson, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Corporate Engagement and Advancement) at Macquarie University, points to Israel as an example of a country that is leading the way in terms of digital transformation. Israel is known \u201cthe Start-up Nation\u201d. With astonishing rates of R&amp;D expenditure, venture capital and start-ups per capita, and an extremely high proportion of scientists and engineers, Israel has become the nearest thing to Silicon Valley outside California. So much so that the Israeli tech scene is sometimes called Silicon Wadi (Hebrew for valley). In 2010 Israel raised 20 times more venture capital, per head of population, than Australia, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.  Multinationals including Intel, IBM and Microsoft are among almost 300 foreign companies to have R&amp;D centres in Israel, according to the City of Tel Aviv. And a country with a population of just 8.5 million has an estimated 3000 to 5000 start-ups and 300,000 people employed in high-tech industries. Long-standing strong government support for commercial R&amp;D has played a big role in Israel\u2019s ongoing tech innovation success. But there\u2019s also something about the Israeli character \u2013 chutpaz, perhaps \u2013 that helps people make the leap into start-ups, says Ben Lang, co-founder of the start-up community, Innovation Israel. \u201cThe culture plays a big part,\u201d Lang says. \u201cIt has a lot to do with the personality of the entrepreneurs. It\u2019s something very unique to the ecosystem here.\u201d The fact that everyone does national service also helps, Lang says. \u201cSo much of the start-up community is influenced by their service in the IDF [Israeli Defence Forces]. What unit they served in, people they know. Since everyone is required to serve in the army, that\u2019s where the networking and lots of learning occurs.\u201d But while some countries are obviously managing digital change better than others, Professor Wilkinson says innovation can be found all over the globe, sometimes in surprising areas. \u201cI have a deep personal interest in Africa, for example, and know of many hubs of innovation, incubation and digital disruption there,\u201d Professor Wilkinson says. \u201cOf course many such settings don\u2019t have much depth and breadth, but once the change takes hold, it will spread.\u201d   Related: The age of collaboration    From the States to Spain Inspiration can be found everywhere. In the US, the Brookings Insitution, a non-profit public policy organisation, describes innovation districts as the \u201cultimate mash-up of entrepreneurs and educational institutions, start-ups and schools, mixed-use development and medical innovations, bike-sharing and bankable investments \u2013 all connected by transit, powered by clean energy, wired for digital technology, and fuelled by caffeine.\u201d Economic, physical, and networking assets combine with a supportive, risk-taking culture to create what Brookings calls an innovation ecosystem: \u201ca synergistic relationship between people, firms and place (the physical geography of the district) that facilitates idea generation and accelerates commercialisation.\u201d Brookings\u2019 work has helped inform Macquarie University\u2019s ongoing development of its own innovation district in Sydney\u2019s Macquarie Park. \u201cBrookings has characterised and codified the model beautifully,\u201d Professor Wilkinson says. He says the Brookings model or \u201cplaybook\u201d is clear, and can be adjusted for each setting. \u201cThere is also a very useful audit and evaluation framework,\u201d he says. \u201cI have visited many innovation districts and the key principles play out in each \u2013 but being sensitive to local needs is essential.\u201d Meanwhile, as the Spanish economy recovers from its years in the doldrums, the Barcelona start-up scene is an exciting place to be, says Scott Mackin, the American founder of Barcinno, a community-driven English-language platform that shares news of the local start-up scene as well as hosting events and workshops and helping inbound companies settle in the city. \u201cBarcelona is poised for exponential growth in the next five to 10 years.\u201d Mackin says. \u201cOn the whole, we\u2019re still a very young and immature start-up ecosystem, but that is rapidly changing\u2026 investors are coming in from all sides to get a piece of the action.\u201d As an English-language platform, Barcinno helps Spanish start-ups reach an international audience. Mackin describes it as \u201ca two-way bridge of talent, capital and information between Barcelona and the global business community\u201d. The Spanish Government has done a good job in supporting entrepreneurship, City Hall has been active in branding Barcelona an \u201cinnovation capital\u201d, and the city has world-class business, polytechnic and research facilities, which together makes a potent combination, Mackin says.

(In Australia) all happening and will happen more and more, whatever government does or does not do  Professor Wilkinson     Hajkowicz says Australia is lagging behind the rising economies of Asia, particularly in areas such as high-speed broadband connectivity and having a workforce qualified to take on the digital age. The Government acknowledged the need for action last December, when it launched the National Innovation and Science Agenda (NISA), a $1.1 billion, four-year program to incentivise innovation and entrepreneurship, reward risk taking, and promote science, maths and computing in schools.  Launching the agenda, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull noted that Australia has some good things going for it: strong economic fundamentals; direct access to Asia; a global reputation for goods and services; and quality scientific research organisations.  But it also has obstacles: a low appetite for risk, which can make it hard for start-ups to attract capital; declining participation in science, maths and computing at high school; and a consistent ranking of last or second last among OECD countries for business research collaboration.  \u201cIncreasing collaboration between businesses, universities and the research sector is absolutely critical for our businesses to remain competitive,\u201d the Prime Minister said. Hajkowicz welcomed the initiative.  \u2018It\u2019s a really important agenda,\u201d he says. \u201cEssentially Australia has to make a transition in its economy from where we are now to a much more advanced hi-tech economy that is much better plugged in to the Asian economies around us.  \u201cThe NISA package is a key policy tool instrument to help us make this leap. But there is still a how-to factor to building an innovative economy that we haven\u2019t resolved. We don\u2019t really know how to do it.  \u201cDo we just build infrastructure and hope they will all come? Or do we pick winners and choose industries? Should we be trying to invest big time in the fintech sector because we think it is going to be a huge industry? Or do we just let the marketplace sort itself out? There are some unanswered questions there.\u201d Professor Wilkinson was also glad to see the NISA package launched, though he has reservations. \u201cNISA has encouraged and enabled the conversation,\u201d Professor Wilkinson says. \u201cIt is important for that alone.

But this year revellers march in the knowledge that they may be on the cusp of making civil rights history in terms of marriage equality. It would be a hard-fought victory for Taiwan\u2019s LGBT community, but also one tinged with sadness after the suspected suicide of Frenchman Jacques Picoux, on 16 October became a rallying call against the failure of the government to make progress on legalising same-sex marriage. Picoux, 67, who taught French at the National Taiwan University, died after falling from the tenth floor of his Taipei apartment block. Friends believe he had taken his own life. They blamed depression after the death last year by cancer of his Taiwanese partner of 35 years, Tseng Ching-chao. Picoux had reportedly been crushed when his lack of legal status denied him the right to participate in crucial medical decisions in Tseng\u2019s final moments. He later found himself with no legal claim over the property they shared. After his death the gay community lashed out against the government led by president Tsai Ing-wen, who was elected in January on a pledge to boost equality rights.   Related: Chinese student lodges suit over homosexuality terms in textbooks    \u201cHow many more human lives do we have to lose as a result of the government\u2019s gross negligence?\u201d charged prominent rights group, the Taiwan LGBT hotline association. However, Picoux\u2019s personal tragedy generated such public sympathy that lobby group Pride Watch Taiwan, has described it as a \u201cpivotal moment\u201d in the gay rights movement. A new draft bill tabled by the ruling Democratic Progressive party [DPP] on Monday to amend family law in favour of LGBT rights was a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d, they said.  \u201cWe actually can see that there are about 66 legislators who will probably vote yes on marriage equality,\u201d said Pride Watch activist, Cindy Su. \u201cThat\u2019s a majority of 58.4%, the first time in Taiwanese history that we have more than half,\u201d she said. Recent polls also show a public majority in favour of same-sex marriage. Sitting in her parliamentary office, the DPP\u2019s Yu Mei-nu, who drafted the new law, freely admits that she would not have such strong support if it had not been for Picoux\u2019s death. \u201cThis story touched people,\u201d she said. \u201cThe LGBT group were very angry. It has put a lot of pressure on our party and on other parties.\u201d Taiwan\u2019s progress towards legalising gay marriage is largely down to Yu\u2019s efforts. Under the previous administration, ruled by the Kuomintang party, she steered a similar draft law through two years of negotiations, only to have it collapse when legislators were too afraid to turn up for a final vote. Yu admits she felt \u201csomewhat upset\u201d, but believes it prepared the ground for future success. \u201cThis time it is time,\u201d she said. Taiwanese society and the parliament were more ready to accept changes to the civil code to grant gay couples equal rights in marriage, parental authority and freedom from discrimination in adoption cases. Yu is optimistic the law can be introduced as early as next year. Jay Lin, the organiser of Taiwan\u2019s first awards ceremony for promoting LGBT rights, which was due to take place on Friday, said much still had to be done to break down societal taboos about gay relationships, but conceded that Picoux\u2019s death had softened public attitudes.  A day after Yu\u2019s bill was published, Picoux and Tseng\u2019s ashes were scattered together in the sea on Taiwan\u2019s southeast coast. \u201cThat tragedy really brought it home. It\u2019s not just legislation or a piece of paper, it\u2019s about love and commitment and not being able to fulfil that,\u201d said Lin. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

The UK performance comes despite widespread difficulties experienced by many British fashion brands after a warm autumn and winter last year.

Normally I wouldn\u2019t even consider cycling on such an expanse of road, but it\u2019s not so bad in Detroit. After all, the birthplace of America\u2019s car industry doesn\u2019t have that many cars any more. My ride along Jefferson Avenue passes the low bulk of Chrysler\u2019s car assembly factory. Along with General Motors\u2019 Hamtramck plant, it is all that remains of the once-great industry which supported this city. Where there were 285,000 jobs, now there are just 10,000.  In 1940, Detroit was the fourth largest city in the US; now it doesn\u2019t even make the top 20. From a peak of 1.8 million inhabitants, the population now stands at 677,000.  But the city is resurgent \u2013 and its near-total collapse may unwittingly have created one of its most powerful and unique assets. The well-documented flight to Detroit\u2019s sprawling suburbs killed the city inside, but it also left space. The wide rivers of asphalt carved deep into the city were designed to transport a population three times its current size.      Detroit\u2019s regenerated riverside. Cycling is up 400% since 2000. Photograph: Nick Van Mead    Now the city\u2019s new director of planning, Maurice Cox, wants to take all this space and transform Jefferson Avenue, and a number of other major arteries, into European-style \u201cgrand boulevards\u201d. Cox says he can reduce motor traffic here to four lanes without affecting journey times \u2013 which would leave five lanes for wider pavements, protected cycle lanes, more greenery and space set aside for future streetcars or a bus rapid transit (BRT) system. Across the city, Cox has decreed that all future bike lanes must be physically separated from motor traffic. With little active opposition, the pace of change will be fast; by the end of next year, Detroit will have 25 miles of new segregated cycle facilities. Advocates say this will catapult the city from 70th in the US rankings of protected lanes to a likely place in the top five, above Minneapolis and Portland. Cox envisions a Detroit taken \u201cback to the future\u201d, before the car became king and when cycling and walking coexisted. \u201cWe still have the framework for that kind of city, but we haven\u2019t nurtured it for decades,\u201d he says. \u201cIn so many cities we have cars, pedestrians and cyclists jostling for space, but here they can all have part of the street.\u201d * * * Detroit recycled I arrive at Detroit Metropolitan Airport with two heavy bags and instructions to try to get everywhere on foot, bike or public transport. The Motor City tore up its streetcar system in the 1950s; today it has no metro and no tram, apart from a short elevated loop serving a small central area. Construction is set to finish next year on a streetcar project to connect fast-regenerating Downtown with Midtown, but the three-mile M1 system won\u2019t reach into the hardest-hit neighbourhoods, or go anywhere near the airport. Ground transportation gets a pretty low-key show on the airport website, so I pick up a copy of Visit Detroit magazine, which has a welcome page from the Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation, Smart. The airport information page gives driving directions and explains the options for car rental (around $60 a day) and taxis ($50 Downtown). Smart itself runs a public bus service, but that doesn\u2019t even get a mention.     Detroit recently emerged from 18 months of bankruptcy. Photograph: Barry Lewis/Corbis via Getty    The Smart timetable online says a bus is due in 30 minutes \u2013 it shows up after an hour. The driver explains I\u2019ll have to change to a DDOT city bus to get Downtown; I pay my $2.25 and get on board with the three other passengers, all wearing the uniforms of airport fast-food concessions. As we pick up more people there are a lot of complaints about lateness; the bus driver takes pity on those who don\u2019t have enough money for a ticket and waves them through. I get off and change to the city bus system \u2013 another 30-minute wait in the dust and detritus beside a busy highway. It\u2019s three hours before I make the hotel.    We'll always be the Motor City. We don't have to lose our automotive soul  Maurice Cox     The issue briefly caught the attention of the international media last year when car worker James Robertson told how he walked 21 miles as part of his daily commute. Readers rallied round and raised $350,000. He bought a Ford Taurus and now drives to work in a fraction of the time. He also gained a lot of weight.  An estimated 40% of people living in the city don\u2019t have access to a car \u2013 that\u2019s 270,000 Detroiters. People who wait this long for a bus mostly don\u2019t have a choice.  * * * The next day sees Detroit\u2019s first ever Open Streets event. On a sunny Sunday afternoon, families, young people, old people, black, white, Latino, turn out on bikes to ride four miles of closed roads from Downtown, through the hipster haunt of Corktown to Mexicantown in the south-west. The route passes in front of the grand old Michigan Central Station, derelict since the last passenger train ran in 1988, killed by the car and intercity flights. Because times were so tough and no one wanted the land, historic structures like the station, the Packard factory, Fisher Body 21 and scores of others still stand \u2013 another of Detroit\u2019s problems has created a potential asset. Mayor Mike Duggan, the man who brought Cox in from New Orleans, makes an appearance. He tells me about 20-minute Neighbourhoods, a plan to regenerate areas in the neglected north of the city \u2013 from Six Mile to Eight Mile \u2013 so anyone can safely walk or cycle to shops, schools, the park or the library within 20 minutes, and enjoy a good quality of life without access to a car. Around 100 historic homes will be renovated, and blighted buildings that are not recoverable will be demolished. A new neighbourhood park and green cycleway will be created from unused land.     Mike Darga rides past the derelict Albert Kahn-designed Fisher Body 21 plant, where his father worked for 30 years. Darga gives auto heritage tours for Wheelhouse Detroit    Inspired by a visit from former New York transport commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan, Duggan authorised officials to use her experimental approach: forget time-consuming engineering risk assessments, put down some traffic cones and see what happens. The early signs from Fitzgerald \u2013 a neighbourhood which lost a large part of its population, and has the lowest rates of car ownership \u2013 are positive.    It\u2019s about the 40% in Detroit who don\u2019t have access to a car \u2026 and they have just as much right to mobility as drivers  Raquel Castaneda-Lopez     \u201cThis younger generation grew up in the back of their parents\u2019 cars being taken to school and to shops, and they don\u2019t want that any more,\u201d Duggan says. \u201cThey want to walk and cycle. We can\u2019t compete with the suburbs on their terms, but we can offer young people bikeable and walkable neighbourhoods, and that\u2019s at the heart of what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d Raquel Castaneda-Lopez, the city council member for District 6, sees mobility as a matter of human rights. A vibrant Latino community in her area was cut in two in the 1970s by the 18-lanes of the I-75 and I-96 highways. A pedestrian bridge now allows safe access, reuniting people on both sides.  \u201cWhen you design for the car you get divided cities,\u201d she says. \u201cRoads divide communities. For me it is about access to mobility, which is a human right. It\u2019s about the 40% in Detroit who don\u2019t have access to a car. These people need to get to the grocery store or school or work, and they have just as much right to mobility as drivers.\u201d     Detroit Bikes workers complete a contract for cycle share giant Citi Bike. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty    When Zak Pashak wanted to start making and selling an affordable bike from American steel, Detroit was his first choice. \u201cPeople here know how to make stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s steel work \u2013 it\u2019s welding, tooling, engineering and design \u2013 and then there\u2019s all the spinoff firms, the lawyers, the packing, the shipping \u2026 It makes sense.\u201d The former music promoter set up his Detroit Bikes factory in a west-side neighbourhood blighted by abandonment and crime. We get there past rows of overgrown, vacant lots and burnt-out houses left to slowly collapse.  Pashak has invested heavily in machinery to cut, bend, weld and paint steel tubes into finished bikes; hand-built frames hang in rows like carcasses at a butchers. He employs around 40 people \u2013 as many as he can locally \u2013 and hopes to expand that to 200.     The Dequindre Cut. Photograph: Pravin Sitaraman/Detroit Riverfront Conservancy    Tony Sheldon, a 46-year-old from Seven Mile, ran a welding machine team for American Axle until production was outsourced to China in 2008. He earns a fraction of what he used to make in the automotive industry but is happy here. \u201cThe auto industry was worth billions of dollars,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThe pay was better of course and the scale of the bike industry is much smaller \u2013 but that\u2019s over now. We can\u2019t do that any more, so that\u2019s it.\u201d Pashak hasn\u2019t turned a profit yet but believes bicycles could be a positive part of Detroit\u2019s future. \u201cIt\u2019s a $50bn a year industry globally but 99.5% of bikes are made in Asia, mostly China and Taiwan. If we can carve off even a little bit of that then it would have a big impact,\u201d he says. \u201cThe US bike industry has got a lot of potential. Bikes can be a great part of the economy of Detroit.\u201d  The city has been steadily reinventing itself since the riverside was renovated as part of the city\u2019s 300th anniversary in 2001. The city\u2019s flagship project, the Dequindre Cut, is a former rail line transformed into a paved path and cycle track. In a sign of the times, a luxury apartment building taking shape nearby is selling itself with promises of communal cycle parking alongside images of granite worktops and a pool.  The Detroit Greenways Coalition is working on extending the route into a 26-mile loop and the city\u2019s even getting a bike share next spring. Last month it sneaked into the top 50 of Bicycling magazine\u2019s Best Bike Cities of 2016 after census data pointed to a 400% increase in ridership since 2000. Todd Scott, executive director of the Greenways Coalition, says cycling in Detroit is more successful now than any time since the 1890s, when Henry Ford built his first car, the Quadricycle, from bike parts and rode to his factory on two wheels. \u201cRight now the city can remove a parking lane if it wants, give the space over to cycling, and know no one\u2019s going to make an angry call to their local councilman,\u201d he says. \u201cVacant lots don\u2019t complain.\u201d     Elevated highways in front of the Houston skyline. Bayous pass underneath, creating freeways for the city\u2019s cyclists. Photograph: Alamy    Houston, we have a solution I fly into Houston and follow signs to the public bus stop. Again I\u2019m the only passenger not wearing a worker\u2019s uniform. The bus takes the scenic route to the shiny glass and steel centre of America\u2019s oil capital but it\u2019s comfortable, smells strongly of cleaning products and \u2013 compared with $50 for a taxi \u2013 is a bargain at just $1.25.  Like Detroit, cars are hardwired into the fabric of the city: the addiction is structural, not just cultural. Houston is laced with wide ribbons of asphalt, but many here are elevated on towering concrete columns, and at rush hour when I arrive the freeways look like parking lots. Unlike Detroit, this habitual boomtown is growing fast. It is forecast to overtake Chicago to become the third largest city in the US and can lay claim to be one of America\u2019s capitals of sprawl. Houston, though, is also the nation\u2019s most racially and ethnically diverse metropolitan area and, as waves of new residents arrive, they bring ideas \u2013 like expecting to be able to get around on foot, bike and transit.  Houston has tripled the size of its Metro light rail over the past few years, and opened two new lines. There\u2019s a new bike share system which has just gained approval for a threefold expansion, taking it out to the Medical Center and Texas Southern University. And the city looks set to approve its first Bike Plan for more than two decades. New mayor Sylvester Turner has called for a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d in how Houston gets around, stressing that the city can\u2019t solve its congestion problems simply by building more roads.    The whole American dream \u2013 that you can live in the suburbs, drive a nice car, get around easily \u2013 that\u2019s just not true  Mary Blitzer     \u201cWe have been the poster child for car-centric poor planning for so long,\u201d says Carter Stern, chief executive of the B-Cycle bike share scheme, \u201cbut now we\u2019ve got all these people coming from outside the city with new ideas and they really expect to be able to walk around, to cycle, to enjoy being outside in public space. Houston was behind but things have started coming together \u2026 It is going to change the way Houstonians view their city.\u201d Then there are the bayous: slow-moving streams which cut right into the heart of Houston. Transformed into linear parks by previous mayor Annise Parker and millions of private money, these flood facilities offer spectacular green spaces in the shadow of Downtown skyscrapers. They are popular at weekends but \u2013 with better connections to the varied neighbourhoods they pass through \u2013 could better act as freeways for bikes, delivering cycle commuters safely to the centre of the city. Houston is even walkable in small, isolated pockets. Forget the fake urbanism of City Centre, a swanky development of strollable shops, cafes and restaurants on the edge of town which can only be reached via vast multi-lane freeways and is as good as inaccessible on public transport. Areas like Rice Village \u2013 built in the 1930s before the trolley system was torn up \u2013 are great to get around on foot. If you\u2019re lucky enough to live in Midtown, Montrose or West U, their quieter tree-lined side streets are perfectly pleasant places to walk and cycle. It\u2019s just that not many people do.     Suburbs near Houston \u2026 the Texan city is one of America\u2019s capitals of sprawl. Photograph: David R Frazier Photolibrary/Alamy    The city is not without its challenges, though. The Downtown area is crisscrossed by a grid of four- and five-lane one-way streets. The cars are big and people drive fast. Oversized SUVs called Silverado, Denali and Tundra are popular \u2013 names chosen to inspire adventure in the minds of their drivers, but whose approaching roar raises the heart rates of people crossing or cycling for all the wrong reasons. Within a couple of blocks of where I\u2019m staying are four large, surface-level parking lots and three multi-storey car parks. If you park on the 10th floor it can take 20 minutes just to get out at the end of the day.    The typical cycling experience involves 20 minutes where it\u2019s fine and then five minutes of terror  Patrick Walsh     Mary Blitzer, advocacy director of Bike Houston, tells me that outside the loop formed by the I-610 freeway, it gets harder to walk or cycle. People tend to live on small suburban streets which lead nowhere except a six-lane arterial highway. \u201cThis is Texas and people love their big cars. They drive fast and they don\u2019t like to stop for pedestrians,\u201d she says. \u201cHouston has a terrible traffic problem. The whole American dream \u2013 that you can live in the suburbs and drive a nice car and get around easily \u2013 that\u2019s just not true. It\u2019s a pain in the ass to get around this city by car. \u201cI don\u2019t think most people want to be sitting in traffic jams, though, and we need to give them options. People will choose to walk, cycle or ride public transport if it\u2019s easy and it\u2019s comfortable \u2013 but they\u2019re not going to choose the miserable option.\u201d Houston is richer than Detroit, but an estimated 33% of its population don\u2019t have access to a car. State senator Rodney Ellis, a long-time cycle advocate, represents some of the wealthiest and some of the poorest areas in the city. As he takes me on a ride round some of Houston\u2019s historically black neighbourhoods, an impatient driver blasts his horn behind us and close passes at speed. It\u2019s the only bit of road rage I witness in three days cycling in the city.  \u201cPeople think this road belongs to cars,\u201d Ellis says. \u201cBut that\u2019s changing. If you get more people out riding bikes, that will change further \u2013 but to get more people cycling, you need safe infrastructure.\u201d Many people cycle here without lights late at night or early in the morning, as they make their way to and from poorly paid jobs. There are a lot of deaths and many are not investigated. Cyclists make up 0.8% of commuter journeys in Houston, but account for 2.5% of traffic casualties \u2013 a disproportionately high number which does not even take account of these \u201cinvisible cyclists\u201d.     State senator Rodney Ellis cycling in Houston. Photograph: Nick Van Mead    Houston\u2019s planning director, Patrick Walsh, admits the city\u2019s existing cycle infrastructure is below or at minimum standard, and that \u201cthe typical cycling experience involves 20 minutes where it\u2019s fine and then five minutes of terror. It is the most challenging part of the ride that stops people from trying it.\u201d However, the adoption of a Complete Streets programme has institutionalised the consideration of pedestrians, cyclists and public transport when new roads are constructed or existing ones remodelled. The city is also altering development regulations to reduce the emphasis on parking and allow it to design streets which make it harder for drivers to speed.  But change will not come fast. \u201cI think in 20 years you\u2019ll see an incredible transformation in places like Midtown,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cWe\u2019ll have lively places where people want to walk out to have dinner, or get to work \u2013 but we are not there yet. At some point we are going to have to make choices about how people get around, but it has to be incremental. \u201cIf we tried to change overnight, we would have push-back. Cars are going to remain the primary mode of transportation for a while.\u201d     Rush hour on Hollywood Boulevard. Photograph: Alamy    Nobody walks in LA Silver Lake has a reputation as one of LA\u2019s most walkable areas, but that\u2019s really not saying a lot. Deborah Murphy of Los Angeles Walks meets me at the farmer\u2019s market off Sunset Boulevard.  The roar of traffic is a constant accompaniment and, as we wait to cross the six lanes of Sunset, a woman in her 80s with a walker starts her journey from the other side. At peak hours the queues of drivers behind their metal and glass is endless, and outside rush hour cars shoot by at 40 or 50mph. The woman is not even halfway across when the countdown warning starts, and she\u2019s still on the road when the first cars accelerate away. She makes it to safety, visibly relieved, but if her husband hadn\u2019t been on hand to help her up the kerb, she would have been stuck. The elderly \u2013 and children walking to school \u2013 account for disproportionately high numbers of those killed and seriously injured on LA\u2019s streets. Almost 200 people a year are killed in traffic crashes in the city and 33% are pedestrians (even though journeys by foot make up only 18% of trips). Cars are the leading cause of death for two to 14-year-olds. The area has made some improvements: the triangle where the market takes place was closed to traffic in 2011, and a number of crosswalks were painted after a brace of deaths. A mural depicts Danny, the triangle\u2019s unofficial homeless caretaker, who was knocked down and killed crossing to the 99 cent store.     Primary mode of transport in Los Angeles County (left), and those killed or seriously injured in road crashes (right). Illustration: LA Vision Zero    Murphy points out the problems that make it hard for people to get around on foot: signposts bisecting the narrow sidewalk which make it impassable to wheelchairs and buggies; smashed and wildly uneven paving slabs; 40-ft high streetlamps which only light the road; non-existent crossings where pedestrians should have legal right of way; dropdowns which force vulnerable people into the path of oncoming traffic \u2026 It\u2019s a long list. LA\u2019s adoption of Vision Zero, and a new Mobility Plan, aim to change that. Sunset Boulevard is one of a number of streets set to get redesigned with wider sidewalks, protected bike lanes and slower traffic. A year ago the junction at Hollywood and Highland \u2013 where one pedestrian a month was being killed or seriously injured \u2013 was turned into a Tokyo-style scramble crossroads. There have been no serious injuries since. It\u2019s not just on sidewalks that this most car-centric of all cities is making changes. LA Metro is working on the largest rail infrastructure project in the country: two major extensions opened this year \u2013 on the Gold Line in San Gabriel valley and the Expo Line to Santa Monica \u2013 and three more are under construction, including a connector to Los Angeles international airport. The city built its first protected bike lanes last year, with six more set for the next six months \u2013 and a bike share system started operation Downtown this summer.  And as Americans go to the polls on Tuesday to choose a new president, voters in Los Angeles County will also vote on Measure M \u2013 a half-cent sales tax raising $860m a year for transportation projects. If it gets the two-thirds majority it needs, then this vast, polycentric metropolis could be transformed over the next 40 years with a whole host of new highway, metro, light rail, streetcar, BRT, cycling and walking projects.

Photograph: Jon Hicks/Getty Images    I see more people on bikes in Los Angeles than in Houston and Detroit combined \u2013 but riding the busy streets among trucks, SUVs and fast-moving cars reminds me too much of London. I\u2019d rate it the least cycle-friendly of the three. In the past year, protected bike lanes have been created on Reseda, Los Angeles Street, and along the side of the Expo Line to Santa Monica. Facilities like that \u2013 and safe cycle paths running along the LA River and the beach \u2013 are great, but existing bike paths elsewhere are painted lanes or sharrows. Even the colour of paint is an issue, with the city still fighting battles against Hollywood film makers, who complain that bright green bike lanes \u201cruin the shot\u201d. Despite the lack of safe infrastructure, the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition says cycling\u2019s commute share rose from 0.7% to 1.3% between 2010 and 2013. That fell back to 1.2% last year, but the LACBC is optimistic that new protected lanes in the pipeline will boost figures further.    I see Ciclavia events as like a gateway drug for cycling  Joe Linton     \u201cIf this is the number of people cycling without very good infrastructure, then you will really see that jump when we have better lanes,\u201d says executive director Tamika Butler. \u201cWhen you ask people why they don\u2019t bike, their number one issue is safety. When you make it safer the demand will be huge.\u201d Joe Linton, editor of LA Streetsblog, thinks the city is only just catching up with how groups of Angelenos have been using their streets for years. \u201cPeople have walked and biked in LA for 100 years and more,\u201d he says. \u201cBiking and walking took an upturn in the 1980s and 90s, but the city didn\u2019t notice and kept planning for cars. The backlash led to the last bike plan but the city is still waking up from this \u2018we only need to think about cars\u2019 hangover and is still more car-oriented than not.\u201d Linton welcomes safe bike lanes and new metro lines \u2013 and describes the city\u2019s hugely popular CicLAvia events as like a \u201cgateway drug\u201d for cycling \u2013 but two decades-plus of campaigning has left him frustrated at the pace of progress. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a hundred reasons we keep building for cars,\u201d he explains. \u201cTransport laws, state and federal regulations and standards, parking requirements \u2026 We\u2019ve fought back and got rid of maybe 20 of these, but we are still behind. It\u2019s like we\u2019ve cracked the windshield, but we haven\u2019t broken through.\u201d     A freeway in Los Angeles, where almost 80% of journeys are made by car. Photograph: Alamy    I hop on a 704 Rapid Line bus downtown to meet Seleta Reynolds, the city\u2019s head of transportation. The day before I was waiting to get off the same bus when a woman tapped me on the shoulder and handed me the wad of $20s that had slipped out of my pocket on to the seat.  Today the bus is full of people, mostly Latino, reading books, checking their phones, chatting, sleeping \u2026 There are also a significant number of people in their 20s and early 30s \u2013 the millennial generation I\u2019ve seen all week on the Expo and Red metro lines, who seem to feel driving interferes with smartphone screen time. \u201cThere are hundreds of thousands of people in LA who have to get around without a car,\u201d says Reynolds, as we survey the city\u2019s latest protected bike lane on Los Angeles Street from her office on the 10th floor of Thom Mayne\u2019s futuristic \u201cdeath star\u201d building. It boasts cycle-specific lights and floating bus stops.    I don\u2019t know that people really love driving in LA any more  Seleta Reynolds     There has been a fall across the board in the number of Americans holding driving licences, but the shift has been most marked among young people. As Deborah Murphy jokes, a few years ago non-drivers were considered \u201ccar-less\u201d, now they\u2019re \u201ccar-free\u201d. Reynolds is keen to stress there is \u201cdefinitely not a war on cars\u201d, but she says the reconstruction of the 405 freeway \u2013 and the much-feared threat of \u201cCarmageddon\u201d \u2013 taught Los Angeles that it cannot simply build itself out of congestion. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge latent demand for road space which shows up if you increase capacity,\u201d she says. \u201cNow the 405\u2019s finished, the traffic is just as bad as it was before.\u201d  That lesson has long been learnt in Europe, where increasing numbers of urban planners are focusing on efforts to reduce the space given over to individual motor vehicles and talk is of the first steps towards truly car-free cities.  The fact is, though, that Los Angeles remains the most congested city in North America. Maybe it\u2019s like the scene in LA Story, I suggest, where Steve Martin climbs into his car to drive next door. Is it a city which \u2013 despite the deaths, the air pollution and all that time wasted in traffic jams \u2013 is so addicted to the car that it could never change?   Related: End of the car age: how cities are outgrowing the automobile    Unlike other city officials I\u2019ve met on this trip, Reynolds at least acknowledges the existence of a \u201cstick\u201d \u2013 in the form of more expensive parking, and perhaps even a congestion charge one day \u2013 alongside the carrot (better transit and safer facilities for walking and cycling). \u201cTo reduce the number of single-occupancy vehicles, for example, research shows carrots can cut that by 7 or 8%, but sticks can have a 30% effect. We need the carrot and the stick. It\u2019s a question of providing good options but having some really good public policy discussions about the stick \u2026 and that\u2019s tricky.\u201d All three cities are taking some impressive measures to encourage walking, cycling and public transport \u2013 from Detroit\u2019s land grabs and protected bike lanes, to Houston\u2019s bayou conversions, and LA\u2019s metro extensions \u2013 but this is the first time I\u2019ve heard \u201cthe stick\u201d mentioned.  If this sprawling shrine to freeways that look like parking lots is even considering what it would take to push people out of cars \u2013 could there yet be hope for the rest of America\u2019s cities? \u201cThe truth is,\u201d says Reynolds, \u201cI don\u2019t know that people really love driving in LA any more.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion  "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/06/troll-armies-social-media-trump-russian", "publicationDate": "2016-11-06T14:00:17Z", "tags": ["Social media", "Digital media", "Internet", "Twitter", "Technology", "China", "Russia", "UK news", "Media"], "sentences": ["Favourite subjects Excellent local facilities, why democracy doesn\u2019t work, Taiwan."], "title": "Invasion of the troll armies: \u2018Social media where the war goes on\u2019", "article": "We don\u2019t know who they are, or what their mission is.

In 2011 the PR firm Bell Pottinger told undercover journalists that they could \u201ccreate and maintain third-party blogs\u201d, and spruce up Wikipedia profiles and Google search rankings. Indeed marketing has a rich history of so-called \u201castroturfing\u201d, which is laying down fake grassroots. Take Forest, \u201cthe voice and friend of the smoker\u201d, which at least admits in nearly invisible small print that it is paid for by the tobacco industry. Now, however, manipulating social media has become part of the business of government. It may yet influence how governments are formed. Recent reports suggest that many of Donald Trump\u2019s most fervent online supporters are not themselves Americans, but Russians being paid by their government to help him win. One told Samantha Bee that she pretends to be a housewife from Nebraska. Why she would confess it now is unexplained, but when you look around it begins to feel like everybody does it. It\u2019s just that no two countries\u2019 methods are the same.  China The existence of the wumao dang or \u201c50 Cent Party\u201d is not a secret in China, but then it is hard to employ up to two million people secretly. Even the state-owned Global Times reported with approval on the practice in 2010, citing Changsha\u2019s party office as the source of the name after it paid a team of commenters 600 yuan a month in 2004, plus half a yuan \u2013 hence \u201c50 cent\u201d \u2013 for each glowing post they made. Since then, paying stooges to praise your work online has become about as routine for local government in China as hiring traffic wardens. A recent study at Harvard University found that the Chinese authorities were placing 448m phony comments on the internet each year. In an analysis of 43,800 pro-regime comments, the researchers concluded that 99.3% of them were made by civil servants from a wide variety of government departments. The postings tended to come in bursts at testing times, such as during protests or party meetings. Interestingly, few of the comments qualify as trolling, in the strict sense. Rather than attacking unbelievers, they focus on swamping the doubters with a flood of positive messages, or cleverly diverting the conversation. As with any job, some practitioners are laughably bad at it. In January 2014, quartz.com found many stooges simply cutting and pasting a suggested question into an online discussion with a party secretary in Ganzhou. \u201cIt seems like taxis are far more orderly than in past years,\u201d they all wanted to tell him. Two years before, however, Ai Weiwei interviewed an anonymous 26-year-old with very sophisticated methods. The young man, whose own family knew nothing of his work, estimated that 10-20% of the comments he saw were left by the 50 Cent Party. He described creating several identities in one forum, and structuring arguments between them so that the most authoritative voice could ultimately settle matters in the government\u2019s favour. Another tactic was to be deliberately provocative, and thus draw public anger on to himself and away from the authorities. \u201cSometimes I feel like I have a split personality,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I like it or hate it.

Illustration: Joe Magee     Russia Long before Donald Trump met Twitter, Russia was famous for its troll factories \u2013 outside Russia, anyway. Allegations of covert propagandists invading chatrooms go back as far as 2003, and in 2012 the Kremlin-backed youth movement Nashi was revealed to be paying people to comment on blogs. However most of what we know now comes from a series of leaks in 2013 and 2014, most concerning a St Petersburg company called Internet Research Agency, then just \u201cInternet Research\u201d. It is believed to be one of several firms where trolls are trained and paid to smear Putin\u2019s opponents both at home and internationally.   Related: Salutin' Putin: inside a Russian troll house    According to internal documents released by a group of hackers in 2013, Internet Research Agency employed more than 600 people across Russia, and had an implied annual budget of $10m \u2013 half of which was paid out in cash. Employees were expected to post on news articles 50 times a day. Those who wrote blogs had to maintain six Facebook accounts and publish at least three posts daily. On Twitter, they had to have at least 10 accounts, on which they would tweet 50 times. All had targets for the number of followers and the level of engagement they had to reach. Later, an investigator called Lyudmila Savchuk went undercover at the company and afterwards published her experiences. These included smearing the character of the opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in the days following his murder, and promoting the theory that he was killed by his own friends, rather than by friends of Putin. \u201cI felt the bullets between my own shoulders,\u201d Savchuk said. \u201cI was so upset that I almost gave myself away. But I was 007. I fulfilled my task.\u201d When a Finnish reporter called Jessikka Aro wrote about Internet Research in 2014, she herself became the target of a frightening campaign of threats and smears. As you might expect, many Russian trolls lack a certain polish when posting in English. \u201cI think the whole world is realizing what will be with Ukraine, and only US keep on fuck around because of their great plans are doomed to failure,\u201d one Internet Research employee wrote on a forum. Indeed the Guardian\u2019s own moderators have begun to notice regular clues, especially on articles about Ukraine. \u201cWe can look at the suspicious tone of certain users, combined with the date they signed up, the time they post and the subjects they post on,\u201d says one senior moderator. \u201cZealous pro-separatist comments in broken English claiming to be from western counties are very common.\u201d Estimated troops Several thousand. Favourite subjects Putin and Trump being great, the opposition being corrupt, the Nato conspiracy against Russia, the effeminacy of Barack Obama.  Israel There\u2019s been an Israeli public relations war for about as long as there\u2019s been an Israel. In Hebrew it\u2019s called \u201chasbara\u201d, literally meaning \u201cexplanation\u201d, and it involves trying to improve the world\u2019s opinion of the country and its causes. Accordingly there are around 350 official Israeli online channels, covering the full range of social media. For instance, besides its well-known Twitter accounts in English, Hebrew and Arabic, the Israeli Defence Force even has its own Pinterest page, featuring photo collections with themes such as \u201cSoldiers\u2019 Stories\u201d and \u201cIDF Style\u201d. In 2013, the Israeli government revealed that it would also recruit \u201ccovert units\u201d however. These would be staffed by a mixture of international supporters and domestic students, whose high intelligence, low income and familiarity with social media make them generally well suited to professional trolling. \u201cWe need a unified effort to explain why we have a legal right to be here in Israel,\u201d the Knesset member Dov Lipman told the Jerusalem Post. \u201cThat is key to defeat the movements pushing to boycott, divest and sanction Israel.\u201d Those who signed up would get quick access to government information, and leaders of student groups would also be awarded scholarships. Sure enough, during the war in Gaza the following summer, a student group called Israel Under Fire emerged as one of many voices promoting the Israeli side of the story. \u201cWe counter Palestinian propaganda and explain the Israeli perspective,\u201d the group\u2019s leader, Yarden Ben-Yosef, said. \u201cSocial media is another place where the war goes on. This is another way to tell our story.\u201d We do not know whether Israel Under Fire was itself one of these covert units, or whether Ben-Yosef got a scholarship. The group\u2019s Facebook Page is still active today. Estimated troops Low thousands. Favourite subjects Palestinian brainwashing, friendliness of Israeli troops, justifiedness of Israeli force.  Ukraine If Russia has a troll army, why shouldn\u2019t Ukraine? With this logic, last February, the country\u2019s new Information Policy Ministry announced the launch of its own i-army, based at i-army.org, with plans to challenge the enemy version of events on social media. \u201cI already said more than once that we should effectively combat Russian bots and fake information,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s information policy minister Yuriy Stets said. \u201cI think this project will give us many volunteers who are ready to disseminate truthful information and expose fake reports from Russia.\u201d     Illustration: Joe Magee    It is not clear how many Ukrainians or Ukraine supporters have yet taken up the cause. The i-army.org site itself, where volunteers can join, is certainly not very appealing to outsiders. It is a crazed and relentless jumble of unflattering stories about Russia \u2013 from details about the MH17 air crash, to doping by its athletes, to unsubstantiated allegations from the western media that Putin is a paedophile. \u201cDo not let yourself be deceived \u2013 spread the truth!\u201d the site says, rousingly. More obvious signs of life can be found on the i-army\u2019s Twitter page. This is very active, with 12,800 followers, which isn\u2019t bad, and retweets regularly runs into dozens or hundreds. Clearly some of its followers have been arguing Ukraine\u2019s case online, but the tweets themselves are not very persuasive, offering photographs of captured Russian military hardware, dry political statements and sudden comic memes about Russia\u2019s federal reserves, for example. The account\u2019s wallpaper perhaps tells you everything you need to know about the Information Policy Ministry \u2013 or the \u201cMinistry of Truth\u201d, as some Ukrainian wags prefer. It depicts a group of noble white knights carrying the ministry\u2019s logo into battle against, literally, an army of fantastical trolls (who rather incongruously carry the logos of RT television and Russia 24). No matter how sympathetic one might feel towards the Ukrainian cause, it is hard not to feel that this particular region of the conflict needs a lighter touch. Estimated troops A few hundred. Favourite subjects Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.  UK The so-called \u201cTwitter Troops\u201d of the 77th Brigade were somewhat misunderstood by the media when the new army unit was created last year. In fact social media was just one example of many non-military skills that the specialist soldiers were intended to bring to the army. And in any case, the MoD informs me, it would not be a soldier\u2019s job to launch a disinformation campaign on the battlefield, even if they had the time. You don\u2019t hear much about JTRIG in Britain, however, and they do just this kind of thing. Indeed the very existence of the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group was a national secret until documents from Edward Snowden were published by Glenn Greenwald and Andrew Fishman in 2014. And they reveal a very busy group of people, whose work within GCHQ was intended to help everyone from the police and MI5 to the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Bank of England. Some of JTRIG\u2019s tactics, such as hacking into websites and setting up sexual \u201choneypot\u201d stings, sound more or less like conventional spying. Others were carefully designed to manipulate and deceive. In the words of the leaked document, these included \u201cUploading YouTube videos containing persuasive messages; establishing online aliases with Facebook and Twitter accounts, blogs and forum memberships \u2026 sending spoof emails and text messages as well as providing spoof online resources; and setting up spoof trade sites.\u201d Some of this sounds reasonable, and frankly welcome, such as disrupting the online activities of terrorists or child abusers. Indeed, if it still exists, JTRIG seems to target specific groups or individuals, rather than trying to influence public opinion. Which groups, however, and who chooses them, might be a legitimate concern. The document mentions the English Defence League, for example, whose members were no doubt not happy to be included. For its part, GCHQ will only say that all its work is legal. Estimated troops A few dozen. Favourite subjects Sex, drugs, not travelling to Syria please.  North Korea, South Korea Most North Koreans\u2019 experience of social media is none at all, unless they have been given an illicit glimpse by a foreigner or a government official. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are all officially blocked, just in case. Domestically, there is thus no online opinion for the regime to bother about controlling. (Unless they launch their own version of Facebook, as some believe they plan to.) Across the border, however, just about all South Koreans have smartphones, KakaoTalk and the fastest internet in the world. They also have about 200 North Korean trolls to contend with, according to a report published by a South Korean think-tank, the Police Policy Institute, in 2013. In total the report estimated that North Korean agents had posted 41,373 pieces of propaganda in 2012. (That\u2019s about one every two days per agent, which is hardly Stakhanovite.)     Illustration: Joe Magee    Given the extreme strangeness of the regime in Pyongyang, it is easy to presume that they would not know how to talk to a sophisticated southern audience. In fact their approach, as revealed in the report, is rather clever. Instead of hammering people with outlandish and unconvincing Juche propaganda in the usual North Korean way, Pyongyang\u2019s trolls focus on areas that are still debated in the south \u2013 such as whether to give southerners access to sites (currently blocked) that praise the northern regime. Aware that recently started accounts with little background often arouse suspicion, northern agents also tend to work behind identities stolen from real southern users. Clearly the problem has been serious enough for South Korea to react, and indeed to overreact. For years the country\u2019s National Intelligence Service has been routinely posting messages of its own to attack those coming from the north, and at times these have allegedly strayed into attacks on South Korea\u2019s own opposition parties. Last year the country\u2019s former intelligence chief Won Sei-hoon was convicted of trying to influence the outcome of the 2012 presidential election in favour of the incumbent Park Geun-hye. A retrial has since been ordered, but in the original Won was alleged to be running a team of nine agents who used at least 658 Twitter identities to post many thousands of messages to discredit the north \u2013 and also, in the case of 274,800 messages, to smear President Park\u2019s opponents, who were described as, among other things, \u201cleftist followers of North Korea\u201d. Estimated troops 200 (north) 9 (south). Favourite subject Whether North Korea is a) paradise b) paranoid.  Turkey President Erdo\u011fan was taught a lesson by the Gezi Park protests of 2013. Not, unfortunately, that Turks should be allowed to live more freely, but that he should take control of social media, with which they had organised themselves against him. By the end of the summer, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) had begun recruiting a team of 6,000 social media operatives. \u201cWe aim at developing a positive political language which we are teaching to our volunteers,\u201d a party official told the Wall Street Journal at the time. \u201cAnd when the opposing camp spreads disinformation about the party, we correct them with valid information, always using positive language.\u201d But not always being open about it. When asked to name some of the people who would be correcting this misinformation, the official declined. Sadly for Erdo\u011fan and the AKP, their new army of volunteers proved overenthusiastic and, let\u2019s say, under-subtle. In the months that followed it became common for those who even mildly criticised the government to be showered with far from positive remarks. Often the abuse arrived in bursts, from people with not very convincing profiles, making accusations that were not only bizarre but bizarrely similar. For instance when the journalist Emre Kizilkaya criticised the government\u2019s handling of a hostage negotiation in October, he found himself repeatedly accused of \u201cZionism\u201d. At times the \u201cAK Trolls\u201d, as they became known, spread false stories. In July 2014, it was reported that they started a fake Twitter account supposedly from the musician Erkan Ogur, used it to tweet controversial comments about the state intelligence services, then complained about \u201chis\u201d tweets to the AKP authorities in Sakarya, who promptly cancelled Ogur\u2019s forthcoming concert there. Later, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s own daughter Sumeyye was apparently recorded asking one of his advisers for help from \u201cour trolls\u201d. When recordings allegedly showing Erdo\u011fan\u2019s own corruption began to spread on Twitter in the spring of 2014, he simply (but not very effectively) shut Twitter down. Perhaps aware that this Putinesque farce wasn\u2019t making the AKP more popular, the party changed tack just before the general elections last spring, launching the New Turkey Digital Office, which would henceforth dish out more conventional online propaganda. \u201cAll of our accounts will be officially announced,\u201d spokesman Besir Atalay told the Turkish media. \u201cOur messages will be determined at the party headquarters. None of the other accounts would be related to us, including those ones [the trolls].\u201d Nevertheless the AKP lost its majority in the elections. Then regained it in new elections later in the year. Estimated troops Formerly 6,000, probably still 6,000.

But many, both within the city and overseas, fear those liberties have been eroded in recent years. \u201cAs Hong Kong residents grapple with continued encroachments by Beijing, the future of free expression on the island and its status as the regional publishing hub is in question,\u201d said Suzanne Nossel, Executive Director of PEN America.  \u201cThe government of Hong Kong must act decisively, now, to buttress the rule of law and the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 framework that protects creative freedom and has allowed Hong Kong to serve as such a vibrant commercial center.\u201d Of the 16 bookstores that sold politically sensitive material at Hong Kong\u2019s airport, a key point for curious mainland Chinese to purchase titles critical of Communist leaders, 11 have shut in the past year. Book stores specialising in political material in downtown Hong Kong also saw a raft of closings. Yu Jie, an exiled writer and democracy activist, had one of his books shelved by a publisher that had previously released his work. He approached several other outlets, all of whom turned him down, alluding to the disappearances. \u201cOne publisher told me that his relatives told him they didn\u2019t want him to be a second Lee Bo,\u201d Yu said of his efforts. Earlier this year at the Hong Kong book fair, the premiere event in the city\u2019s literary calendar, there was a notable decline of stalls carrying political and \u2018banned\u201d works. While titles that cannot find a Hong Kong publisher are usually still released in nearby Taiwan, publishers there complained that very few in Hong Kong are willing to distribute the books, the report said.  PEN America decried the weak response from the Hong Kong authorities and the British and Swedish governments for not doing enough to protect their citizens, accusing the international community of prioritising business ties over human rights. \u201cThere are other incentives for governments to downplay Chinese abuses, including, above all, the desire to maintain beneficial trade and economic relationships,\u201d the report said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/us-global-threats-transition-next-president", "publicationDate": "2016-11-07T05:00:36Z", "tags": ["US elections 2016", "US news", "Russia", "China", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "Europe", "US foreign policy", "US politics", "World news"], "sentences": ["Beijing is also squeezing Taiwan, whose new government its dislikes and whose de facto independence is underwritten by the US."], "title": "US faces host of global threats during transition until next president", "article": "Sharks are circling as the US prepares to vote, on the lookout for signs of American weakness and indecision around the world during the months-long transition period until the next president is firmly established in the White House. Call it a window of vulnerability. No matter whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump wins on Tuesday, Barack Obama bequeaths a world fraught with danger. From Asia to the Middle East and eastern Europe, governments and forces hostile to US and the west may try to exploit America\u2019s power vacuum.  The problem is not new. Unlike in Britain, the US constitution does not allow a quick handover. Clinton or Trump will be sworn in at noon on 20 January 2017. Until then Obama remains in office, but as a \u201clame duck\u201d president his wishes are increasingly irrelevant. Once installed, it can still take months for the new incumbent to establish his or her authority and complete thousands of appointments. The most important, such as national security adviser and the secretaries of defence and state, must be confirmed by Congress. This can be a contentious, lengthy process. The most disastrous transition was probably in 1860-61 between James Buchanan and his successor, Abraham Lincoln. During the interregnum, seven states seceded from the Union. When Lincoln came to office, he found the civil war already under way.  Modern-day threats are mostly external (although some Trump supporters warn of domestic insurrection if he loses). North Korea is one of the most pressing. The dictatorship in Pyongyang has recklessly escalated its nuclear weapons programme in recent months.  North Korea\u2019s latest provocations include the testing of a submarine-launched ballistic missile capable, in theory, of attacking the western US. The isolated regime has ignored stepped-up UN sanctions and is hardening its stance, determined to prove it is a force to be reckoned with.  Political upheavals in South Korea, where the president faces pressure to resign, a tougher military posture adopted by Shinzo Abe\u2019s rightwing government in Japan, and the reluctance of China to crack down on its renegade ally add to a sense of growing instability.   If Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s unpredictable leader, senses uncertainty in Washington, he may be tempted to fire a shot, literally or metaphorically, across the greenhorn president\u2019s bows \u2013 with incalculable consequences.  China faces similar temptations. It has been sparring with the US navy in the South China Sea, where its expansionist maritime claims and island-building have been ruled illegal by a UN court. Beijing is also squeezing Taiwan, whose new government its dislikes and whose de facto independence is underwritten by the US.   Does Xi Jinping, China\u2019s all-powerful president, calculate he can use American distraction to his advantage? Some analysts suggest Xi would welcome a Trump presidency, because he and Trump think alike about national interest. Or maybe, scarily, he takes Trump for a fool he can bamboozle.  Such considerations also loom large in the Middle East, where Russia seems intent on helping the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad win the civil war before the next American president has a chance to change Obama\u2019s hands-off policy or impose peace terms.   In lawless Libya, where UN efforts to foster a unity government are failing, more nasty surprises may be in store. If Islamic State is evicted from Raqqah and Mosul, Libya may become its new centre of operations. The Yemen conflict, involving Iran and Saudi Arabia, is another powder keg.  Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s leader, could also use the US power vacuum to consolidate or advance Moscow\u2019s interests, as defined by the Kremlin, in Ukraine and the Baltic region, where tensions are already high.   How would Nato respond, for example, to increased Russian military activity and cyber warfare along the border with Estonia or Latvia? The alliance would, as usual, look to Washington for a lead. But one might not be forthcoming.  Trump regularly disparages Nato, suggesting he may cut US support, and like other macho men such as actor Steven Seagal, appears to admire Putin. For her part, Clinton would be loth to begin her new presidency with an old-style superpower confrontation.   On top of all that, as the US transition looms, there are, as Donald Rumsfeld said, the \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d. If an unexpected, unforeseen international crisis suddenly arises, the American security safety net will be more full of holes than usual."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-new-us-president-america-global-economy-china-mexico", "publicationDate": "2016-11-09T16:36:23Z", "tags": ["Global economy", "Donald Trump", "Economics", "Business", "US news", "World news", "US elections 2016", "US politics"], "sentences": ["There will be no TPP under a Trump presidency and all the signs are that countries such as South Korea and Taiwan will be subject to the same protectionist strictures as Mexico and China."], "title": "How America's new president will affect the global economy", "article": "Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential elections will have implications for the whole global economy. Mexico     A Mexican man reads a paper emblazoned with news on Donald Trump. Photograph: AFP/Getty    America\u2019s neighbour to the south has most to lose from the new Republican president. Trump\u2019s message to blue-collar voters in the rust-belt states was that US manufacturing jobs have migrated across the Rio Grande as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement signed by Bill Clinton in the early 1990s. Trump has said that if he cannot renegotiate Nafta he will pull out of the free trade deal altogether. He has threatened to put a 35% tariff on some Mexican goods and pledged to close the \u201csweatshops in Mexico that undercut American workers\u201d. In addition, he has said he would round up and send home up illegal immigrants living and working in America, 5 million of whom are thought to be Mexican. If implemented in full, the impact on the Mexican economy of these policies would be profound. Trade between the US and Mexico would slow, factories would close, foreign direct investment flows would dry up and millions of repatriated workers would have to be absorbed into the Mexican workforce. US consumers would see the price of some goods rise. Mexico is not the only central American country at risk. Claudia Calich, fund manager at the M&amp;G emerging market bond fund, says remittances from people working illegally in the US are worth 5.6%, 8% and 13.2% of GDP to the economies of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras respectively.  China     Zheng Gao, from Shanghai, China, takes a picture of the front page of a newspaper featuring Donald Trump. Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP    Some of Trump\u2019s economic manifesto has been hazy but his attitude to China could not have been clearer. He will instruct his Treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator, he will bring cases against Beijing to the World Trade Organisation, and he will consider imposing a 45% tariff on Chinese imports into the US to make it easier for American companies to compete. The US is the biggest single market for Chinese exports, accounting for about 20% of the total. There would be a risk that aggressive US trade policy could result in a marked slowdown in China\u2019s growth and a loss of manufacturing jobs. Faced with that possibility, Beijing would have two choices. It might take an emollient line, promising to increase direct investment into the US as a way of supporting Trump\u2019s attempt to rebuild the American economy. More likely, though, China would adopt an aggressive, nationalistic stance. Beijing is not without economic weapons, since it has amassed a vast stock of US Treasury bonds in recent years, the proceeds of its trade surplus with America. Beijing could meet Trump\u2019s threat with one of its own: to dump US assets. A tit-for-tat trade war, in which China puts tariffs on US exports, could not be ruled out either. The rest of Asia     Reaction to the US presidential election results in a bar in Tokyo. Photograph: Deletree/Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock    Barack Obama has shifted the focus of US foreign policy. For most of the postwar period, Washington has looked eastwards across the Atlantic. Since the collapse of communist Russia and the rise of China, its gaze has been westwards across the Pacific. This has been reflected in all three manifestations of American power: military, diplomatic and economic. Obama saw the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a way of keeping countries such as Japan, Brunei, Singapore and Malaysia out of Beijing\u2019s orbit. All these countries have an export-led model of growth and Obama\u2019s plan was to create a US-led free trade zone that included all the major economies of the Pacific apart from China. That plan now lies in tatters. There will be no TPP under a Trump presidency and all the signs are that countries such as South Korea and Taiwan will be subject to the same protectionist strictures as Mexico and China. This would result in slower growth across Asia as exports and investment weaken. Japan, which has been in the doldrums for a quarter of a century and which remains on the brink of deflation, appears to be most at risk, but it is not alone in being anxious about the impact of Trump. In geopolitical terms, a tough US trade stance provides China with the opportunity to increase its influence in the region, bolstering economic ties and making countries of the Pacific rim less dependent on the American market. Europe excluding Britain     A broker reacts as President-elect Donald Trump appears on a television screen at the stock market in Frankfurt, Germany. Photograph: Michael Probst/AP    The main short-term risk to Europe looks to be political rather than economic. Matteo Renzi\u2019s left of centre government may struggle to win a referendum on constitutional change in Italy next month. There are elections next year in Germany, France and the Netherlands where parties of the right will be looking to surf the populist tide that carried Trump to his win. There will be nervousness in the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia about the possibility that Russia will be emboldened by Trump\u2019s apparent isolationism. There are, however, economic and financial implications for Europe. Like Asia, the eurozone is heavily reliant on exports as a source of growth. These could be affected in two ways: through a more restrictive US trade regime and if a weaker dollar drives up the euro on the foreign exchanges.  Completing negotiations for the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) always looked like an uphill struggle because Trump was against the concept in principle and Hillary Clinton \u2013 despite being a free trader by instinct \u2013 was not prepared to spend any political capital pushing for a deal. TTIP will never happen. The relative calm of financial markets immediately after Trump\u2019s victory will come as a great relief to European banks, which look highly vulnerable to a sustained bout of jitters. For months, there have been rumours about the health of the Italian banking system and one of Germany\u2019s leading banks, Deutsche. Plentiful supplies of cheap money from the European Central Bank and relatively benign conditions in recent months have kept the problems hidden from sight. For now, at least. Britain     Political artist Kaya Mar shows a US election-themed artwork at College Green, Westminster. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock    The UK will not be immune from any slowdown in the global economy that might result from a Trump victory. Britain is the second biggest exporter of services in the world and America takes more of them than any other country. But Trump\u2019s protectionist measures are targeted at cheap manufactured goods, rather than the high-end services Britain provides, so at present there seems little reason to fear that any new barriers will be erected for UK firms. Trump has said the UK will be at the front of the queue for a new trade deal, which suggests negotiations on a bilateral TTIP-style deal could get under way between Washington and London. This would be helpful to Theresa May, who has been struggling to show that the UK can clinch its own trade deals after it leaves the EU. Her bargaining position with the other 27 members of the EU will be strengthened if she can show that she can do business with Trump, even though the stalled state of the current TTIP negotiations suggests that starting talks will be a lot easier than concluding them. In the short term, Trump\u2019s win helps take the pressure off the pound. Sterling has been sold heavily against the dollar since the EU referendum, partly because of uncertainty about what the UK will look like after Brexit. Trump\u2019s victory brings risk and uncertainty into the equation for the US as well."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-victory-us-election-winners-losers", "publicationDate": "2016-11-09T21:22:28Z", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "US elections 2016", "US politics", "US news", "China", "Japan", "Vladimir Putin", "Bashar al-Assad", "Syria", "European Union", "Nigel Farage", "United Nations", "Nato", "Asia Pacific", "Europe", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Politics"], "sentences": ["If Trump pivots away from the region, that will suit Beijing just fine, especially if it means it can accelerate its illegal expansionism in the South China Sea and ratchet up the pressure on Taiwan."], "title": "Donald Trump's election victory: the winners and losers around the world", "article": "Donald Trump triumphed, but so did Bashar al-Assad.

The dreadful Assad, soaked in blood after five years of civil war, is probably one of the big winners. But there are plenty of big losers, too.   Related: Putin applauds Trump win and hails new era of positive ties with US    Vladimir Putin heads up the first category. Trump has shown unusual partiality towards the Russian president, even though the two men have never met.  As a candidate, Trump suggested that, unlike Barack Obama, he could do business with Putin and might, for example, accept Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea.  Trump failed to condemn alleged Russian online hacking of the Democratic party and covert meddling in the election process.  He has rattled Nato allies in eastern Europe by stating that, as commander-in-chief, he would not necessarily rush to their military assistance if threatened by Russia.  In Syria and Iraq, Trump says his top priority is defeating Isis, not toppling the regime in Damascus \u2013 hence Assad\u2019s big sigh of relief. He has declined to condemn Russia\u2019s leading role in the merciless bombardment of eastern Aleppo and its actions on other Syrian battlefronts, which the UN says may constitute war crimes. It is widely believed Russia is gearing up for a final battle to take Aleppo for its ally, Assad, while the American transition is under way.  Perversely, despite his focus on Isis, little or nothing has been heard from Trump about Moscow\u2019s targeting of Syrian opposition factions rather than the jihadis.  Like the people of Syria, the citizens of Afghanistan are losers, too. For them Trump represents a new twist in an old nightmare. He sees continued US military involvement there as contrary to American interests and could simply pull out, leaving the country to the Taliban and al-Qaida.    Related: China tantalized by US election mayhem and prospect of 'thug' Trump as president    Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, is probably feeling quite good. Xi is a strong, authoritarian, quasi-dictatorial figure \u2013 the sort of leader, like Putin, that Trump appears to admire.  One can imagine the two men hitting it off on a personal level, although Xi is the more subtle of the two. He will worry about Trump\u2019s unpredictable temperament and his talk of trade tariffs on China.  Xi will relish Trump\u2019s criticism of Obama\u2019s so-called pivot to Asia, which he sees as a bid to contain China. If Trump pivots away from the region, that will suit Beijing just fine, especially if it means it can accelerate its illegal expansionism in the South China Sea and ratchet up the pressure on Taiwan.  A big Asian loser, on the face of it, is Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, who has bet the farm on closer military ties with the US. Trump says Japan and South Korea must do more to defend themselves, including possibly acquiring nuclear weapons to deter North Korea. His threats to nuke North Korea if provoked could, if realised, make losers of us all.  In contrast, a big, undeserving winner is Rodrigo Duterte, the new Philippines president, who famously called Obama a \u201cson of a whore\u201d and declared he was cutting military cooperation. Duterte, notorious for the drug-busting death squads he has unleashed, welcomed Trump\u2019s victory on Wednesday \u2013 a reaction that will likely be shared by human rights abusers from Belarus to Burma.  In Iran, Hassan Rouhani is in an even bigger bind, now that Trump is heading for the White House. His nuclear deal last year with Obama is under constant fire from conservatives, including the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In this respect, Trump has much in common with the mullahs. He called the pact \u201cthe worst ever deal in history\u201d and vowed to scrap it.  Trump\u2019s evident ignorance of and lack of interest in large parts of the world mean, for example, the pressure may be off leaders like Omar al-Bashir, Sudan\u2019s president, who stands accused of genocide and war crimes in Darfur, and the repressive regime in Saudi Arabia, responsible for documented atrocities in Yemen.  Trump does not support the international criminal court or the UN system in general. Antonio Guterres, the incoming UN secretary-general, may struggle to keep a Trump administration engaged.    Related: 'We are entering a reign of money': Mexico reels from Trump election win    Mexico \u2013 as yet not walled off \u2013 looked like another big loser, as the peso went through the floor; President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is widely loathed by his electorate for failing to challenge Trump during his surprise visit to the country in September \u2013 but in private he may be congratulating himself for getting on the right side of his new neighbour. The lukewarm reaction to Trump\u2019s success in many European capitals reflects a deep ideological as well as a political antipathy. German ministers, normally extremely cautious in public statements, went so far as to imply it was a thoroughly bad outcome.  Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, was even surlier, saying the result showed the need for Europe looking after itself.  For the EU, already battered by Brexit, Trump is bad news. His hostility to free trade means the proposed TTIP agreement is dead if not yet buried. His belief that Europe must do more to maintain its own security challenges the EU to put its money where it mouth is in developing a Euro army and other independent capabilities.  This could hardly come at a worse time for the stripped eurozone countries.  The positive reaction of rightwing populist and nationalist parties across Europe, including France\u2019s National Front, indicates that they feel his anti-establishment insurgency may facilitate theirs, as close elections loom in France, Germany and the Netherlands.  For Britain\u2019s government, however, Trump could provide a much-needed boost. Trump applauded the narrow British vote to leave the EU and hosted its best-known advocate, Nigel Farage, on the campaign trial. He disowned Obama\u2019s threat to penalise Britain\u2019s trade with the US. Trump is bad news for Nicola Sturgeon, the pro-independence, pro-EU Scottish leader.  But he may be good news for Theresa May, Britain\u2019s pro-Brexit prime minister. She was quick to congratulate Trump in flattering terms. As she faces her own possible general election test, May maybe hopes his winning aura will rub off on her."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trumps-impulsive-adventurism-and-security-in-the-asia-pacific-the-risks-and-ramifications", "publicationDate": "2016-11-10T02:20:26Z", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "Australia news", "Australian politics", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["But Trump\u2019s predisposition to deal making could prompt China to seek an accommodation about Taiwan, and in the South and East China seas."], "title": "Security in the Asia Pacific: the risks and ramifications of Trump's impulsive adventurism | Euan Graham", "article": "Now that Donald Trump\u2019s nativist insurgency has captured its capital, the rest of the world is anxious to know how that vision will be visited upon them, as Trump seeks to define his boilerplate \u201cAmerica-first\u201d slogan overseas.  In the Asia-Pacific, an immediate fear among longstanding US treaty allies, such as Japan and South Korea, is that Trump will press for greater financial contributions to host military forces in their countries \u2013 no matter that it costs the US less to deploy its military forces forward in Asia than to host them at home. One of Trump\u2019s few coherent foreign policy beliefs is that free-riding allies are exploiting America, even to the point of advocating for their independent nuclear armament in Asia. Though his antipathy towards Japan appears strongest, South Korea is more likely to cross the nuclear threshold if Trump retracts the US commitment to extended nuclear deterrence in the region. Trump has not pointed his finger at Australia as a security free-rider, despite the fact that Canberra commits a smaller percentage of national wealth to defence than Seoul, and drove a harder bargain than Tokyo on the costs of hosting US Marines. Indeed, if the kiss that Rudy Giuliani gave Joe Hockey is anything to go by, Trump\u2019s advisers love Australia.   Related: World leaders react to Donald Trump's US election victory    Yet if his administration is serious about shifting more of the regional security burden on to allies, then Canberra should brace for requests to spend more, do more, and perhaps to host more US forces in future. If Trump throttles back on US defence commitments in Asia, or if Canberra opts to distance itself from the US under new leadership, the implications are more profound.  Australia would need to commit significantly greater sums to its defence. This implication may be lost on critics of the alliance who privately welcome Trump\u2019s election as the trigger for a more independent Australian foreign policy. There is a potential upside to this contingent Trump effect, however, if it incentivises US allies and partners to cooperate more closely. The cross-bracing trend among countries including India, Japan, Australia and Singapore is already in evidence, and may now gather steam.  Trump\u2019s Reaganesque commitment to increase the size of the US navy to 350 ships (though Reagan targeted a 600-ship fleet), suggests that an isolationist military pullback in the Pacific is not in the offing. But Trump\u2019s predisposition to deal making could prompt China to seek an accommodation about Taiwan, and in the South and East China seas. It is unclear how committed he will be to the maritime defence of Asian allies that he sees as ingrates. The Duterte-Trump dynamic will be one to watch. But a rupture of the US-Australia alliance is not in prospect. This year\u2019s Lowy Institute Poll suggests Australian public support for Anzus is headed for a cold shower under Trump as 45% of respondents said Australia should distance itself from the US if he was elected. But the official ties that bind run deep, including two-way flow of intelligence. If Republican Asian security experts remain true to their pledge not to serve under a Trump administration, then Australia\u2019s importance as a source of knowledge and advice on the region will count for more, leaving aside whether Trump will have full access to his own government\u2019s intelligence. North Korea is certain to pose a major security challenge, probably early on in Trump\u2019s presidency, as it consolidates its nuclear and missile arsenal \u2013 testing out Trump\u2019s willingness to \u201cdeal\u201d. How China reacts to any North Korean crisis early on in Trump\u2019s presidency could set the tone for US-China security relations. During the campaign Trump said: \u201cChina should solve that problem for us.\u201d He is likely to be as disappointed in that expectation as his predecessors. The prospect of a game of nuclear chicken ensuing between two cocksure hustlers like Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump is deeply unsettling; more so if it comes at the front end of Trump\u2019s learning curve as commander-in-chief. But unless his bluff is obviously called, Trump is unlikely to spoil for international confrontation at the outset of his presidency, if at all.  Although he will have a Republican-controlled Congress to smooth his policy path, constitutional and other checks are likely to constrain him from impulsive adventurism. Domestic governance will occupy his time in other ways. While Trump is more insurgent than statesman, his acceptance speech points hopefully to some moderating influence from incumbency. Who advises him will be critical. The greater risk of adventurism lies further down the track of his presidency, once frustration mounts at his failure to deliver in detail on vacuous campaign promises. Foreign adversaries will also overcome their initial fears of challenging him, although North Korea is uniquely impatient in that regard. Trump\u2019s admiration for Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia is the strangest and most consequential foreign policy risk at the outset of his presidency. But if the US neglects Asia as a result, the strategic consequences will be longer lasting and more concrete.   Related: It was the rise of the Davos class that sealed America\u2019s fate | Naomi Klein    The more invidious challenge posed by a Trump presidency is to the bedrock belief that alliances with the US are bound by shared values as well as based on common interests. US leadership, on matters ranging from human rights to free trade, must now be in question, based on Trump\u2019s publicly flaunted illiberalism and narrow definition of the national interest. Asia\u2019s \u201crules-based order\u201d could still endure with US support under Trump, but the concept of a \u201cliberal international order\u201d appears much less certain. When the US does speak up on values, its moral authority will be challenged by autocrats more likely to see Trump as an authoritarian paragon. Trump\u2019s endorsement by Cambodia\u2019s pariah prime minister, Hun Sen, gave an early taste of the likely demagogic chicanery to follow.  Much as he may be admired in some quarters, for China, Russia and anti-democrats throughout the region Trump\u2019s election serves up a pastiche propaganda win of epic proportions. Most corrosive of all, the outcome of the US election poses a fundamental challenge to the attraction of the democratic model itself."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/10/bike-prices-could-rise-because-of-brexit-vote-says-halfords", "publicationDate": "2016-11-10T19:13:19Z", "tags": ["Halfords", "Cycling", "Business", "Life and style", "Retail industry", "UK news", "EU referendum and Brexit", "Politics"], "sentences": ["Halfords buys about \u00a3200m of goods a year in dollars, with bikes sourced from countries including Taiwan, Cambodia and Vietnam, and the company has already been affected."], "title": "Bike prices could rise because of Brexit vote, says Halfords", "article": "Bicycle prices could be on the way up as a result of the Brexit vote, because the cost of importing bikes from Asia has surged.

Billions of pounds is expected to be spent by shoppers over the Black Friday weekend, starting 25 November, and over the 12 days in the run-up to it.  Last year, on Black Friday, Amazon sold more than 7.4m items in the UK, a record for the company involving sales at a rate of 86 items a second. Black Friday has grown rapidly in the UK after Amazon transferred the idea from across the Atlantic in 2010 by offering deals to British customers.  This year, starting on 14 November, Amazon intends to offer discounts on products over the 12 days in the run-up to Black Friday. It will offer double the number of deals compared to last year. The online retailer said it was extending its promotions, which ran for about a week last year, in response to customer feedback. The announcement shows that retailers are preparing for another hectic period of shopping, but also that they are trying to spread out consumer spending. Black Friday has been marred by chaotic scenes in shops as people have rushed to pick up discounts and websites have crashed due to the number of visits.

Photograph: Kena Betancur/Getty    Black Friday involves online and high-street retailers offering a range of discounts on products. Its origins are disputed but the craze began in the US about 50 years ago. Black Friday is the day after the public holiday for Thanksgiving. Retailers have traditionally cut their prices to encourage consumers back into the shops. Some claim the name can be traced back to the police in Philadelphia, who gave the nickname to the day after Thanksgiving because of the chaos that ensued in the city as shoppers headed to the high street at the same time as spectators went to the annual Army vs Navy American football match. However, some retail historians claim the day is called Black Friday because it marks the day when retailers move from making a loss to a profit for the first time in the year. Black Friday led to scuffles in British supermarkets when Asda and Tesco ran in-store promotions in 2013 and 2014. Police had to be called to Tesco stores in 2014 as shoppers scrambled to pick up deals. Britain\u2019s biggest retailer was subsequently criticised for launching its Black Friday deals at midnight. However, last year Black Friday was a more subdued occasion in supermarkets and high streets, with shoppers choosing to look for deals online instead of in shops. Tesco delayed the opening of its shops until 5am, leading to much smaller queues outside its supermarkets. The surge in spending on Black Friday in the last six years has transformed the build-up to Christmas for retailers in Britain. It has brought forward spending from December and concentrated it in a tighter period, putting pressure on shops, websites and warehouses. Amazon has more than doubled its UK workforce for November and December, bringing in 20,000 temporary seasonal workers. Doug Gurr, the UK country manager for Amazon, said: \u201cIn response to positive customer feedback for Black Friday deals, we are introducing the Black Friday Sale \u2013 12 days of fantastic deals on must-have gifts and products, saving our customers millions of pounds. \u201cWe\u2019re also thrilled to have over 1,000 small businesses featuring in our Black Friday sale, broadening the selection for our customers and enabling those businesses to boost their sales in the run-up to Christmas.\u201d     In China\u2019s Jiangsu province packers get ready for Singles\u2019 Day.

This day, a Friday, has been promoted as a shopping event by Alibaba, the Chinese online retailer. Analysts at the accountancy firm KMPG believe sales could exceed $20bn (\u00a316bn) this year, up from $14bn last year. Alibaba will kick off its Singles\u2019 Day promotions with a televised gala on Thursday evening, with David Beckham replacing the singer Katy Perry as the event\u2019s \u201cglobal ambassador\u201d after she pulled out at the last minute.  Paul Martin, head of UK retail at KPMG, said: \u201cGiven the continual growth in popularity of Chinese Singles\u2019 Day, there is no doubt that sales this year will be bigger than ever. It reinforces the growing buying power of the Chinese consumer and the increasing prominence of the date in the retail calendar.  \u201cWith such consumer attention placed on Singles\u2019 Day, we could see sales jump significantly as major campaigns launched in Hong Kong and Taiwan encourage consumers to join in the action.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/11/trump-china-conundrum-clear-election-haze", "publicationDate": "2016-11-11T08:30:14Z", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "US elections 2016", "China", "Asia Pacific", "US economic growth and recession", "Economics", "Business", "World news"], "sentences": ["It will seek to exploit doubts about a Trump administration\u2019s engagement in the fraught situation in east Asia \u2013 not only over Korea and the South China Sea, but also with animosity between China and Japan, the unresolved matter of Taiwan and growing the way the US urged governments to participate in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and then repudiated the trade deal."], "title": "As the election haze clears, Trump\u2019s China conundrum will become clear | Jonathan Fenby", "article": "It may well be the greatest test of whether the cold reality of office dampens the campaign rhetoric of the next occupant of the White House. Out on the stump, there was no doubt which country Donald Trump held most guilty for the loss of American jobs and saw as the major obstacle to making America Great Again. But going head to head with China would involve a nexus of problems that a business-savvy chief executive should wish to avoid. So will Trump\u2019s natural combativeness and the pumped-up feelings of his core supporters prevail, or will reason force itself on him?    Going head-to-head with China would involve a nexus of problems that a savvy chief executive should wish to avoid    The China conundrum is emblematic of the huge uncertainty surrounding the president-elect. We know the campaign rhetoric about slapping a 45% tariff on Chinese goods. We know that he accuses Beijing of being a currency manipulator and using America as a \u201cpiggy bank\u201d. We know the person he endorses as \u201cright on\u201d about China, university professor Peter Navarro, sees war with the People\u2019s Republic as \u201cvery likely\u201d, argues that \u201cBill Clinton sold America down the Shanghai River\u201d, and urges the US to fight China\u2019s mercantilism by being tough on trade and taxing China\u2019s exports. But President Trump would be well advised to steer away from the rhetoric of Candidate Trump in dealing with the world\u2019s second biggest economy and the rising superpower, accepting the all-important nuances of the world\u2019s single most important relationship. When Deng Xiaoping perceived at the end of the 1970s that the way to make China great again and to save the Communist party from implosion was to pursue economic growth, he turned to exports. The bargain that emerged suited everybody, and led to the entry of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) into the World Trade Organisation in 2001. China got its growth from selling cheap goods abroad, and attracted foreign investment and technology. Rich countries, led by the US, got cheap imports that kept down inflation and satisfied consumers. The deal got even better when Beijing recycled its earnings into US government bonds, providing capital to help fuel a credit binge. That changed in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. Barack Obama skirted round the China question as best he could. Now Trump has to decide how to proceed. It is no longer simply an economic issue. Abandoning Deng\u2019s advice to keep a low international profile, Xi Jinping aspires to walk tall beside any president from across the Pacific. Though far behind America in terms of overall military strength, the PRC has been building up its forces and asserting its presence in the South China Sea. Forecasts that it will rule the world are confounded by a host of political, economic, social and strategic factors. But, for a president who aspires to make America the unchallenged world champion, the presence of a country intent on becoming equal geopolitical number one can only be troubling. There is no shortage of issues on which to confront China, stretching from trade through intellectual property rights to the mainland\u2019s reef-building programme in the South China Sea and its unwillingness or incapacity to bring North Korea to heel. One might even add human rights, if they seemed a matter of concern to any of the presidential candidates. But if Beijing comes under pressure on one front, it is likely to react on another. The economic story is interconnected; slapping tariffs on products made in China may play well in depressed manufacturing areas, but there would be a big negative effect on US firms with plants on the mainland, or which assemble goods there \u2013 and Chinese retaliation would hit their important mainland revenues. Beijing is making the most of the electoral outcome, its media warning that this is what democracy brings. It will seek to exploit doubts about a Trump administration\u2019s engagement in the fraught situation in east Asia \u2013 not only over Korea and the South China Sea, but also with animosity between China and Japan, the unresolved matter of Taiwan and growing the way the US urged governments to participate in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and then repudiated the trade deal. Trump\u2019s talk of changing the relationship with allies adds to the discomfort. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, quickly booked himself a meeting with the president-elect, who is said to regard treaties as akin to contracts open to renegotiation. Four decades on from China\u2019s economic opening-up, there is little mutual trust between it and the US, but each knows it needs the other. A grand deal between Washington and Beijing remains highly elusive. If Trump were to aspire to seek it \u2013 in a new, realpolitik framework \u2013 he would have to turn his back on core voters and manage a multifaceted strategy at odds with the simplicity of his campaign and his isolationist tendencies. Hence the importance of the test \u2013 and the probability that each side will continue to prefer to rub along with the other."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/11/virtual-reality-firms-make-play-for-mainstream-with-video-arcades", "publicationDate": "2016-11-11T10:23:33Z", "tags": ["Virtual reality", "Technology", "US news", "World news", "Technology sector", "Business", "Technology startups", "Internet"], "sentences": ["ViveX will have two offices in China, one in Taiwan and one in San Francisco."], "title": "Virtual reality firms revive video arcades as they aim for the mainstream", "article": "Above me is the Hillary Step, a sheer vertical face of rock about 12 metres high on the south-east ridge of Mount Everest. In a brisk breeze, snow eddies around my boots. I reach out my thickly gloved hand to connect a carabiner to a rope to pull myself up the rock wall. In reality, of course, I\u2019m not scaling the world\u2019s tallest mountain but strapped to a machine in a stuffy, darkened room in a Los Angeles convention centre. This is Everest VR, a virtual reality experience on HTC\u2019s Vive which, along with Facebook\u2019s Oculus Rift headset, is one of the top-end VR devices available. The Everest app was stitched together from more than 300,000 photographs and while linear in structure, it\u2019s not really a game \u2013 more a showcase for the hardware \u2013 it is captivating. At Vive\u2019s ivy-coated offices in San Francisco\u2019s Mission district, there\u2019s a feeling among developers that VR stands on the edge of a boom. Its following among video gamers is already very established. However, it\u2019s still early days for more mainstream consumers who will need to get to grips with the expense and complexity of a new technology if they want to give it a try.   Related: The complete guide to virtual reality \u2013 everything you need to get started    Outside of early-adopting technology fans, consumers are notoriously conventional. VR requires them to strap on an unflattering headset and headphones, risk nausea and disorientation and face the more subtle discomfort of having to learn how to navigate a new space, where even selecting the next option on a menu is a new experience. Watching someone else using VR is also an unappealing advert for it. So faced with all this, how will VR companies try and inspire mainstream consumers to have a try?  One answer, they think, will be by reviving the traditional video game arcade. At Vive, the head of their app store division says that slice of the market alone could be worth as much as $100m (\u00a379m) in the next two years.  Return of the video arcade \u201cFrom the largest amusement centers to arcade installations at family entertainment locations, virtual reality is clearly becoming the next big draw for entertainment,\u201d said Rikard Steiber, the president of Viveport. \u201cWe believe this will be a cornerstone in democratizing access to high-end virtual reality and turning curious consumers into longtime fans.\u201d This is already a trend in China, according to Vive spokesman, Meelad Sadat, who said some chains already have thousands of branches open. Viveport Arcade wants to connect developers with arcade owners.  Sadat said: \u201cIf you\u2019re a small indie developer it\u2019s hard to reach out to thousands of arcade operators around the world, but also if you are an arcade operator in China it\u2019s hard for you to keep up with hundreds of new developers all the time.\u201d He added that the potential market size is huge if you look back to golden era of arcades.     Pac-Man made $3.5bn revenue in 1990 alone, says the maker behind the HTC Vive VR headset Photograph: Alamy    \u201cIn 1990 Pac-Man ... made $3.5bn (\u00a32.7bn) in revenue,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just one game.\u201d  Running demonstrations in public arcades neatly bypasses one of the more complex rituals of investing in a VR kit: setting it up in your own home. HTC\u2019s Vive, regarded as the highest-quality device, comes with movement sensors that require configuration similar to a high-end home audio set up. For the moment, it also requires an expensive, powerful computer to run. But perhaps the real incentive will be in the VR games and films themselves. Jenna Seiden, the head of content acquisition for Vive, said that far from being just games, the future of VR from a content standpoint was limitless.  \u201cWe don\u2019t know what are going to be the breakout formats, but right now we are at a very nascent stage where anything goes,\u201d she said. She showed me some early versions of business apps by General Electric and Ikea, and the virtual meeting space AltSpace, which is already being used for everything from virtual standup comedy gigs to debate watch-parties. Artists \u2018can build worlds to be intensely emotive in\u2019 For artists though, VR is an entirely new medium with few established conventions. It\u2019s ripe for exploration. Allumette is an exquisite animated film set in a town of floating platforms in the clouds, while Reframe Iran offers cinematic, interactive storytelling about the work of Iranian artists, and can be viewed on entry-level VR equipment such as Google\u2019s Cardboard.     Virtually Reality\u2019s experimental space in Camden, north London, provides an affordable way for developers and artists to experiment with VR Photograph: Virtually Reality    \u201cBy seeing their work \u2013 when you put on the VR headset you were in the interviewer\u2019s spot \u2013 it\u2019s like you\u2019re having a conversation with the artist,\u201d said Reframe Iran\u2019s director Alexandra Glorioso. \u201cThat was really powerful because Iran is so misunderstood by Americans. That\u2019s another use to virtual reality, to introduce people to different cultures, times, events, by really transporting them there.\u201d    You\u2019re at the forefront of an emerging medium, like in the early days of cinema.  Karrie Fransman, graphic novelist and artist     For Glorioso, VR really lends itself to journalism. \u201cIf you bring [a virtual reality camera] to a rally or a protest it can show the audience what\u2019s really going on,\u201d she said. The Guardian recently built its own VR project, called 6x9, which allowed people to experience the tangible and horrifying reality of solitary confinement. Karrie Fransman, a London-based graphic novelist and artist, tried Google\u2019s Tilt Brush, which allows artists to paint in three dimensions. \u201cThe first time I tried Tilt Brush it felt like I was painting with my left foot,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after four hours I\u2019d gotten the hang of it. It\u2019s a bit like magic.\u201d Fransman said the possibilities VR offers to artists are endless. \u201cIt gives us the opportunity to build worlds that are intensely emotive to be in. You remember them as places you\u2019ve been rather than things you\u2019ve seen.\u201d     An arcade set up to host Viveland - FrontDefense, a virtual reality game for the HTC Vive Photograph: HTC    As a comic book artist and someone interested in visual storytelling, Fransman said VR offers an opportunity to draw stories across a visible space so the reader can walk between scenes. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to be involved with VR at this stage,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re at the forefront of an emerging medium, like in the early days of cinema.\u201d Fransman does not have her own VR setup yet and used Tilt Brush at Virtually Reality, a space for startups and consumers to use ready-made VR kits in Camden, London. \u201cI got frustrated that there wasn\u2019t anywhere I can go and play with the stuff I was seeing on Kickstarter, and that not many people knew about these emerging platforms,\u201d said Virtually Reality founder Alexander Cohen. He hopes to franchise Virtually Reality across the world and wants to have 100 locations by 2020. Encouraging developers to build His approach involves VR setups in a public space, like old-school 80s arcades, is the same one envisioned by HTC. They announced in November that they were expanding Viveport \u2013 their online marketplace for games and applications, based on the merger between HTC and online game distributor Steam \u2013 to encompass an Arcade program.  Yet for developers, building for VR requires serious resources. HTC recognises that its users will expect high-quality content, and is trying to address this by setting up ViveX, a $100m accelerator. ViveX will have two offices in China, one in Taiwan and one in San Francisco. The aim is to connect independent developers of everything from games to business-to-business applications with HTC\u2019s hardware, office space, funding and development expertise.

Bill Clinton had it in his wallet with his credit cards, but then lost the wallet.

Related: Ten inconsistencies in Donald Trump's big foreign policy address    There is one such situation already in the in-tray Trump will find on his desk, on the Korean peninsula, where the North Korean regime is rapidly developing a long-range nuclear missile. Another could blow up at any time with Russia, whose warplanes are flying increasingly close to Nato planes and ships in a high-stakes game of chicken. And Trump could trigger a third crisis, with Iran, if he follows through with his threat to tear up last year\u2019s agreement curbing its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. Trump\u2019s election has added a new layer of uncertainty to all these potential flashpoints. \u201cI have no idea what he would do, and neither I suspect, does he,\u201d said James Acton, the co-director of the nuclear policy programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves he has policies for these issues. He doesn\u2019t have a team that has done deep dives into these questions.\u201d  The temperament question During the campaign, 10 former US nuclear launch officers, who once manned missile silos and held the keys necessary to execute a launch order, signed a letter saying Trump should not have his \u201cfinger on the button\u201d because of his temperament.  One of those former officers, Bruce Blair, said that if US early warning radar showed the country was under attack by nuclear missiles, there would be time for a president to receive a briefing that could be as short as 30 seconds and the commander-in-chief would then have between three and 12 minutes to make up his mind. He would have to take into account that the early warning system had been wrong before and could be vulnerable to ever more sophisticated hacking. \u201cI think [Trump] lacks knowledge of the world, and knowledge of nuclear weapons and the consequences of their use. He\u2019s not competent. He lashes out at the smallest provocation and he divides the world into winners and losers,\u201d Blair said. \u201cHe\u2019s a bully and I wouldn\u2019t have confidence that he would be reasoned and restrained in a crisis.\u201d Others have argued that in reality, the decision time is not that short. The fact that the US has so many options \u2013 land- and sea-based missiles as well as bombers \u2013 means it does not have to launch on warning of an attack. There would be more time for Trump to think and ask for advice. \u201cThe prompt launch of our nuclear missiles is not required nor is it US policy,\u201d Peter Huessy, president of Geostrategic Analysis and a guest lecturer at the US Naval Academy, argued. North Korea Kim Jong-un has accelerated testing of nuclear weapons and missiles, and most analysts believe he will reach the capability of making a miniaturised warhead that could be put on an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US west coast within Trump\u2019s first term as president.  Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that Pyongyang could seize the opportunity of presidential transition to test Trump\u2019s mettle. \u201cI am worried about the people Trump is going to put in charge on that file,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cHe is facing a very empty bench. Many of the Republican foreign policy establishment are \u2018never-Trumpers\u2019, and the North Korea problem is not going to wait.\u201d  Trump has offered to talk to Kim, offering the possibility of breaking through the diplomatic impasse that has cut off almost all engagement with the regime. But a unilateral move could unnerve US allies in the region, already anxious about Trump\u2019s remarks during the campaign suggesting they do not contribute enough to deserve the shelter of the US nuclear umbrella.  \u201cHe has talked about Nato and our alliances with South Korea and Japan as though they are protection rackets,\u201d Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Programme at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. \u201cThis is particularly dangerous in South Korea, where there is a significant group of people who think Seoul should be more independent of Washington and acquire nuclear weapons. Asked about Japan or South Korea building nuclear weapons, Trump said \u2018have a good time\u2019. Japan probably won\u2019t take him up on the offer, but South Korea might. I worry South Korea might be followed by Taiwan.\u201d  Iran  Trump has threatened to tear up the nuclear deal six major powers signed with Iran last year, in which Iran scaled down its nuclear programme in return for relief from international sanctions. He and other Republicans have argued that the US would get more concessions if they reapplied sanctions.  \u201cThat would be a catastrophic decision,\u201d Acton said. \u201cThe other parties to this deal would still consider themselves bound by it, whether or not the US did. If we withdrew, the Iranians would demand redress, and the other parties would be sympathetic. If you want to put pressure on Iran you need multilateral sanctions. Behaving unilaterally is very unlikely to work.\u201d Even before taking office, Trump would be under heavy pressure from the other parties to the deal \u2013 the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China \u2013 who have started investing and trading with Iran, not to deliver on his threat.  Doing so could isolate the US and potentially trigger a nuclear arms race in the Gulf.  Russia      Russian dolls in the likeness of Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin and the US president-elect, Donald Trump. Photograph: Tass / Barcroft Images    Trump has claimed he could improve relations with Russia, and in particular with Vladimir Putin personally, that would defuse the high tensions over Ukraine and Syria. Such deals could well be at the expense of the people of those countries, but could conceivably lessen the chances of a complete end to arms control and the return to an expensive and dangerous nuclear arms race. Hans Kristensen, a nuclear expert at the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), points out that the deepest cuts in nuclear arsenals have been achieved by Republican administrations. \u201cRepublicans love nuclear weapons reductions, as long as they\u2019re not proposed by a Democratic president,\u201d Kristensen wrote on an FAS blog  \u201cThat is the lesson from decades of US nuclear weapons and arms control management. If that trend continues, then we can expect the new Donald Trump administration to reduce the US nuclear weapons arsenal more than the Obama administration did.\u201d  The current arms treaty limiting the strategic arsenals of both countries, New Start, expires in 2021. A decision will have to be made whether to replace it or let arms control wither. Both Putin and Trump could save tens of billions of dollars by cutting arsenals. As part of any deal, however, Putin would ask for the scrapping of the US missile defence system currently being erected in eastern Europe. Any concessions on the US trillion-dollar nuclear weapon modernisation programme, which Trump endorses in his transition website, would bring him in direct conflict with the Republican establishment.  \u201cI could imagine Trump personally being more flexible,\u201d Acton said. \u201cBut it would set up a huge fight with Congress.

Unused to the awesome responsibility of the Oval Office, under fierce pressure to act, enraged by Isis\u2019s personal jibes, infuriated by accusations of dithering, and determined not to show weakness, it is easy to imagine Trump making a wrong, hasty and disastrous call. With a few hot-headed words, translated into situation-room orders, Trump could not only lose the pilot, he could plunge the US inextricably into the quagmire of another Middle East war.    There are grave doubts about Trump's inexperience, volatile temperament and macho instincts    Grave doubts about Trump\u2019s inexperience, volatile temperament and macho instincts also apply in other global hotspots where a US president\u2019s actions, or inaction, are always critical and sometimes lethal. Here are five dangerous flashpoint issues that could suddenly and unpredictably test the novice president\u2019s judgment, cool and common sense in the first 100 days of his tenure. SYRIA AND IRAQ The Isis hostage scenario is not wholly imaginary. In January last year, a Royal Jordanian air force pilot, Muath al-Kasasbeh, was captured and burned to death in a cage by the jihadis after negotiations for his release failed. Similar repeat incidents involving US, European and Arab members of the anti-Isis coalition, and local forces, are becoming more likely as the endgame in the fight against the Isis caliphate approaches. The battle is being fought out on two main fronts. One is the siege of Mosul, northern Iraq\u2019s principal city. Trump has criticised the conduct of the campaign, which involves the mainly Shia Iraqi army, Kurdish and Sunni Arab militias backed by 300 US special forces commandos. But he has not offered an alternative strategy. Much the same holds true of the attempt to seize the Isis headquarters in Raqqa, in northern Syria. Trump says that defeating terrorism is a top priority and he will \u201cbomb the shit out of Isis\u201d. But nobody, including him, appears to know what this means in practice. If the battle goes badly, will he escalate? Will he carpet-bomb cities where millions of civilians live? Is he prepared to deploy US ground forces? What will he do if, as seems possible, both sieges become bogged down, or Isis begins mass, daily executions of civilians? Trump is also silent about Turkey\u2019s significant military intervention in Syria and Iraq and its parallel fight with the Kurds. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan wants two things from Trump: an end to US support for the Kurdish peshmerga and the extradition of Fethullah G\u00fclen, a cleric exiled in the US who he blames for last summer\u2019s failed coup. With Isis on the back foot and the Iraqi and Syrian governments weakened, the Turkey-Kurd feud could explode at any time as the protagonists try to redraw national boundaries and compete for territory and resources. RUSSIA AND EASTERN EUROPE Trump has raised expectations that he can repair the US rupture with Russia. But a reset will come with a price. In the first instance, Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s authoritarian president, will want a relaxation or scrapping of punitive sanctions imposed after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. To dismay in Europe, Trump has suggested he may agree. Putin also seems likely to get his way in Syria, where Russian forces have pushed his client, Bashar al-Assad, to the brink of victory in Aleppo and elsewhere. Trump has made no serious objection to Russian actions in Syria, even though the UN says they may constitute war crimes. He seems content to have Assad remain in power, or even to treat him as an anti-Isis ally. However, the regime\u2019s renewed use of chemical weapons, for example, new Russian atrocities, or a suddenly escalating humanitarian and refugee catastrophe could all trigger a new crisis that blows up in Trump\u2019s face, forcing him to move against Putin. The idea of no-fly zones and civilian safe havens still has backers. If Trump goes down this route, he could end up directly confronting Russia\u2019s military. The European allies cannot do much about Trump\u2019s Syria insouciance. But they will strongly oppose him if he tries to run down the Nato alliance, as he has suggested. Russian pressure on Nato\u2019s easternmost members in the Baltic republics, Poland and Bulgaria \u2013 in terms of political meddling, disinformation, cyber attacks, missile deployments and military exercises \u2013 is reaching new heights. Influence-peddling and destabilisation operations are increasingly reported in Moldova, Montenegro and elsewhere in the Balkans. Eastern Ukraine remains a ticking timebomb. Any of these flashpoints could ignite at any time in Trump\u2019s first 100 days. European governments want to present a strong, united front. But Trump seems more interested in buying Russia off by acquiescing in Putin\u2019s reclamation of former cold war spheres of influence. Trump\u2019s disdain for the EU \u2013 he loudly applauded Britain\u2019s vote to leave \u2013 and critical European reaction to his election, notably in Germany and France, point to a possible US-Europe schism down the road. If it happens, Trump will have helped Putin achieve a long-cherished Russian strategic objective, shattering 70 years of Euro-Atlanticism. CHINA Beijing shows no sign of backing away from its expansionist policies in the South China and East China seas. It is busily transforming reefs and tiny islands into military bases, which will ultimately give it control of sea lanes through which much of the world\u2019s maritime trade passes. China continues to ignore the rival territorial claims of neighbouring countries, including Japan, whose commerce is directly threatened. To counter China, the US and Japan have stepped up naval and air patrols in the disputed areas. They have also pursued closer military cooperation with Vietnam and other regional states such as Australia. A recent UN court ruling in the Hague on a complaint brought by the Philippines rejected China\u2019s claims as illegal. But Beijing rejected the decision, and has since sought to woo the Philippines\u2019 anti-American president, Rodrigo Duterte. It is more than likely, on present trends, that the US and Chinese militaries will, sooner or later, come into direct confrontation, either by air or at sea. Until now a clash has been avoided, partly because neither side knows where it would lead. Nationalist feeling in China is periodically whipped up by the Communist party. If Trump blunders into this delicate situation, or deliberately tries to push the Chinese back, the fallout could be dangerous. In terms of tripwires, Taiwan is, as always, a trap for an unwary American leader. Taiwan elected a new president earlier this year whom the Chinese suspect of pursuing an independence agenda. It has since increased pressure on Taipei, including suspending talks. Taiwan has been a frozen conflict for so long that it is hard to imagine it suddenly going \u201clive\u201d. But Xi Jinping, China\u2019s hard-headed president, is clear that he will not wait indefinitely for reunification. Like Trump, he is used to getting what he wants. NORTH KOREA AND IRAN The issue of nuclear proliferation links these two countries. Iran has always denied possessing or trying to acquire or build nuclear weapons in the past. Last year\u2019s landmark pact between Washington, its European partners and Tehran produced pledges that Iran would not seek to make a bomb in the future, or at least for the next 10 years. But Trump is on record as saying the deal is a bad one and should be scrapped. This stance plays into the hands of hardline clerics in Tehran who have consistently opposed president Hassan Rouhani\u2019s policy of nuclear concessions in return for UN sanctions relief. Israel\u2019s right-wing government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump\u2019s new best friend (see below), also wants the deal scrapped. If Trump reneges, Rouhani will be undermined, as will be global counter-proliferation efforts. North Korea\u2019s dictator, Kim Jong-un, not only already has nuclear weapons, but is accelerating and expanding the country\u2019s weapons-building programmes, much to the alarm of Japan, South Korea and the west. In the past, Trump suggested he might meet Kim. The offer was laughed off in Pyongyang. A parlay between Kim and Trump might set some kind of record for clashing egos. But it would be unlikely to achieve much. Trump\u2019s other suggestion, that Japan and South Korea acquire nuclear weapons to deter North Korea, was one of his more irresponsible \u2013 and insensitive, given Japan\u2019s unique experience in 1945. North Korea will be watching the Trump administration closely. If it senses Trump is distracted, or disinterested in Asian security issues (which has certainly appeared to be the case until now), Kim could try something provocative or risky, if only to test US reactions. Given that he is three-parts unhinged, that is a scary prospect. ISRAEL AND PALESTINE     Donald Trump with Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu in New York. Photograph: Reuters    Trump has taken a staunchly pro-Israel line since running for president and has promised to be the country\u2019s \u201cclosest friend\u201d. What this may mean in practice is the subject of speculation. But Trump advisers have told Israeli media that one of his first acts will be to order the removal of the US embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Such a decision, resisted by past Democrat and Republican presidents alike, is of enormous symbolic importance since it would represent de facto recognition of Israel\u2019s claim to all of Jerusalem as its indivisible capital. It would negate, in one sweeping gesture, the Palestinians\u2019 claim to east Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent Palestinian state. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, has been careful to keep on the right side of Trump, having fallen out with Barack Obama over US peacemaking efforts and a range of other issues. Netanyahu\u2019s obsequiousness may be paying off. As far as is known, he is the first foreign leader to be invited to the Trump White House. Some of his more hardline cabinet ministers are meanwhile predicting the end of any American efforts to implement a two-state solution. The Palestinian leadership has politely congratulated Trump on his success. But if he makes the Jerusalem switch, anger in the occupied territories and Gaza will be intense, and could quickly turn violent. Another intifada is the very last thing the Middle East needs. But as the world now knows, uprisings are a Trump speciality."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/13/isatu-touray-who-is-going-to-change-gambia-elections-yahya-jammeh", "publicationDate": "2016-11-13T07:00:12Z", "tags": ["The Gambia", "Africa", "World news"], "sentences": ["The list of erstwhile backers of the Gambia is long; it includes Libya, Taiwan and Iran."], "title": "Isatu Touray: \u2018Who is going to change Gambia, if not us?\u2019", "article": "Dr Isatou Touray \u200bis on the campaign trail. Over the coming 15 days, the 61-year-old women\u2019s rights activist and academic will cover hundreds of miles, bouncing over rutted rural roads and through narrow lanes in crowded cities, addressing rally after rally. Most will be small affairs on scrubby soccer pitches in villages or supporters\u2019 yards. A few will be joyous, as political meetings in Africa often are. But most will be restrained, with fear of the present as powerful as any hope for change in the future. Few policymakers in the west have ever paid much attention to the west African state of the Gambia,\u200b a \u200bcountry of only two million inhabitants with little strategic importance and no major resources. Few of the 160,000 tourists drawn to the Gambia\u2019s beaches last year were interested in local politics\u200b either\u200b. \u200bBut the Gambia, a former British colony, is facing a critical test. \u200bTouray and the other politicians in the newly formed coalition of opposition parties are seeking to unseat President Yahya Jammeh, who has ruled the Gambia with an iron fist since taking power, aged 29, in a military coup in 1994. In recent months, as election day on 1 December has approached, Jammeh has unleashed a wave of repression. \u201cI am worried about my safety and about my supporters too. We are taking a calculated risk. But who is going to change Gambia if not the Gambians?\u201d, Touray, who was standing as an independent until joining forces with other opposition factions last week, told the Observer. The danger is very real. In recent years Jammeh has relied on brutal security agencies to stifle growing dissent. Earlier this year a series of protests led to the detention of more than 90 opposition activists and supporters. One prominent opposition politician, a father of nine, was beaten to death in custody. His body has not been returned to his family. Thirty, including the head of the biggest opposition party, were given three-year jail sentences. Many remain in jails where abuse is systematic. The detentions continue. Last week the head of the Gambian state TV and radio services was arrested after images showing substantial crowds of opposition supporters were broadcast, dissidents have said. Jim Wormington, a west Africa expert at campaign group Human Rights Watch, described Touray as a \u201creally courageous woman who is putting herself at great risk\u201d. The president, who has described the opposition as \u201cvermin\u201d who will be \u201cburied nine feet under the ground\u201d, has brushed aside criticism from the European Union, the United Nations, the UK and other African states. \u201cPeople die in custody or during interrogations, it\u2019s really common \u2026 No one can tell me what to do in my country,\u201d he told one interviewer earlier this year. Elections are held every five years in the Gambia. Jammeh\u2019s Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC) has won every one since 1996. This time Touray believes that he will lose. \u201cWe are all campaigning to call on the population to ensure that there is an overwhelming majority. The possibility of rigging is there, so we want to make sure there is no doubt who has won,\u201d she\u00a0said. Experts believe that the coalition\u2019s chances of success are slim, however. Alex Vines, head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, the London-based geopolitical thinktank, said opposition figures were brave but were likely to be disappointed. \u201cThere is no chance of an upset. Jammeh will be re-elected and be west Africa\u2019s longest-serving leader,\u201d Vines said. Jammeh has also proved one of the most mercurial heads of state on the continent. His mix of pan-Africanist rhetoric and resurgent Islamic identity \u2013 combined with an increasingly urgent need for funds as the economy falters badly \u2013 has led to policy choices which confound observers. \u201cThere is no ideological or diplomatic basis, no rationale. Policy is driven by his own idiosyncrasies,\u201d said Sidi Sanneh, a former foreign minister and dissident who lives in the United States. The list of erstwhile backers of the Gambia is long; it includes Libya, Taiwan and Iran. Many have been alienated by a series of unpredictable efforts to switch allies. Relations with neighbouring Senegal are poor, and the country is increasingly isolated. In 2013 Jammeh withdrew the Gambia from the Commonwealth, describing it as a neocolonial institution. Aid from the EU has been cut over concerns for human rights. A key trade agreement with the US has been abrogated, and Jammeh has also withdrawn the Gambia from the international criminal court, arguing that the institution is biased against Africans. Last December the president declared the country an Islamic republic \u2013 making it Africa\u2019s second, after Mauritania. Analysts say the move had two aims: to bolster domestic support in a country which is 90% Muslim, and to attract new backers among wealthy states in the Middle East. So far, the strategy has met with little success on either count. Jammeh has also shown himself committed to fighting climate change. A significant rise in sea levels could flood much of the country, and is already affecting tourism.     President Yahya Jammeh addressing the United Nations in 2014. Photograph: Frank Franklin II/AP    After languishing in geopolitical obscurity for decades, a wave of refugees from the Gambia has focused more attention on the country. The combination of repression and poverty has driven tens, possibly hundreds, of thousands of young people out of the country in recent years, many heading across the Sahara to the Mediterranean coast in a desperate bid to start new lives in Europe. The route, known locally as \u201cthe back way\u201d, is extremely dangerous, with many perishing in the Sahara or during the hazardous sea crossing. One recent casualty was Fatim Jawara, the teenage goalkeeper of the Gambia\u2019s national women\u2019s football team, who drowned in a shipwreck while trying to reach Italy. Jawara had told her family that she wanted to \u201cfollow her destiny\u201d and play for a major European club \u201cwhatever the risks\u201d. Last week a famous Gambian wrestler drowned in another shipwreck. The only way to stem the exodus was change, said\u00a0Touray. \u201cWe need to convince our young people to remain. But there are no jobs, there is abuse, there is no hope \u2026 Gambia is going to change for sure. We need a vanguard for change. We know it is dangerous, but \u2026 if we do not stand up, who will?\u201d     Shoppers in Banjul, the Gambia\u2019s capital.

We don\u2019t know who is going to be in his cabinet working on these issues. And I know the Chinese are trying to figure that out as well.\u201d But, as the dust settles on last week\u2019s epochal political rupture, some are speculating that the reality TV star could be preparing an extreme makeover of US-China ties that would see the New York property mogul attempt to broker his most audacious ever deal with China\u2019s authoritarian leaders. Orville Schell, a revered China scholar who has been writing about the Asian country since the days of Mao Zedong, said that boded badly for human rights activists, who would be cast aside by the Trump administration as it sought to forge a new friendship with Beijing.  \u201cThese sort of people will be roadkill in the way of his big leader machinations to reformat things [with China] and prove his acumen as a powerful and catalytic deal-maker,\u201d he predicted.  Schell, the director of the Centre on US-China Relations at New York\u2019s Asia Society, said he believed that, despite Trump\u2019s fondness for China-bashing, the incoming president might now embark on an astonishing overhaul of the Washington-Beijing relationship. \u201cThis guy has just gotten in here and has literally pulled the whole edifice of Sino-US relations down,\u201d said the academic, who is part of a 20-member taskforce that has been preparing to make recommendations on China policy to the new president. \u201cIt could recast things in a very interesting but unpredictable way.\u201d China\u2019s leaders have offered a typically cautious public response to the tycoon\u2019s stunning triumph. \u201cFacts have shown that cooperation is the only correct choice,\u201d President Xi Jinping reportedly told the American mogul on Monday in their first telephone conversation, hailing what he called \u201cimportant opportunities and the huge potential\u201d for US-China relations.  But political observers believe Beijing will have immediately seen the silver lining of Trump\u2019s victory.  Shen Dingli, the head of the Centre for American Studies at Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University, said the wheeler-dealer\u2019s elevation to the White House meant a \u201cmore collaborative relationship\u201d was now on the cards. \u201cIn everything he is better than Clinton,\u201d Shen said, before launching into a lengthy list of Trump\u2019s perceived merits. With Trump in the Oval Office Shen predicted grumbling about human rights would cease, US troops would be pulled out of Japan and South Korea, aircraft carriers withdrawn from the South China Sea and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) \u2013 which Beijing regards as an attempt to muscle in on its backyard \u2013 scrapped. \u201cWe want to positively work with him to build a stronger and greater America and a stronger and greater China,\u201d Shen said. \u201cWe must welcome him.\u201d Schell said he suspected an even more torrid affair was now in the making. Just as Trump has made overtures to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, so too would he seek to spice up US-China ties, breathing new life into a relationship that has grown frosty under Obama amid tensions over cyber-hacking, human rights and the South China Sea.  \u201cIt might actually quite astound us,\u201d Schell said of the potentially seismic strategic shift he believes would be partly inspired by the recent detente between China and the Philippines\u2019 Rodrigo Duterte. Already, the two sides appear to be gearing up for such a reconciliation. Last week a foreign ministry spokesperson dismissed as \u201cunfounded\u201d claims that Trump had engaged in negative attacks on China during his campaign. On Monday state media quoted Trump as telling Xi he believed \u201cthe two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward\u201d while the president-elect\u2019s team said the pair had \u201cestablished a clear sense of mutual respect\u201d.  Step one of this unforeseen rapprochement might be a state visit to Beijing where Trump, unlike Obama during his recent trip to the G20, would receive the reddest of red carpet welcomes.  \u201cHe would be completely suggestible to the grandiose goosestepping soldiers, the parade, all the pomp and ceremony and ritual that the Chinese do so well,\u201d Schell said. The veteran Asia specialist saw Trump jetting into the Chinese capital determined to strike a deal with Xi, a strongman leader whose preeminence was reaffirmed last month when he became only the fourth Chinese leader to be declared \u201cthe core\u201d of the Communist party. \u201cTrump\u2019s modus operandi is big leader couture: \u2018I\u2019m the leader. I know what to do. Just let me do it.\u2019 And I think here, actually, there is a great consonance with China and Xi Jinping,\u201d Schell said. \u201cSo we could be very surprised at how quickly things change; how old barriers that divided us in value terms and just the conventions of the way international affairs work are just ignored and the whole kaleidoscope changes into a very different picture. \u201cLook at the South China Sea. Look at the East China Sea. One could imagine Trump just saying: \u2018Oh don\u2019t worry about that stuff. If that is important to you, go ahead. Let\u2019s just divide up the world here. If this is your core interest, go ahead. You work it out with your neighbours. But why don\u2019t you give us X or Y?\u2019 \u201cPossibly he could trade off let\u2019s say Korea for the South China Sea and the East China Sea. It is hard to know. But I think we are going to get into a flurry of very megalomaniacal efforts at deal-making.\u201d Such a scenario would be devastating to the US\u2019 regional allies and liberal Americans alike. \u201cAll these quaint notions [of human rights, international law and loyalty to friends] could be abandoned in a heartbeat.\u201d But, paradoxically, Schell argued that it was possible there could be a \u201czinc lining\u201d to the abrupt change in course.  The US political upheaval might pave the way for a dramatic and, in the long-term, healthy reboot for what has become an increasingly toxic rivalry that some fear could eventually lead to war between the world\u2019s two greatest powers. \u201cSometimes it takes a war to change the paradigm, sometimes it takes an economic collapse,\u201d Schell said. \u201cIn this occasion we have had a kind of political implosion. And one should never discount the ability of such a tectonic orogeny to reformat how countries interact.\u201d Not all China specialists are convinced Trump\u2019s rise will transform US-China relations.  Haenle, the head of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre in Beijing, played down the idea Beijing was hoping Trump would undergo either a Duterte-esque conversion or try to mimic Richard Nixon, who reestablished relations with his historic 1972 mission to meet Mao.  \u201cI don\u2019t think that they have any grand notions that he is a Nixon. I think they are just hoping that he will be practical and pragmatic in his approach with China ... They don\u2019t want somebody who is going to make dramatic changes.\u201d One of the only clues as to Trump\u2019s blueprint for the region can be found in a Foreign Policy article published on the eve of his election by two policy advisers. One is Peter Navarro, a notorious China hawk whose bibliography includes books called Death by China and The Coming China Wars.  Earlier this year Navarro told the Guardian action was needed against China\u2019s \u201cbrutal, authoritarian communist government\u201d and accused Beijing of unleashing \u201ccarnage\u201d on the US economy with its \u201crapacious\u201d trade policies and currency manipulation. When dealing with Beijing, he warned, Trump would \u201cspeak softly but carry a big stick\u201d. This week\u2019s Foreign Policy article continues in a similar vein. It accuses Obama of having \u201cinvited Chinese aggression\u201d with his weak attempt to counterbalance Beijing\u2019s regional influence and claims the outgoing president was guilty of \u201ctalking loudly but carrying a small stick\u201d.  Trump would \u201csteadfastly pursue a strategy of peace through strength\u201d while ditching the economic heart of Obama\u2019s \u201cpivot\u201d towards Asia, the TPP. By rebuilding the US navy, which the authors describe as the \u201cgreat source of regional stability in Asia\u201d, Trump\u2019s US would remain \u201cguarantor of the liberal order in Asia\u201d. Chinese experts have gleefully latched on to Trump\u2019s campaign threats to turn away from longstanding security pacts with its regional rivals Japan and South Korea. Shen Dingli said he believed the US\u2019 new leader would not only scrap the TPP but would \u201cbring US forces in Japan and Korea home, rather than dispatching aircraft carriers to the South China Sea\u201d. Haenle, however, said the advisers\u2019 article suggested the Chinese were misreading Trump\u2019s willingness to retreat.  \u201cOne of the things they think is that Trump is going to draw inwards \u2026 which they obviously see as good for China. [But] I\u2019m not sure he is going to withdraw from the region as they think about it. His advisers are writing about not just maintaining a US military presence but actually enhancing that military presence \u2026 The idea that we are going to pull back somehow from our alliance relationships \u2013 I don\u2019t necessarily think that is going to be the case.\u201d Bill Bishop, another seasoned China watcher, said a significant recalibration of US-China ties had been likely no matter who had won the election because of a \u201cbuilding bipartisan backlash\u201d against China on issues such as trade, cybersecurity, Beijing\u2019s perceived lack of cooperation on North Korea and its island building spree in the South China Sea. \u201cBut what is sort of scary is that, whereas under president Clinton we had a pretty good idea of what her policy would be, under Trump it\u2019s sort of like Pekingology, trying to read the tea leaves. Trump has said so many different things it is hard to know what is really going to happen.\u201d Bishop said he was skeptical that Trump and Xi would strike \u201ca broader grand US-China bargain\u201d.  \u201cBut, at the same time, I certainly hope that we do everything we have to avoid actually creating conflict with the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d he said. \u201cThat risk is not small and if the US gets more aggressive in its operations in the East China Sea and the South China or brings the Taiwan issue back into the equation [then] the risks of conflict \u2026 are higher than they have been in a very long time.\u201d Schell said he sensed US-China relations were on the verge of a new era but accepted the approach of his country\u2019s new commander-in-chief was \u201ccompletely mysterious and very difficult to predict\u201d. \u201cFor all we know Trump could show up in Pyongyang with Kim Jong-un saying, \u2018Let\u2019s make a deal\u2019.\u201d First, though, he would take his \u201cCelebrity Apprentice mentality\u201d on board Air Force One for direct flights to Moscow and Beijing.  \u201cHe wants to go to the biggest, brassiest leaders of the world and that is, of course, China and Putin. He wants to swagger into these countries and show that his acumen is not policy, its not experience, it is, \u2018Let\u2019s make a deal\u2019. That is what he has got going for him, that is what he prides himself on and I think that is what he is going to do.\u201d \u201cTrump has this grandiose notion of his ability to make a deal. And his deals don\u2019t normally trifle with such things as human rights [or] American values.\u201d For China\u2019s embattled community of activists, already reeling from what some describe as the worst crackdown since Tiananmen, their likely abandonment is a major blow.  \u201cI cannot accept the result,\u201d said Li Maizi, a prominent feminist who received Clinton\u2019s support when she was hauled into detention last year during a police crackdown.  That powerful ally has now gone, vanquished by a populist insurgent whose threat to throw his presidential opponent in jail owed more to Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution than James Madison\u2019s bill of rights.  \u201cI cannot believe my eyes,\u201d added Li. \u201cI never could have imagined this kind of person could become president.\u201d Additional reporting by Christy Yao "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/18/the-wangs-vs-the-world-by-jade-chang-review", "publicationDate": "2016-11-18T15:00:20Z", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Charles, like many an immigrant parent, has spared his children the darker stories from his country\u2019s past \u2013 his family fleeing from the violence of China\u2019s Little Red Guard, his landowning father\u2019s humiliating resettlement in Taiwan."], "title": "The Wangs Vs the World by Jade Chang review \u2013 a richly entertaining debut", "article": "When facing personal disaster, people often have a powerful desire to hit the road. American fiction has a rich history of road trips as escape, whether characters are on the lam, like Humbert Humbert, or fleeing society\u2019s strictures and their broken prospects, as in Dave Eggers\u2019 recent novel Heroes of the Frontier, the tale of a single mother taking an RV around the wild stretches of Alaska. For Charles Wang, the jovial patriarch of Jade Chang\u2019s richly entertaining debut, the drive across country from Los Angeles is both a flight and a reckoning. Wang, a multimillionaire founder of a makeup empire, has lost everything after a business expansion fails and the bank calls in its loan. His ageing amah, who nursed Charles himself in China and later his American children, returns to Charles the 1980 Mercedes he gifted her years before; in this comical vehicle Charles and his second wife, Barbra, collect Grace from boarding school and Andrew from college (neither child\u2019s tuition being now affordable), then head eastwards to upstate New York and the farmhouse recently bought by his oldest daughter Saina, on proceeds from her art career. The year is 2008, the economy is imploding, and a transformative election campaign is under way. \u201cAll. Baba lost all,\u201d is how Charles puts it to Saina on the phone, explaining the loss of his Bel-Air mansion, his speedboat, his eight factories. \u201cWan le. You understand what that means? Everything over.\u201d Chang threads often untranslated Mandarin phrases through these pages, a nicely uncompromising touch that allows the Wangs to communicate privately. Charles\u2019s children, American in their ambitions and sensibilities \u2013 Andrew hopes for a career in standup comedy, while 16-year-old Grace has a style blog \u2013 must also navigate their attitudes to being Chinese-American, and to the country of their father\u2019s birth. The novel\u2019s poignant structure gradually emerges: the Wang family are not just reuniting in the US, but will together look to China, where their father is determined to discover what he may have left behind. Charles, like many an immigrant parent, has spared his children the darker stories from his country\u2019s past \u2013 his family fleeing from the violence of China\u2019s Little Red Guard, his landowning father\u2019s humiliating resettlement in Taiwan. Charles is a wonderfully drawn character, whose success and wealth in America have allowed him to suppress the privations of his childhood, and even move beyond the death of his first wife in a helicopter crash, when their youngest, Grace, was just an infant. Until this financial crisis, he has felt lucky. Chapters alternate between the perspectives of Saina in rural New York and Charles, Andrew, Grace and occasionally Barbra as they traverse the country, having various misadventures. Chang\u2019s tone is gently ironic toward Charles\u2019s financial collapse, as she enjoys chronicling the absurd excesses of the privileged Bel-Air life he must relinquish, or the high-end art world Saina used to inhabit. \u201cAll of her New York friends seemed to be locked in some perpetual work/party circuit that ran from Sundance to TED to Spring Fashion Week to Fire Island weekends to Burning Man to Fall Fashion Week to Art Basel Miami, with interludes of detox in Tulum or Marrakesh.\u201d    If Chang\u2019s smart and engaging novel remains defiantly cheerful it is perhaps because it is ultimately about love    Nonetheless, when the bustling narrative pauses over the bigger picture of 2008\u2019s global recession and its ravages, Chang captures the real pain in those stories, too: \u201cAll across the country, one by one, foreclosed house by shuttered business, in cold bedrooms and empty boardrooms and cars turned into homes, people had the same thoughts. I couldn\u2019t rescue myself. I will never win \u2026 I alone among all people am most uniquely cursed.\u201d Without being didactic, Chang underscores the fact that Charles\u2019s failure is part of \u201ca great populist uprising of failure in the face of years of shared success\u201d. In spite of the losses suffered by Charles and his children \u2013 Saina has had to confront a sharp professional fall when a political show of hers was seen as offensive, and her fiance left her; Andrew continues to be hapless in romance, and to bomb on the comedy circuit \u2013 Chang\u2019s smart and engaging novel remains defiantly cheerful. Perhaps this is because its ultimate subject, across a colourful span of geographies and cultural settings, is love. Charles is a vividly doting father, even dour stepmother Barbra has her good side, and the Wang children have a jaunty, authentic vibe of sibling connection in their humour and their resilience. A novel that begins as a road trip turns finally into a roots trip. The Wangs may have lost their fortune but they have gained a new set of Chinese relatives whom they meet in a late, climactic banquet, where they feast on stewed chicken testicles, turtle soup and other delicacies, enjoying the \u201cjangle of this unfamiliar homeland\u201d while knowing they will in the end return, altered, to their American home. \u2022 Sylvia Brownrigg\u2019s The Delivery Room is published by Picador."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/22/turmoil-east-asia-region-unsettled-trump", "publicationDate": "2016-11-22T05:54:17Z", "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan", "US news", "Donald Trump"], "sentences": ["Another potential flashpoint is Taiwan."], "title": "Turmoil in east Asia: sensitive moment for region unsettled by Trump", "article": "Political turmoil in South Korea, where President Park Geun-hye is facing noisy calls for her impeachment, comes at a particularly sensitive moment for security in east Asia, where North Korea\u2019s menacing nuclear weapons and missile development programmes are advancing unchecked.    Related: World leaders to seek pointers from Shinzo Abe meeting with Donald Trump    The rogue regime in Pyongyang led by the youthful dictator, Kim Jong-un, conducted another illegal missile test shortly before the US presidential election on 8 November.  While reportedly unsuccessful, it was the regime\u2019s fifth ballistic missile firing in two months, and followed its fifth and biggest nuclear test explosion in September. South Korea\u2019s army chiefs responded angrily, indicating they were ready to hit back.  \u201cOur military strongly condemns North Korea for continuously conducting illegal provocative acts and are thoroughly prepared for any possibility of additional provocation,\u201d an official statement said. But concern is growing that, at this critical juncture, South Korea\u2019s foremost ally is at best distracted, or at worst, may not longer be reliable.  Like their counterparts in Japan, South Korea\u2019s leaders have been un-nerved by statements by Donald Trump, US president-elect, that the two countries should pay more for their own defence.  South Korea pays about $860m a year towards the cost of stationing 28,000 American troops. Under a bilateral security treaty, Japan, where 50,000 US personnel are based, pays about $2bn a year.  Like some kind of mafia chieftain running a protection racket, Trump appears to be demanding money with menaces.  Trump also suggested at one point in the presidential campaign that South Korea and Japan acquire their own nuclear weapons to deter North Korea. This idea runs directly contrary to years of global counter-proliferation efforts. It is also deeply offensive to Japanese people, the only victims to date of a nuclear attack.  What Trump may do, in practice, about North Korea is unknown. But the Obama administration is not waiting to see. Earlier this month, John Kerry, the US secretary of state, pledged to deploy a defensive missile system known as Thaad (terminal high altitude area defence) in South Korea \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.  Thaad is designed to shoot down incoming ballistic missiles. Japan is upping its game, too. Earlier this year Tokyo said it was planning to acquire a wider range of ship-borne interceptors, upgrading two of its maritime self-defence force\u2019s six Aegis frigates and building two more. It may also deploy the Thaad system.  Unsurprisingly, North Korea has condemned these developments \u2013 but so, too, has China. It says the anti-missile systems will disturb the regional balance of power and could be used to undermine its own defences. Russia has made similar objections regarding Nato missile deployments in Poland, and has responded in kind in Kaliningrad. China\u2019s displeasure may stoke wider tensions with the US and its regional allies. Washington has been critical of Beijing\u2019s failure to rein in North Korea. Although China has supported UN sanctions against Pyongyang and condemned its nuclear explosions, it has not applied its unique economic leverage to make Kim back off.    Related: Donald Trump to 'withdraw from Trans-Pacific Partnership' on day one    It is likely that Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, views the North Korean conundrum in the broader context of his efforts to thwart Obama\u2019s so-called pivot to Asia and assert Chinese regional dominance at US expense.  One front in this escalating war for power and influence is the South China Sea, where China is building military bases on disputed islands despite a UN court ruling that its activities are illegal. Another potential flashpoint is Taiwan. Xi is squeezing the island\u2019s newly-elected president whom he suspects of pursuing a pro-independence agenda.  China is also challenging Japan is a separate island dispute in the East China Sea. Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s conservative prime minister who is frequently assailed by official Chinese media, last week became the first foreign leader to meet Trump. Abe wanted to gauge the election victor\u2019s intentions in east Asia. He declared afterwards that Trump could be trusted. But Abe\u2019s verdict will not prevent supporters of moves to \u201cre-interpret\u201d the post-war pacifist constitution and expand Japan\u2019s independent defence capabilities from using current tensions with China and North Korea, and continuing doubts about Trump, to justify accelerated Japanese rearmament.  Shigeru Ishiba, a former defence minister who is tipped as a possible successor to Abe, suggested on Monday it was not unreasonable for Trump to want Tokyo to do more to render the US-Japan alliance more effective. \u201cIn the future, this structure should change,\u201d he said. In Japan\u2019s cautious political parlance, that amounts to a call to arms.

Jason Dedrick, a professor at Syracuse University\u2019s School of Information Studies, analyzed Apple\u2019s supply chain for the MIT Technology Review and found that assembling iPhones in the US would add between $30 to $40 to the product\u2019s cost, largely due to labor costs and the additional cost of shipping components to the US.  Dedrick\u2019s estimate did not include the capital cost outlay of building factories, which could be substantial.

Almost two years after ceremonial ground was broken on the Grand Transoceanic Canal of Nicaragua, the actual soil remains obdurately undisturbed by anything other than grazing cattle. There is no machinery, no noise, no activity.  Instead of legions of construction workers, the only people to be seen are a farming family sheltering on porch hammocks from the midday sun, and a couple of guards manning a gate on the rutted dirt track down to the river. Yet contrary to the languid scene, local people have never been more convinced that the controversial mega-project is finally about to begin.   Related: Land of opportunity \u2013 and fear \u2013 along route of Nicaragua\u2019s giant new canal    In recent weeks, they say, engineers have conducted geological surveys and marked up the area, farmers have been paid $3,000 to allow surveys of their land, and more than 500 acres have been purchased by the Chinese developer HKND for road-widening. \u201cThe company is absolutely serious. We had a big meeting last month and they told everyone, don\u2019t plant anything or build anything because you will only be compensated for the land,\u201d said Brito shopkeeper Manuel Cruz. \u201cThey said they would start work on a pier within 15 days and bring in lots of workers in December or January.\u201d Jos\u00e9 Mena, a farmer, said Chinese engineers had visited within the last month to bore holes and take readings at several points across his property. Mena said they used drilling machinery that was stored near the proposed construction site for the port, which is now guarded 24 hours a day. Earlier this year, the developers also came to talk to him about land appropriation. \u201cI don\u2019t mind if it goes ahead as long as they do it well. They should not do too much damage and they should ensure that people get proper compensation,\u201d he said.     Residents shout slogans during a protest march against the construction of the planned interoceanic canal, in San Jorge, Nicaragua, on 3 October 2014. Photograph: Esteban Felix/AP    The uptick in activity at Brito suggests the project \u2013 which many had assumed to have been killed off by funding problems, local opposition and environmental concerns \u2013 may be about to move out of a dormant phase, though whether it gets much further may depend more on politics than finance or engineering. Conceived by the government of Daniel Ortega, pushed through parliament in 2014 with almost no debate and backed by HKND, a mysterious Chinese company, the proposed $50bn waterway was envisaged as a superior rival to the Panama Canal. Designers say the biggest earth-moving operation in history will clear a 178-mile long, 30-metre wide channel so that even the world\u2019s largest ships can pass through the isthmus between the Pacific and the Atlantic. But it has been dogged by doubts and opposition. Shipping experts have questioned the viability of the project. The president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, last month described the rival canal as \u201cmore speculation than reality\u201d. Thousands of landowners along the route have rallied against the appropriation of their property. Unlike in Brito, there are no signs that the project is moving ahead in areas of strong protest. \u201cThe last time the Chinese came was two years ago when some people here threw stones at their car and broke a window. Since then, nothing\u2019s happened,\u201d said Elizabeth del Carmen, a resident of Obrajuelo, which is where the canal is supposed to enter the western side of Lake Nicaragua.       Conservationists warn the dredging and perhaps also blasting of the lake could cause immense damage to ecosystems and freshwater supplies. After an environmental impact assessment by London-based ERM urged further studies on the Atlantic coast and called for the relocation of the Pacific port, the developer announced a one-year delay.  Wang Jing, the Chinese telecoms tycoon behind the project, lost about 85% of his fortune in a stock market crash, and has not visited Nicaragua for a year, fuelling suspicions that the project may be dead.

I have no reason to doubt it,\u201d the president of the canal commission, Manuel Coronel Kautz, told the Guardian. \u201cAccording to our schedule, we should initiate major works by the end of the year.\u201d He said operations would begin in the next couple of months to build a deepwater dock at Brito, and that a deal had already been struck between HKND and Nicaraguan labour unions to supply 5,000 workers for the initial stages. Local opposition, he said, would fade once property owners were offered compensation. HKND is said to have agreed to a total compensation budget of $300-400m to be shared among the 30,000 people along the route of the canal. But there is a disagreement between the Nicaraguan authorities and HKND about the timing of the payments, he admitted. \u201cWe want them to pay everyone at once. But they want to do it stage by stage,\u201d Coronel said. For some critics, this raises the possibility that HKND may not go ahead with the full project, but instead use their concession to build ports and other developments on a piecemeal basis. \u201cWe believe the canal law creates a state within a state. It allows the expropriation of land to launder ill-gotten funds on projects that are outside the jurisdiction of the authorities,\u201d said Violeta Granera, whose civil society group, Movimiento Por Nicaragua, has supported the opposition movement by affected campesinos and demanded greater transparency. The biggest unanswered question is the extent to which the Chinese government is supporting the project.

That is how politics works there,\u201d he said. Wang, who has never previously been involved in an engineering project on this scale, has denied being a proxy for the Chinese government or military. But without Beijing\u2019s approval and financial backing, many observers feel it is unlikely the project will be able to move ahead. \u201cIf the People\u2019s Republic of China does not step forward, it won\u2019t happen. Wang Jing does not have the reputation to push this through. If it is just him, then the chances of this happening are zero. If the PRC steps in, then it is a big possibility,\u201d said Carlos Fernando Chamorro, editor of the Confidencial newspaper.   Related: $50bn Nicaragua canal postponed as Chinese tycoon's fortunes falter    Nicaragua has diplomatic relations with Taiwan rather than China, which makes it politically difficult for Beijing to become overtly involved. Coronel, who was formerly deputy foreign minister, recently sent a memo to Ortega suggesting that this policy be changed in order to improve the logistics of flying in specialists and equipment. But even if the two countries formalise diplomatic ties and the Chinese government facilitates the canal project, Coronel admits they must still overcome an even bigger political obstacle. \u201cThe only problem we see is what the US says about China coming into a small country in their area of influence. That\u2019s something I doubt,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want it, it will be difficult.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/25/martin-scorsese-silence-premiere-vatican-jesuit-missionaries-japan", "publicationDate": "2016-11-25T14:29:12Z", "tags": ["Silence", "Martin Scorsese", "Vatican", "Catholicism", "Christianity", "Religion", "World news", "Film", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Finally, filming began last year in Taiwan."], "title": "Martin Scorsese\u2019s Silence to premiere at the Vatican", "article": "There will be no red carpet, and almost certainly none of the usual glamour. But when Martin Scorsese\u2019s new film, Silence, has its world premiere at the Vatican on Tuesday, it will be the culmination of a 27-year project that the director has described as \u201can obsession\u201d. Pope Francis is not expected to attend the screening at the Pontifical Oriental Institute for the Jesuits, but Scorsese will join about 400 priests and other guests to watch the 159-minute movie. The director may meet the pontiff separately. A two-minute trailer released this week suggested a film of much anguish and violence. It has already been tipped as an Oscar contender, an accolade for which Scorsese has been nominated a dozen times and won once, in 2007 for The Departed. Silence is based on the acclaimed 1966 novel of the same name by the Japanese author Shusaku Endo. It is the 17th-century story of two Portuguese Jesuit missionaries, Rodrigues and Garrpe \u2013 played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver \u2013 who travel to Japan to track down their mentor, Father Ferreira.   Related: Will the Catholic church ever earn women\u2019s forgiveness? | Joanna Moorhead    At the time, Christianity was banned in Japan, and those who practised the faith were tortured and executed. Faced with this, Ferreira (played by Liam Neeson) apparently renounced his religion through a ritual known as fumie \u2013 in which Christians were forced to trample over a religious icon such as a crucifix in order to prove repudiation of their faith. Tens of thousands of Japanese Christians were persecuted, tortured and killed over the 250 years that the religion was outlawed. The ban was lifted in 1873, but Christians are still a tiny minority \u2013 less than 1% \u2013 in a country dominated by Shinto and Buddhism. In Silence, the two priests end up in the same situation as Ferreira. Rodrigues is forced to choose between apostasy and death \u2013 not just his own, but the execution of converts. He prays for guidance but God is silent, until at last he hears a single word: \u201ctrample\u201d.     Scorsese directing Adam Garfield during the filming of Silence. Photograph: Paramount    Scorsese read Endo\u2019s novel in 1989, a year after his film The Last Temptation of Christ triggered a storm of controversy over a dream sequence in which Jesus has sex with Mary Magdalene. Religious themes and subtexts have run through other movies made by Scorsese, who considered the priesthood as a youngster. The director was determined to turn the novel into a movie (a Japanese film version appeared in 1971, which Endo apparently considered a travesty of his book), but the project ran into repeated difficulties and delays. Finally, filming began last year in Taiwan. Three years ago, Scorsese told the online movie magazine Deadline that his quest to make the film had been an obsession. Saying he had been \u201csteeped in the Roman Catholic religion\u201d as a young man, he added: \u201cAs you get older, ideas come and go. Questions, answers, loss of the answer again and more questions, and this is what really interests me \u2026   Related: The nun harnessing Twitter to spread her message to the masses    \u201cSilence is just something I\u2019m drawn to in that way. It\u2019s been an obsession, it has to be done and now is the time to do it. It\u2019s a strong, wonderful true story, a thriller in a way, but it deals with those questions.\u201d Scorsese hired the Rev James Martin, a Jesuit priest and writer, as a consultant, and his stars prepared themselves for their roles by undertaking a seven-day silent retreat at St Beuno\u2019s, a Jesuit spiritual centre with spectacular views of Snowdonia in north Wales. \u201cAndrew [Garfield] got to the point where he could out-Jesuit a Jesuit,\u201d Martin told the New York Times. \u201cThere were places in the script where he would stop and say, \u2018A Jesuit wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019, and we would come up with something else.\u201d           Silence trailer: Martin Scorsese\u2019s Japan-set epic starring Andrew Garfield \u2013 video    Mark Williams, professor of Japanese studies at Leeds University and an expert on Endo\u2019s novels, said the main theme of Silence was the unique nature of each individual\u2019s spiritual journey. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get this across in a film, but if anyone can do it, it\u2019s Scorsese,\u201d he said.   Related: Martin Scorsese film recalls martyrdom of Japan's hidden Christians    A key test would be how the director handled the final section of the book, following the climactic scene in which Rodrigues \u201cbetrays everything his life has stood for\u201d. In the novel, the priest is overtaken by guilt and does not abandon his faith but spends the rest of his life in and out of prison. The book had sold well in Japan, although the \u201chardcore Catholic community view it as heretical and blasphemous\u201d, said Williams. \u201cEndo was persona non grata among Japanese Catholics. You can\u2019t find the book in any Christian bookshops, but it\u2019s widely talked about in Japan \u2013 and I\u2019m sure the film will be popular.\u201d Silence opens in the US on 23 December, in the UK on 1 January and in Japan later that month. It is not the first film to have a Vatican premiere. The Pope Francis biopic Call Me Francesco was first shown there last December to an audience of refugees and homeless, and in 2006 Catherine Hardwicke\u2019s The Nativity Story had its world premiere at the Vatican.

Surfers flock to Taiwan, an island nation that fears the sea", "article": "Set against a backdrop of lush green mountains sweeping down to a Pacific ocean swell, the village of Jinzun Harbour reminds some surfers of old-school Hawaii. It is quite a claim to make about this quiet fishing community, and not just because it has only a nascent surfing scene. This village is in Taiwan, an island nation that for generations has had an unusual fear of the sea. Yet last week Jinzun came alive as more than 200 surfers arrived to compete in Taiwan\u2019s fifth Open of Surfing, a World Surf League qualifying series event with a $50,000 prize purse. Riding the waves under grey, stormy skies, international competitors described the surf as world-class, its optimum swells created by seasonal typhoons. On shore, tent stalls offered mouth-watering fried fish and aboriginal millet wine beside the palm-fringed fishing harbour. As rain swept down over the mountains on the opening day, barefoot, sun-bleached Californian surfers mingled with bemused locals in raincoats.     Jinzin harbour has a mountainous backdrop that reminded some of Hawaii.

The crowd of spectators was small and convivial, with local families bringing their children to enjoy the performance. The contest concludes on Sunday and is viewed as an excellent warm-up event for the longboard championship in Hainan, China, in December. Surfing is still new to Taiwan, an island of 23 million off the east coast of China. Fewer than 100 people make a living out of surfing. A high rate of drowning deaths has helped create nationwide trepidation but analysts say the aversion to water has cultural and political roots going back to the island\u2019s tempestuous relationship with China.  Jonathan Spangler, from the Asia Pacific Policy Research Association in the Taiwanese capital, Taipei says: \u201cIn the education system here it\u2019s taught that swimming in the ocean is dangerous, don\u2019t go swimming.\u201d  Dr Francis Hu, head of political science at Tunghai university, Taichung, explains that for decades, post-second world war Taiwan had also restricted access to the coastline for security reasons. Although it has its own government, Taiwan is viewed by China as a renegade province that will eventually reunite with the mainland, a status that has created flashpoints in recent history.

We didn\u2019t allow people to have private ships,\u201d says Hu. \u201cFor a long time ... we didn\u2019t allow ordinary people to pursue their maritime activities on most of the coastline.\u201d    About half of my students can\u2019t swim  Francis Hu, Tunghai university     As a result, there is a generational gap in knowledge about the sea. \u201cAbout half of my students can\u2019t swim,\u201d he said. This deep-rooted fear is starting to change thanks to people like Baybay Niu, one of Taiwan\u2019s best-known female surfers. Niu, 41, helped to pioneer the sport, a feat which is doubly unusual for a woman in a conservative Asian society that cherishes pale, not beach-bronzed, skin. Niu now lives in Jinzun where she has set up a surf school for children. The sport was so alien when she arrived 10 years ago that she had to explain to shocked grandparents that her bikini was swimwear. \u201cThey thought I wasn\u2019t wearing any clothes,\u201d she laughs.       Niu introduced the idea of water safety to a community who viewed it as a danger to their children. \u201cSo many of their family had perhaps died when they went fishing, so they were scared about the ocean, scared about letting their grandkids go in,\u201d she said.

They were mesmerised and cheering as surfers from as far afield as Indonesia, Australia and the US danced across the waves. This generation is likely to have a better understanding of water than previous ones. International surfers see great potential in Taiwan\u2019s growing surf culture. The violent typhoons that slam into the eastern seaboard every year ironically also makes the surf more marketable.

The four-yearly Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (Timss) found that the performance of English pupils in the benchmark tests taken last year were remarkably similar to what it was in 2011. England\u2019s 13 and 14-year-olds produced their best effort in science, where England\u2019s international rank rose from ninth to eighth out of the 39 countries taking part, keeping England ahead of the US, Canada and Australia. But England\u2019s improved rank in science was mainly due to Finland not entering pupils in that age group, after having been the best-performing European country in 2011. Although the latest Timss results didn\u2019t show statistically significant improvements, they were enough for England to be ranked among the countries showing the best sustained improvements in science since the international measure was introduced in 1995.

Robert Coe, professor of education at the University of Durham, said: \u201cThese look like a respectable set of results for England.

In science, the primary school age group scored 536, up by seven points compared with 2011, and the 13 to 14-year-olds scored 537, an improvement of four points. Northern Ireland, which only took part in the assessment of younger children, was 24 points ahead of England in maths, but did less well in science, where it was 16 points behind England. School standards minister Nick Gibb welcomed the Timss results and said he expected even stronger results in future international tests following the introduction of a more demanding primary maths curriculum in 2014. \u201cWe know maths and science are highly valued by employers and are linked to higher earnings,\u201d he said. \u201cToday\u2019s results show our pupils are more engaged and confident in both subjects compared with some of the top performing countries. \u201cMastering these skills will ensure there is no limit to a pupil\u2019s ambition and will ensure our future workforce has the skills to drive the future productivity and economy for this country.\u201d Peter Weir, Northern Ireland\u2019s minister for education, said the Timss results showed progress from a strong maths performance in 2011. \u201cThe vast majority of children have parents with a positive attitude towards mathematics and science,\u201d Weir said. \u201cIn addition, our principals and teachers were reported to have some of the highest levels of emphasis on academic success.\u201d Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers welcomed the improvements in performance is English schools. He added: \u201cSadly however, this report makes it clear that problems with teacher recruitment are holding England back from the premier division of international performance. \u201cSchools leaders in England are more likely to report that maths and science vacancies are difficult to fill than the other countries included in this report. Around two thirds of year 9 pupils were taught in schools where vacancies in both maths and science were either somewhat or very difficult to fill.\u201d Hobby said the report also highlighted concerns over teacher retention. \u201cStudents in England are more likely to be taught by teachers with fewer years of experience than the average. \u201cEngland\u2019s teachers are more likely to report challenging teaching conditions such as too many teaching hours and difficulty keeping up with curriculum changes. Job satisfaction among teachers in England is low compared to teachers in most other countries. All of which has a measurable impact on student attainment.\u201d The Timss scores are the first of two international benchmarks to be published within a week. On 6 December, the latest version of the OECD\u2019s triennial Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) will be published, providing a further measure of literacy, maths and science in England as well as Scotland and Wales. The 2015 Pisa results will include London\u2019s figures, available separately for the first time, which will reveal any differences between 15-year-olds in the capital and elsewhere in the UK."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/29/elaine-chao-trump-transportation-secretary-nominee", "publicationDate": "2016-11-29T17:08:38Z", "tags": ["Trump administration", "US politics", "Republicans", "US news"], "sentences": ["\u201cShe has an amazing life story and has helped countless Americans in her public service career.\u201d The Trump transition team statement emphasized Chao\u2019s personal history as an immigrant from Taiwan.", "\u201cSecretary Chao\u2019s experience transitioning to a new country has motivated her to devote most of her professional life to ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to build better lives.\u201d Chao, who was born in Taiwan and is the wife of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, also served as deputy secretary of transportation and director of the Peace Corps in the administration of George HW Bush."], "title": "Elaine Chao nominated as Trump's transportation secretary", "article": "Donald Trump has nominated former labor secretary Elaine Chao to be his transportation secretary, the campaign announced on Tuesday.

As has also become normal in the \u201cpost-truth\u201d aftermath of the bitter election, the facts surrounding his telephone conversation with Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen are in dispute. Reacting to the wave of alarm caused by the call, upending 37 years of US diplomatic practice in a few minutes, the president-elect protested in a tweet that it was Tsai who had called him, implying he just happened to pick up the phone.    Related: Donald Trump's phone call with Taiwan president risks China's wrath    According to the Taipei Times however, the call had been orchestrated by the Trump transition team, several members of which have strong leanings towards a more pro-Taiwan policy. On the same day as the call, Trump met John Bolton, a former US ambassador to the UN, a candidate for the secretary of state job, and a fierce advocate of stronger commitment to Taiwan as a way of exacting a price for China\u2019s increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea and elsewhere.  Bolton wrote in the Wall Street Journal in January: \u201cThe new US administration could start with receiving Taiwanese diplomats officially at the State Department; upgrading the status of US representation in Taipei from a private \u2018institute\u2019 to an official diplomatic mission; inviting Taiwan\u2019s president to travel officially to America; allowing the most senior US officials to visit Taiwan to transact government business; and ultimately restoring full diplomatic recognition.\u201d Stephen Yates, a former White House aide to Dick Cheney now advising the Trump transition was in Taiwan at the time of the call. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have a leader willing to ignore those who say he cannot take a simple call from another democratically elected leader,\u201d Yates tweeted. The third now familiar transition theme illustrated by the Taiwan call is that it is unclear where Trump\u2019s business interests end and his presidential intentions begin. A Trump representative had reportedly visited the north-west city of Taoyuan to inspect investment opportunities at a new luxury development there. And the president-elect\u2019s son Eric Trump is expected in Taiwan on business next year. As is bound to happen in relations with the 20 or so countries around the world where the Trump Organisation has business interests \u2013 unless Trump decides to sell his holdings and set up a genuine blind trust \u2013 decisions will have both commercial and geopolitical implications and it will be hard to disentangle one from another.  Isaac Stone Fish, a senior fellow at the Asia Society\u2019s Centre on US-China Relations, said it mattered whether the call was a careless gaffe or well-prepared provocation, especially when it came to Beijing\u2019s perceptions.  \u201cI don\u2019t know whether Trump and his advisers understood the unprecedented nature of this phone call, or how much he debated the effect this may have with his advisers beforehand,\u201d Fish said in an email. \u201cBut the issue of whether or not they knew is hugely important. It helps determine how much trust and respect Americans, and governments around the world, should have in Trump and his team\u2019s competence in handling US foreign policy \u2013 if he and his team didn\u2019t know this would cause a stir, then they deserve less respect and trust.\u201d  He added: \u201cIt\u2019s far more worrying for global stability if Beijing believes that Trump and his advisers just didn\u2019t understand US policy towards Taiwan. If they view this as a blunder, they could decide to move quickly to exploit Trump\u2019s inexperience and incompetence in foreign affairs, and Obama\u2019s lame-duck status.\u201d  Christopher Hill, a former assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs said in a tweet the call looked to be an \u201cexample of winging it in the extreme\u201d and he said he hoped \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t feel he has to double down on this judgment error.\u201d   That is what appeared to be happening late on Friday, as new battle lines were drawn around the call. The president-elect defended his decision saying that the US sells Taiwan \u201cbillions of dollars of military equipment\u201d, and his aide Kellyanne Conway, insisted he was \u201cwell aware of what US policy has been\u201d toward Taiwan.   Republicans piled in on Trump\u2019s side. Senator Tom Cotton, issued a statement saying: \u201cI commend President-elect Trump for his conversation with President Tsai Ing-wen, which reaffirms our commitment to the only democracy on Chinese soil.\u201d Democratic senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut argued that, even if Trump wanted to change US policy, this was no way to do it.  \u201cWhat has happened in the last 48 hours is not a shift. These are major pivots in foreign policy [without] any plan. That\u2019s how wars start,\u201d Murphy tweeted. \u201cAnd if they aren\u2019t pivots \u2013 just radical temporary deviations \u2013 allies will walk if they have no clue what we stand for. Just as bad.\u201d  Aaron Friedberg, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University, said he was an advocate of closer ties with Taiwan but said \u201cthis seems ill-considered [and] pointlessly provocative\u201d.  \u201cStrategy involves thinking more than one move ahead. No evidence of that here,\u201d Friedberg said, adding that whatever the circumstances of the call, Beijing was more likely to see it as a deliberate provocation and a test than a blunder.

In a second tweet addressing criticism of the call Trump wrote:     Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016    Bishop said it was hard to know whether the call was the result of a deliberate policy move by Trump or merely an intervention by a member of his staff who was friendly towards Tsai Ing-wen and Taipei.  Trump adviser Peter Navarro, an economics professor, travelled to Taiwan in the first half of this year at the invitation of its ministry of foreign affairs.  In a recent article for Foreign Policy magazine, Navarro said Barack Obama\u2019s treatment of Taiwan had been \u201cegregious\u201d, adding: \u201cThis beacon of democracy in Asia is perhaps the most militarily vulnerable US partner anywhere in the world.\u201d Paul Haenle, the head of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre in Beijing, said the call would serve as \u201ca reality check\u201d for many in Beijing who had expected Trump would be transactional and pragmatic leader who might begin a US retreat from Asia and would not challenge China on issues such as human rights. Trump\u2019s unpredictable moves now threatened to inject fresh uncertainty into Washington-Beijing ties.  \u201cFormer president George W. Bush, who I worked for as China director on the National Security Council staff, always operated from a principle of \u2018no surprises\u2019, which he believed was a key stabilising feature in the relationship with China,\u201d said Haenle, a veteran US diplomat.  \u201cThe alternative \u2013 catching China by surprise on some of the most sensitive and longstanding areas of disagreement in our relationship \u2013 presents enormous risks and potential detriment for this consequential relationship.\u201d  Bishop said Beijing\u2019s immediate reaction would be a \u201crhetorical explosion\u201d but that the longer-term consequences were altogether more unpredictable. \u201cIf the US starts to change the \u2018one China\u2019 policy, that puts US-China relations into uncharted territory,\u201d he said.  Speaking to CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway defended the president-elect\u2019s unorthodox move.  \u201cI\u2019m pretty certain that president-elect Obama spoke to world leaders in preparation for taking over as commander-in-chief,\u201d she said. Pressed that Obama never broke with US diplomatic policy in this way, Conway said Trump was \u201cfully briefed and fully knowledgeable about these issues\u201d.   In a statement on Saturday morning, President Tsai\u2019s office confirmed that the call had taken place at 11pm local time on Friday, and that the conversation had lasted about 10 minutes.   Taiwan\u2019s National Security Council secretary general Joseph Wu, foreign minister David Lee, and acting secretary general Liu Shih-fang, were all present during the call.   The statement said Tsai congratulated the president-elect on his election and was certain his performance would be \u201coutstanding\u201d in office.   The two leaders exchanged \u201cviews and ideas\u201d about future governance, in particular focusing on economic development and \u201cstrengthening\u201d national defence.   They also discussed the regional situation in Asia and the strengthening of bilateral relations between Taiwan and the US, with Tsai expressing the hope that Washington would continue to support Taipei internationally. Reaction in Taiwan was muted on Saturday morning, with people completely taken by surprise, said analysts. \u201cObviously for Taiwan it\u2019s a good sign as some Taiwanese politicians were a bit worried that the Trump administration would ignore Taiwan,\u201d said Jonathan Spangler from the Taipei-based South China Sea think tank. The call could also help boost Tsai\u2019s ratings, which have plummeted in her first six months in office. \u201cIt shows that she does have the capacity and courage to lead Taiwan,\u201d said Spangler.  Beijing has been scrambling to understand what a Trump White House might mean for already fraught US-China relations since his election last month, with some predicting an unexpected rapprochement and others a trade war. On Friday Xi Jinping held a 90-minute meeting with Henry Kissinger, a longstanding go-between for Washington and Beijing, in the Chinese capital to discuss relations between the two countries.  According to Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, Xi told Kissinger: \u201cChina will work closely with the United States at a new starting point to maintain the smooth transition of ties and stable growth\u201d. \u201cThe two countries should properly handle their different views and divergences in a constructive manner,\u201d Xi reportedly added.  That relationship is likely to be come under sudden and renewed strain in the wake of Trump\u2019s call with Tsai.  \u201cThis adds a level of risk to US-China relations that we haven\u2019t seen in a very long time,\u201d said Bishop.  \u201cThis is the third rail of US-China relations. For Trump to come in and basically look like he is setting aside decades of US policy towards [China/Taiwan] relations has to be quite worrisome for them. There is a lot of uncertainty about what Trump is going to do.  \u201cIt\u2019s unclear who his advisers are, although certainly the ones who have been named have argued over the years for the US to change the relationship we have with Taiwan; to make the US-Taiwan relationship more important and upend the one China policy that we have had in place since the 1970s. So this could set off a lot of alarm bells in Beijing.\u201d In the lead-up to Friday\u2019s call with Tsai, Trump\u2019s team had reportedly been looking into the possibility of investing in luxury hotels in Taiwan.  In mid-November the mayor of Taoyuan, a city in northwest Taiwan, confirmed that a representative of the president-elect had flown into his city to examine business opportunities at Aerotropolis, a sprawling development of luxury waterside homes and industrial parks near its international airport.

Trump looked to have sparked a potentially damaging diplomatic row with Beijing on Friday after speaking to the Taiwanese president on the telephone.   Related: Trump's Taiwan phone call preceded by hotel development inquiry    The call, first reported by the Taipei Times and confirmed by the Financial Times, is thought to be the first between the leader of the island and a US president or president-elect since ties between the two countries were severed in 1979, at Beijing\u2019s behest. The US closed its embassy in Taiwan \u2013 a democratically ruled island which Beijing regards as a breakaway province \u2013 in the late 1970s after the historic rapprochement between Beijing and Washington that stemmed from Richard Nixon\u2019s 1972 trip to China. Since then the US has adhered to the \u201cOne China\u201d principle, which officially considers the independently governed island to be part of the same single Chinese nation as the mainland. Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, said in a statement on Saturday: \u201cIt must be pointed out that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The government of the People\u2019s Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing China.\u201d Geng added: \u201cThis is a fact that is generally recognised by the international community.\u201d The statement did not describe the details of China\u2019s complaint to the US, or say with whom it had been lodged. It said China urged \u201cthe relevant US side\u201d \u2013 implying Trump\u2019s incoming administration \u2013 to handle Taiwan-related issues \u201ccautiously and properly\u201d to avoid \u201cunnecessary interference\u201d in the China-US relationship. China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, sought to play down the importance of the conversation, dismissing it as a \u201cpetty action\u201d.  The Global Times, a government-controlled tabloid which sometimes echoes official views, took a harder line, using an editorial to warn Trump that he should think twice before destroying US-China relations by further engaging with Taiwan\u2019s government. \u201cIf Trump wants to overstep the One China principle, he will destroy Sino-US ties,\u201d the newspaper said. \u201cThat means the current pattern between Beijing and Washington, as well as international order, will be overturned. We believe this is not what Trump wants.\u201d The nationalist newspaper urged Taipei not to cross Beijing. \u201cIf the Taiwan government ever does anything to break the status quo, it must pay the price. Beijing should better communicate with Trump\u2019s team and be prepared to respond to Trump\u2019s moves after he assumes office,\u201d it said. In a more diplomatically worded article, Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, urged Trump not to damage the \u201cstability and maturity\u201d of US-China relations. \u201cChina and the United States are not destined rivals. They can be partners for peace if they do not veer off this course,\u201d it said.  The Global Times blamed the fact that Trump \u201cwas not familiar with foreign relations\u201d for his decision to hold a conversation with Tsai.   Related: Gaffe or provocation, Donald Trump's Taiwan phone call affects global stability    However, China experts believe Trump\u2019s unexpected decision to engage with Tsai was the result of advice from several influential advisers who are known for their hardline stances on China policy. They include Stephen Yates, a former aide to Dick Cheney, who defended Trump\u2019s telephone conversation on Twitter, writing: \u201cIt\u2019s great to have a leader willing to ignore those who say he cannot take a simple call from another democratically elected leader. Daniel Blumenthal, another Trump adviser, wrote on Twitter: \u201cMaybe folks hyperventilating over Trump-Tsai call will finally learn something about our important friendship with Taiwan.\u201d  Trump\u2019s transition team said Tsai, who became Taiwan\u2019s first female president in January, had congratulated the billionaire tycoon on his recent victory. \u201cDuring the discussion they noted the close economic, political and security ties that exist between Taiwan and the United States,\u201d a statement said. \u201cPresident-elect Trump also congratulated President Tsai on becoming president of Taiwan earlier this year.\u201d  China experts said Beijing would have been enraged by the unexpected move.  \u201cI would imagine Xi Jinping would be angry,\u201d said Bill Bishop, a veteran China watcher who runs the Sinocism newsletter from Washington DC. \u201cThis is going to make real waves in Beijing. I think we will see quite the reaction from Beijing \u2026 this will put relations from day one into a very difficult place.\u201d Evan Medeiros, the Asia director at the White House national security council, told the Financial Times: \u201cThe Chinese leadership will see this as a highly provocative action, of historic proportions. \u201cRegardless if it was deliberate or accidental, this phone call will fundamentally change China\u2019s perceptions of Trump\u2019s strategic intentions for the negative. With this kind of move, Trump is setting a foundation of enduring mistrust and strategic competition for US-China relations.\u201d In an indication that Trump\u2019s team had grasped the potential damage caused to relations with Beijing, the US president-elect later tweeted:     The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency.

The claims about Chen\u2019s visit, which were confirmed by the mayor\u2019s spokesman and the Aerotropolis corporation, add to growing concerns about potential conflicts of interest between Trump\u2019s business empire and US foreign policy. Although the president-elect has confirmed he will leave his conglomerate once he takes office, the decision to turn over the business to his children has raised fears that the family\u2019s financial ties with foreign players could shade US policy.  The Aerotropolis project is in the early stages of planning, with consultations continuing with residents who live close to the airport. The area marked out for development is largely made up of fields and small settlements. Building contracts are not expected to be granted for at least two years.

Trump\u2019s 10-minute call on Friday with Tsai was an unprecedented move that broke decades of US-China protocol and prompted Beijing to lodge a diplomatic complaint with the US.           China dismisses Trump call with Taiwan as \u2018small trick\u2019    Although Taiwan has its own government, currency and military, China views the island of 23 million as a province that will eventually be reunited with the mainland. It strongly objects to any country having formal diplomatic ties with Taipei. Since 1979, the US has acknowledged Beijing\u2019s claim that Taiwan is part of China, with relations governed by the \u201cOne China\u201d set of protocols. In Taiwan, both analysts and opposition leaders said they had been surprised by the call. \u201cSomebody called Tsai, the president of Taiwan, and that\u2019s good to hear,\u201d said Antonio Chang, a Taipei-based political analyst. \u201cBut people are worried about the backlash from China. On one hand people are happy and on the other they have a kind of angst.  \u201cPeople tend to forget that Taiwan is a country. It\u2019s not Hong Kong. This is a reminder for the world.\u201d   Related: Gaffe or provocation, Donald Trump's Taiwan phone call affects global stability    China has frozen ties with Taiwan because of Tsai\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the \u201cOne China\u201d policy since her inauguration in May. Given the tension with Beijing, some analysts questioned the wisdom of the Tsai administration\u2019s decision to go ahead with the call. Francis Hu, the head of politics at Taichung University, said it was not \u201cprudent\u201d to talk for so long and portray it as a diplomatic breakthrough in US-Taiwan relations. \u201cIf you want to call someone to offer congratulations this is not a mistake, but for other things, it may not be so prudent because we\u2019re now in a delicate situation,\u201d he said. Taiwan\u2019s main opposition Kuomintang party [KMT], which has traditionally taken a pro-China stance, expressed its reservations about the call in a statement released on Saturday. While welcoming US support, it urged Tsai\u2019s government, currently ruled by her Democratic Progressive party, to implement a \u201cno surprises\u201d foreign policy. Eric Huang, the KMT\u2019s international spokesman, said the party hoped the DPP \u201cwill implement foreign policies that consider regional and cross-strait political relations, have our country\u2019s best interests as the primary strategic consideration, rather than engage in events that merely offer foreign policy public relations value\u201d."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/03/nigel-farage-willing-to-serve-donald-trump-us-uk", "publicationDate": "2016-12-03T16:27:20Z", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "Nigel Farage", "US news", "US politics", "European Union", "World news", "Europe"], "sentences": ["Related: China lodges complaint with US over Trump's Taiwan phone call    \u201cI just happen to know a few people in his administration,\u201d the former UK Independence party leader told CNN on Saturday."], "title": "Nigel Farage is willing to serve Donald Trump 'formally or informally'", "article": "Nigel Farage has expressed a willingness to serve Donald Trump \u201cformally or informally\u201d in the pursuit of improved US-UK relations.

The \u2018one China\u2019 principle is the political foundation of China-US relations.\u201d A spokesman for the Obama administration declined to comment on the complaint. Trump\u2019s call with Tsai was the first publicly reported between a US president or president-elect and a leader of Taiwan since Washington established diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979.  The US subsequently severed ties with the island, which is viewed by Beijing as a breakaway province. Trump sought to stem the backlash resulting from the call by noting on Twitter it was the Taiwanese president who had called him. But he was rebuked for the call by foreign policy experts, who raised concerns about his propensity to behave unpredictably. Christopher Hill, former assistant secretary of state for east Asia and Pacific affairs under George W Bush, said Trump had broken a 40-year tradition in one clear policy related to China. \u201cObviously, it was an example of what is all too often happening now with this incoming administration, this tendency to wing it,\u201d Hill told CNN on Friday evening.  He added his concern that Trump\u2019s team would double down on the decision, as opposed to acknowledging the misstep. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge mistake,\u201d Hill said. \u201cAnd this is not going to be the last of these kind of things. So, things need to get \u2026 cleaned up in a hurry in Washington.\u201d The Connecticut senator Chris Murphy, another Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, criticized Trump in a series of tweets late on Friday. \u201cForeign policy consistency is a means, not an end. It\u2019s not sacred. Thus, it\u2019s Trump\u2019s right to shift policy, alliances, strategy,\u201d Murphy wrote.       America\u2019s allies, Murphy said, would \u201chave no clue\u201d what the country stood for if the conversation did not represent a genuine change in foreign policy but simply a temporary deviation at Trump\u2019s behest. The senator further underscored the need for Trump to nominate a secretary of state, \u201cpreferably [with] experience\u201d. In his defense, Trump tweeted: \u201cInteresting how the US sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.\u201d His transition team described the conversation in a statement as a discussion \u201cof the close economic, political and security ties that exist between Taiwan and the United States\u201d, in which the president-elect also congratulated Tsai on her election earlier this year.   Related: China lodges complaint with US over Trump's Taiwan phone call    The Taiwanese president characterized the phone call as an \u201cintimate and relaxed conversation\u201d that lasted 10 minutes.

Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump aide, pushed back on the notion that Trump did not grasp the implications of taking the phone call. \u201cHe either will disclose or not disclose the full contents of that conversation but he\u2019s well aware of what US policy has been,\u201d she told CNN."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/03/drones-us-uk-deal-predator-reaper-protector", "publicationDate": "2016-12-03T20:41:26Z", "tags": ["Drones (military)", "UK news", "US news", "Royal Air Force", "Military", "World news"], "sentences": ["Related: Critics say Trump's call with Taiwan may alter decades of foreign policy    With much uncertainty in Washington and abroad over Trump\u2019s approach to Iran and the multilateral deal sealed by Barack Obama to block Iran\u2019s path to a nuclear weapon, Fallon said the UK would seek to reassure Iran\u2019s neighbors that the provisions of the deal were enforced."], "title": "UK to double armed drone fleet in deal with US Predator manufacturer", "article": "Defense secretary Michael Fallon on Saturday announced a $125m (\u00a3100m) development deal with US arms manufacturer General Atomics under which the UK fleet of armed drones will double.

We may now indeed have a radical break in the US approach to the region. The first of these, with Nawaz Sharif from Pakistan, came with a detailed text of the conversation released by the Pakistani prime minister\u2019s office. He is reported to have lavished praise on Sharif and the country more generally in what appears to be Trump\u2019s typically solicitous approach to relationship building.  While not making any specific commitments or promises the detail of the call revealed by the Pakistan government makes life difficult for the US given how much time and effort it has put into improving its relations with India and may prompt unrealistic expectations in Islamabad. Then in a call with the Philippines\u2019 president, Rodrigo Duterte, the president-elect is reported to have endorsed Duterte\u2019s anti-drug campaign that has unleashed lawless vigilantism in which more than 5,000 people have died.  This was the source of the breakdown in US-Philippines relations, with Duterte famously calling Obama a \u201cson of a whore\u201d for criticising his approach. While Trump\u2019s endorsementmay mend fences with the Philippines, it flies in the face of America\u2019s decades-long commitment to human rights and the rule of law. Then to cap it off Trump took a highly publicised phone call from the relatively new Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen. Since the US recognised the People\u2019s Republic of China and ended diplomatic ties to Taiwan in 1979, no US president or president-elect has met or spoken to a Taiwanese president. In so doing Trump has inflamed cross-Strait relations \u2013 Beijing is blaming Taiwan for instigating the call \u2013 and cast doubts over the direction of US-China policy. Indeed some believe that this could presage the end of the \u201cone-China policy\u201d and herald a new cold war.           China dismisses Trump call with Taiwan as \u2018small trick\u2019    There is much uncertainty about just what these conversations entailed, who prompted them \u2013 Trump tweeted that the call came from Taiwan but it could only have occurred with his team\u2019s cooperation \u2013 and what policy import they will actually have.  There is a risk in overstating their importance, it is early days and these were short calls. But there does appear to be a thread to these conversations, particularly with Taiwan, that under Trump the US will adopt a hard-nosed realpolitik posture in Asia and that he is content to break with Washington orthodoxy even as it comes with real risks. But the calls also display an inexperienced foreign policy team that is handling itself clumsily and causing problems that will give the new administration headaches. In the case of China, depending on how Beijing chooses to respond, that headache could be severe. Equally, the calls are ceding a lot, in narrative terms, to the foreign leaders using calls to frame relations with the US in advantageous ways. That the US is allowing itself to be used in this way in striking. Transition between administrations is always a difficult time in US foreign policy. Based on the signals being sent this week, the Trump administration has ambition but also has much to learn about the complexities of managing the foreign dealings of the world\u2019s most powerful country. It will be an interesting four years. Nick Bisley is executive director of La Trobe Asia and professor of international relations at La Trobe University, Australia.

Returning host Stone used her monologue to revel in her familiarity with the show, which she likened to returning to her high school in a charming if unmemorable opening segment. It bled easily into a high school theatrical performance, where the black-clad actors determined that, \u201cnow more than ever\u201d, they must do their part to improve the world with heavy-handed scenes about fascism and gay rights. A smart, honest commentary on mindless liberalism, the sketch worked entirely due to Thompson and Vanessa Bayer as audience parents who could see through the bullshit.

It\u2019s hard to see where either was particularly objectionable. Jost seemed genuinely passionate while defending the protesters at Standing Rock, while Che made some smart points about the detrimental effects of the new smoking ban in public housing, an issue that clearly resonated with him. Finishing off with a self-serving but still amusing Jennifer Aniston cameo, the segment overall had a strong perspective and enough good jokes to make it worthwhile. The final sketch of the night was a smart take on the virgin birth, told from the perspective of Mary (Stone), who had some legitimate complaints about her lot in life. It worked solely because Stone sold it so well \u2013 the show is lucky to have such vibrant guests hosts who are willing to commit so strongly.

Children play on a concrete barrier freshened up by graffiti of a butterfly with pink wings, once a piece of the Berlin Wall. On Saturday, the library hosted a more bizarre monument to newer conservative politics: the Reagan National Defense Forum, a conference that provided subtle eulogies for the failed movement to stop Donald Trump.    Related: 'Putting lipstick on a pig': experts on why Obama is lending Trump a hand    Once, the national-security wing of the Republican party formed the core of the #NeverTrump coalition, issuing open letters that denounced the businessman\u2019s geopolitical recklessness or ignorance. Now Trump will be president, and that wing is coming to terms with it. At the Reagan library, it appeared most comfortable reframing Trump within familiar Republican approaches to foreign affairs, no matter how much rhetorical finesse the task required. Buck McKeon, a former California congressman, had finesse to spare. Outside a private conference room, he agreed to an on-camera interview about Trump and set to work disputing the premises of each question. Hasn\u2019t Trump shown himself to be hostile to free trade, a central aspect of the Reagan catechism?  \u201cI don\u2019t think you pull away from trade,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think he\u2019s setting an open stance for negotiation.

To many in Washington and around the world, it reaffirmed fears that Trump will blunder his way into international crisis. No one at the Reagan library defended the Trump-Tsai Ing-wen call outright.  But some prominent attendees were content to brush it aside. The South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who barely conceals his loathing for a man he on Saturday often called simply \u201cTrump\u201d, insisted the US had not backed away from the longstanding one-China policy, which does not challenge Beijing\u2019s insistence that Taiwan is a breakaway province. Dan Sullivan, a Republican senator from Alaska, said the Chinese reaction seemed muted, and suggested Congress had a well of support for Taiwan.  Such was the tenor of the conference: reinterpreting Trump to position him within the traditional modes of US foreign policy and Republican politics. His inconsistencies have given attendees enough to work with. Whereas on the campaign trail Trump called Nato \u201cobsolete\u201d and suggested conditioning the defense of allies on their ability to pay for it, now even Barack Obama says Trump doesn\u2019t actually mean it.  Yet some of Trump\u2019s departures can\u2019t be spun away. Russia, the b\u00eate noire of this year\u2019s conference, is chief among them. Dick Cheney, the former vice-president, called Vladimir Putin, to whom Trump has been warm, \u201ca very dangerous man\u201d. Without attempting to reconcile his perspective and Trump\u2019s \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not here today to advise Mr Trump,\u201d he said \u2013 Cheney urged Trump to \u201creassert US leadership in the world\u201d.

Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    Senior military officers, whose relationship to Trump is fixed by the constitution, also endeavored to fit Trump into their standard ways of doing business.  Asked about Trump\u2019s fixation on the military virtues of unpredictability, the chief of staff of the air force, Gen David Goldfein, said that as long as he provides Trump with a menu of tactical options, \u201cif there\u2019s an unpredictability in that, I\u2019ve done my job\u201d. The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, the marine general Joseph Dunford, met Trump\u2019s transition team on Wednesday and said to expect \u201csome course corrections\u201d on military strategy against the Islamic State \u2013 though Dunford did not address specific Trump suggestions, such as killing the families of Isis fighters or stealing oil from Iraq. Without ever criticising their incoming commander-in-chief, the officers tiptoed around the departure from traditional foreign policy that Trump represents. Asked what he wanted more than anything else to address global threats, Dunford said \u201ca consensus on national security\u201d. Gen Mark Milley, the chief of staff of the army, echoed Dunford on a need to re-establish first principles. \u201cWe need to be clear. What is America\u2019s role in the world?\u201d Milley said.  If Trump\u2019s conversation with the Taiwanese president caused the Reagan forum attendees to cringe, his selection of Dunford\u2019s fellow marine Jim Mattis as defense secretary caused them to exhale. Enthusiasm for Mattis echoed from every panelist who spoke his name. Speaking for many, Cheney praised the Mattis appointment as a critical step to blunting Trump\u2019s excesses. It fell to some of the foreigners at the conference to raise an alarm about Trump, however diplomatically.  Norway\u2019s minister of defense, Ine Eriksen Soreide, presented her country as nervous and vulnerable to a resurgent Russia and warned: \u201cYou can really not take European security for granted.\u201d She implored the American public to see Nato as a collection of 27 stalwart friends, rather than a burden, and said the alliance needed clarity on how Trump views Russia.  \u201cIt is paramount that the new administration comes out with a clear, consistent, firm, predictable stance on Russia early,\u201d she said.    Related: James Mattis called for reduction of US stockpile of land-based nuclear missiles    Similarly, Ng Eng Hen, Singapore\u2019s minister of defense, warned against adopting a hostile posture against China, which is deepening its economic ties with south-east Asia at a time when the region sees the US as abandoning the field. Containing China is \u201cneither necessary or desirable\u201d, he said, while making security the prime feature of the US approach to Asia would leave Washington with a \u201cbrittle\u201d policy.  \u2018You trade with your friends\u2019 Of all the prominent US politicians at the conference, Graham seemed to have the hardest time coming to terms with Trump.  A traditional Republican defense and trade hawk, his exasperation was often on display. Beyond the Taiwan call, China was \u201clicking [its] chops\u201d at the US abandonment of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, he said. US standing in Asia was the \u201cbig loser of 2016\u201d. He vowed to do \u201call I can to get the Republican party back to where it was: you trade with your friends\u201d. Graham also raised his voice in objection to the notion Trump advanced that the US\u2019s Asian allies were taking advantage of its defense umbrella: \u201cSouth Korea and Japan have paid a lot.\u201d Then he reeled himself in. Trump will have a \u201clot of problems\u201d, he said. \u201cWe all have to help him.\u201d  \u201cIf you\u2019re unsure what\u2019s going to happen, so am I,\u201d Graham continued, addressing US allies. \u201cBut we\u2019ll be friends through the process.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/04/vladimir-putin-russia-donald-trump-smart-man", "publicationDate": "2016-12-04T15:57:36Z", "tags": ["Vladimir Putin", "Donald Trump", "Russia", "US politics", "US news", "World news"], "sentences": ["Related: Trump's Taiwan call exposes his inexperience, China state media say    Officials in the Obama administration accused Russia of hacking Democratic party servers as a ploy to interfere with the election, which Putin denied."], "title": "Putin says Trump's business record shows he is a 'smart man'", "article": "Russian president Vladimir Putin has said Donald Trump\u2019s business success is evidence the US president-elect is a \u201csmart man\u201d.

In the interview broadcast on Sunday, Putin said western leaders should listen more closely to views from governments in Russia and the Middle East.  \u201cThey listen to those whose voices are loud enough to be heard,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s some insignificant issue in international relations, then, of course, you can save face.

Barack Obama has called for Assad to step down, but US efforts to negotiate with Russia and Syria \u2013 while fighting jihadi groups and supporting rebels \u2013 have repeatedly failed. \u201cOf course I am counting on joining forces with the United States in the fight with the real, not invented, threat of international terrorism,\u201d Putin said.

Russian officials have long accused counterparts in the Obama administration of meddling abroad, for instance in 2011, when Putin claimed that Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, was fomenting dissent against him within Russia.

Military contingency plans are doubtless being dusted off in Beijing.  Reaction in Taiwan to Trump\u2019s rushing in where diplomatic angels fear to tread has been both febrile and fearful. Supporters of independence, including some within Tsai\u2019s ruling party, are talking about a \u201cnew model\u201d of closer relations with the US, extending beyond trade and defence to cooperation on the international stage. Reports are circulating in Taipei that Tsai may meet Trump in person next month during a stopover in New York, en route to Nicaragua, one of Taiwan\u2019s few allies. Such a meeting would be sensational \u2013 and is likely to provoke an open rift with Beijing. Tsai\u2019s spokespeople described the reports as \u201cwild speculation\u201d but did not specifically deny them.  Meanwhile, opposition MPs from the Beijing-friendly Chinese Nationalist party (KMT) and political commentators warned that Trump\u2019s meddling could create a cross-straits crisis of the kind last seen in the 1990s, when Bill Clinton sent warships to defend Taiwan amid a menacing Chinese missile buildup.  Xi is already ill-disposed to the Tsai government and has suspended talks and other exchanges. Tsai\u2019s domestic critics say Taiwan could pay a high price for Trump\u2019s blundering.

The answer to the question is not as easy as it might seem.    Taiwanjoins others that suffer from incomplete recognition, such as South Ossetia and Somaliland    Taiwan\u2019s peculiar existence dates back to the Chinese civil war, which ran for decades during the 20th century between communists and nationalists. When the communists prevailed and Mao\u2019s People\u2019s Republic of China was established on the mainland, the previous government of the Republic of China was self-exiled on the island of Taiwan, continuing to claim sovereignty over the whole of China. The cold war world was slow-moving, but eventually recognition shifted from the exiled government to the People\u2019s Republic of China. Swiftly, formal ties with the island were cut and communist China replaced the exiled government in the UN and elsewhere. That was in the late 1970s, the era during which official relations between Taiwan and the US were frozen \u2013 until Trump. In recent times, the dispute between China and Taiwan has been about who is sovereign over Taiwan, rather than the whole of China. Beijing sees Taiwan as a Chinese province, while Taiwan claims independence as an island state. Because China is recognised as sovereign, the vast majority of states do not recognise Taiwan, and the island joins others that suffer from incomplete recognition, such as breakaway regions of the post-Soviet space (for example South Ossetia or Abkhazia in Georgia), Somaliland and Western Sahara in Africa, or Kosovo and Palestine, which, although much more recognised, are still short of full membership to the club of states. Unlike most other unrecognised states, however, Taiwan is in practice a part of the world, with a stable political system and a booming economy. It has good trade links \u2013 astonishingly, it is the 10th largest trade partner of the US \u2013 works with bodies such as the World Trade Organisation, and takes part in events such as the Olympic Games and the World Cup.   Related: Donald Trump serves up clumsiness, inexperience and realpolitik in Asia | Nick Bisley    Of the other unrecognised states, only Kosovo and Palestine compete in similar events \u2013 in fact, Kosovo\u2019s first ever participation in Rio 2016 was celebrated as a sign of its state credentials being recognised. But the fact that Taiwan is so well-integrated might partially explain why so many were surprised at the impropriety of a call between the US and Taiwanese presidents, and why one of the most popular Google searches following Trump\u2019s call was \u201cis Taiwan a country?\u201d. The answer is not as straightforward as it may seem. With a permanent population and territory and a government that can control them, Taiwan certainly looks like a state. The fact that Taiwan joins other states in international events and bodies, makes it look even more so. However, it is easy to come to the opposite conclusion, since only a small number of other states recognise the government there, despite their commercial and sporting links with the island. Indeed, one way in which Taiwan has managed to be part of the world despite the lack of formal recognition is by being flexible with its diplomacy. For example, it often avoids using its \u201cstate\u201d name and instead opts for Chinese Taipei, which is not as controversial for China. But the dilemma remains: what matters more \u2013 behaving like a state or being seen as one? Certainly, in the wake of Trump\u2019s call, it looks as if it\u2019s the latter. This is probably why it has angered China, which seems to be more fussed about the symbolism behind the call rather than the actual links between the two sides, which have remained strong for a number of years, and never seemed likely to be diminished.

As long as Taiwan refrains from declaring independence (and it is unlikely it will use this as an opportunity to do so), China won\u2019t make an aggressive move. In fact, relations between Taiwan and China have progressed a lot over the past few years, despite the fact they still do not recognise each other.

On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to slap tariffs on Chinese imports as a way to save American manufacturing jobs. His rhetoric suggests he\u2019s chomping at the bit for a trade war. But Trump will need China\u2019s help. His own slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d, implicitly acknowledges the declining power of the United States, and it is true that when it comes to North Korea, the US is not powerful enough at this moment and on its own to deal with its most pressing national security problem.

I don&#39;t think so!&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016    It is a fact that we have a nuclear North Korea. In their meeting two days after the election, Barack Obama warned Trump about Pyongyang. It made an impression on Trump, who obliquely referenced it in his later interview with the New York Times. Kim Jong-un may take advantage of the early months of Trump\u2019s presidency to test the new leader \u2013 something his father, Kim Jong-il, did by detonating a second nuclear device shortly after Obama\u2019s first term as president. The danger has accelerated over the past eight years, and North Korea now has the ability to mount a weapon on a ballistic missile. One of the few things the US can do is to appeal to China to bring pressure to bear on North Korea over its programme. It has not been a particularly effective strategy, but unfortunately it is one of just a few diplomatic options the US has left. Since he won the election, Trump has continued to take to Twitter. Critics call it an irresponsible compulsion, supporters believe it\u2019s part of a grand strategy. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, has accused the media of taking everything Trump says literally. \u201cThe American people didn\u2019t. They understood it,\u201d he added.     Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen, speaks on the phone to Donald Trump. Photograph: Reuters    Perhaps those Americans who voted for Trump do not expect him to actually wage a trade war with China. Perhaps China will choose not to take what Trump tweets as planned policy. But both suppositions are dangerous to take for granted. In China, Trump\u2019s words have already riled one of the major state-controlled papers reflecting Communist party views. The Global Times writes that China must fight back, \u201cregardless of the consequences to the dynamics of the Sino-US relationship\u201d. Trump will need that relationship \u2013 including that trade relationship \u2013 if he wants to maintain stability on the Korean peninsula. On the trade front, any real trade war would harm both economies, and Trump waging one would cut off America\u2019s nose to spite its face. Almost one-fifth of China\u2019s exports head to the US, and China has unique leverage from its control of supply chains for some of the US\u2019s most important products, such as iPhones. Tariffs would not build new factories in the US; they would only mean that factories in China producing for the US would move to Vietnam or another southeast Asian country \u2013 a trend that is already happening. This latest round of geopolitical handwringing began with a call between Trump and Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen. Trump\u2019s team may insist that words signify nothing, but if that was truly the belief, Trump himself would not have responded so quickly on Twitter to say that Tsai had initiated the call.   Related: Beijing grits teeth in face of Trump's tweets    The exchange upended a diplomatic arrangement established almost 40 years ago that switched US recognition of China from Taipei to Beijing. Policymakers on both sides of the political aisle panicked. Media headlines sounded the siren. But in the past day or so, some of that has given way to calmer commentary \u2013 not just from Republicans \u2013 acknowledging that a recalibration of the US-Taiwan relationship, and as a consequence the US-China relationship, is overdue. On Monday during the White House\u2019s regular press briefing, spokesman Josh Earnest said: \u201cProgress that we have made in our relationship with China could be undermined\u201d by Trump\u2019s call. The view of critics of the Obama administration, however, is precisely that there has not been enough progress to justify maintaining the status quo with Beijing. Trump\u2019s main advisers on China want to get tough. But past presidents have also had ambitious plans concerning China, only to soften their position once in office. Staunch anti-communist Ronald Reagan opposed normalising relations with Beijing and spoke frequently in support of Taiwan while on the campaign trail. By 1984, as president, he had made his first trip to a communist country \u2013 to the People\u2019s Republic of China. If history is at all helpful, it suggests that Trump\u2019s Twitter tune on China may yet change."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/06/donald-trump-secretary-of-state-jon-huntsman-stavridis", "publicationDate": "2016-12-06T14:17:40Z", "tags": ["Trump administration", "Donald Trump", "US politics", "US news", "US foreign policy", "Jon Huntsman"], "sentences": ["He defended Trump\u2019s controversial decision to hold a phone conversation with the Taiwan president, Tsai Ing-wen, which broke a 37-year diplomatic norm and upset Beijing."], "title": "Donald Trump's secretary of state search expands to include new raft of hopefuls", "article": "Donald Trump\u2019s very public auditions for the job of next US secretary of state look set for an extended run, as surprise new hopefuls were added the invitation list to ride the golden elevator to the top of Trump Tower.  Among the new names floated in press leaks on Monday were Jon Huntsman, former Utah governor and ambassador to China, Rex Tillerson, the chief executive officer of the Exxon Mobil oil company and Nato\u2019s former commander in Europe, and the retired admiral James Stavridis.  The expanded search will come as a disappointment to the four men who were on the shortlist last week: the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, the former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, the retired general David Petraeus and the Republican senator Bob Corker. They seemed headed for a final until the weekend, when Trump, a former reality TV star and a master of suspense, unveiled a new season with a fresh cast of characters.  Not all the new names are necessarily in line for the secretary of state job. Juli Hanscom, a spokeswoman for the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, where Stavridis is the dean, confirmed that he would be going to New York to talk to the president-elect on Thursday but added: \u201cThere has been no discussion of a position in the Trump administration.\u201d     Retired admiral James Stavridis in 2010. Photograph: Oleg Popov/Reuters     Stavridis, a registered independent, was vetted by the Hillary Clinton campaign in July as a possible running mate.

Huntsman urged Trump to drop out of the race and let his running mate compete for the presidency instead.   \u201cI\u2019m around to serve my country. I\u2019ve always believed in that, and any way I can help I can always stand up, salute and do what I can,\u201d Huntsman told NBC News on Monday. He defended Trump\u2019s controversial decision to hold a phone conversation with the Taiwan president, Tsai Ing-wen, which broke a 37-year diplomatic norm and upset Beijing.   \u201cIt provides space and leverage in the overall US-China relationship. It\u2019s been tried and talked before, but what is different this time is you\u2019ve got a businessman who has become president of the United States, who understands real leverage and how to find real leverage in that relationship,\u201d he said.  Huntsman, who speaks Mandarin Chinese, was appointed ambassador to China by Barack Obama in 2009 and served there until 2011 when he resigned and returned to the US to stage a presidential campaign.   Forbes magazine noted that if Huntsman were nominated as secretary of state, he would be the third scion of a billionaire family to be picked for Trump\u2019s cabinet. The 56-year-old Utah politician\u2019s father founded Huntsman Corp, a Texas-based chemical company. Like Romney, Huntsman comes from an established and wealthy Mormon family.  Tillerson, the Exxon executive, is due to meet Trump on Tuesday. He is a prominent conservative businessman who has generally funded Republican campaigns, but did not contribute to the Trump presidential bid.   Also mentioned in press leaks as being under consideration for the secretary of state job are the Californian Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher, an outspoken supporter of Vladimir Putin (who recalled over the weekend a drunken arm-wrestling match in the early 1990s with the future Russian leader) and a Democratic senator from West Virginia, Joe Manchin, who backed Clinton in the campaign. Manchin met the president-elect last week, and was touted earlier as a possible energy secretary. Also on the newly extended list is John Bolton, an ultra-conservative former ambassador to the UN, who was thought to have dropped out of contention, but who visited Trump in New York on Friday and is said to be still under consideration.     John Bolton, former US ambassador to the United Nations, waves as he leaves Trump Tower on Friday.

Related: First Republican 'faithless elector' announces intent to vote against Trump    \u201cThe time it has taken is not unusual. The fact he is talking to several candidates is not unusual. The fact he is turning it into a parade is quite different,\u201d said Stephen Walt, professor of international affairs at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. \u201cOne of the reasons people normally do it quietly is that you can avoid humiliating and embarrassing the people who don\u2019t get the job or are asked to serve in a more junior capacity.\u201d  The public way Trump has gone about it and the risk of wounded pride, Walt said, \u201cis quite short-sighted, because the last thing you want is other Republicans or VIPs out there bad-mouthing you from the outside\u201d. \u201cTrump more than anything else views the transition as public relations. It is dominating the news cycles,\u201d Walt said. \u201cHe has turned it into an audience-participation spectacle, which creates enormous suspense.\u201d  Part of that spectacle so far has been a line of public figures who had failed to support or even derided the president-elect during the campaign, entering Trump Tower in recent days and then emerging, singing his praises.

There is much speculation around just what President-elect Trump intended to signal in his telephone call last week with Tsai Ing-wen, the president of (or on, depending on your viewpoint) Taiwan. Was it the first of many political blunders? Did Trump simply stumble over Beijing\u2019s One China policy?

Coverage of European politics features prominently in this edition, too. In Italy, voters in a referendum rejected constitutional reforms proposed by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, sparking Renzi\u2019s resignation and leaving politics there in flux. In France, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said he would not seek re-election next year. In Austria, meanwhile, the electorate rejected a far-right candidate in a presidential election rerun in favour of a left-leaning, pro-Europe moderate, leaving many in the EU breathing a very deep sigh of relief. In Africa, Gambians celebrated as the country\u2019s autocratic president, Yahya Jammeh, conceded power. And on the other side of the world, New Zealand\u2019s popular prime minister, John Key, surprised the country by announcing he was stepping down. It can be difficult to keep up: we\u2019re here to help. There was some upbeat news on the environmental front: China stepped back from building a series of dams on the Nujiang river, the Sioux tribe won a major victory in its standoff with big oil along the banks of the Missouri river, and four of the world\u2019s largest cities agreed to ban diesel cars by 2025.

China\u2019s calls came as it emerged that former Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole may have played a role in setting up the controversial 10-minute conversation between Trump and Tsai that has so angered Beijing.  The New York Times reported that in the lead-up to that call Dole, now a Washington lobbyist, had spent six months working behind the scenes to establish high-level contact between Taiwanese officials and Trump staff.  \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that we may have had some influence,\u201d Dole was quoted as saying by the Wall Street Journal.

The notion of the US acting as the world\u2019s police has got out of hand. With troops stationed in countries across the world, and military spending totalling more than the next 16\u00a0countries\u2019 combined, the overreach of the US military is staggering, and yielding terrible results. It doesn\u2019t take much research beyond the mainstream media to realise the intervention in Libya was a disaster, bringing massive destabilisation to the region and creating a power vacuum for terrorist groups like Isis. The Iraq war was predicated on bad intelligence and the false claim that there were weapons of mass destruction under Saddam Hussein. The\u00a0sheer recklessness of such interventionist policies has resulted in massive loss of life and destabilisation. In 2008, Americans were sold by anti-war promises of Barack Obama. Instead, they merely saw the continuation of establishment interventionist policies of past administrations. Grassroots support for a non-interventionist policy and the end to irresponsible and misguided regime change in other countries was evident in the Tea Party movement and Congressman Ron Paul\u2019s presidential runs. Finally, in Donald Trump, these voices have been recognised and voted into the White House. Detractors will be quick to call Mr Trump\u2019s policies reckless and primitive. But non-interventionism is not isolationism and, despite the mainstream media pushing a narrative that suggests otherwise, Mr Trump\u2019s positions on foreign policy have been clear and consistent far before his foray into politics.

Related: Trump 'tantrums' signal trouble for China-US relations \u2013 state media    Questions have been raised over whether 70-year-old Branstad\u2019s CV is relevant to such a crucial posting.

I liked a line in the Reuters report that said, \u2018His many years running Iowa, the top US state for production of corn, soybeans and pigs, may not have prepared him for the more delicate tasks of diplomacy with Beijing.\u2019\u201d Branstad has known Xi since 1985, when Xi visited Iowa as a young regional government official leading an agricultural research delegation. Branstad was governor at the time, and the pair remained in contact. In 2011, Branstad visited Beijing and met with Xi at the Great Hall of the People; a year later, when he was vice-president, Xi stopped in Muscatine, Iowa, where he met his host family from the 1985 trip. Branstad, a champion of exporting Iowa\u2019s agricultural products to China who has visited the country four times in the past seven years, said: \u201cDuring our 30-year friendship, President Xi Jinping and I have developed a respect and admiration for each other, our people and our cultures.

The 10-minute conversation with Tsai, which followed efforts by the lobbyist and former senator Bob Dole on behalf of Taiwan, upended relations and forced the White House to provide reassurance. Then, on Monday, Trump wrote on Twitter: \u201cDid China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the U.S. doesn\u2019t tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?

He is intentionally blowing up global stability for the sake of an extremist agenda concocted by hawkish aides who make Dick Cheney look like Kofi Annan. That\u2019s why the strange case of the Taiwan telephone call is worth examining because it is surely a sign of things to come. At first, Team Trump dismissed the call with the Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen as an innocent congratulatory message. Mike Pence, the vice-president elect, suggested it was no big deal, telling ABC it was \u201cnothing more than taking a courtesy call\u201d.  These excuses seemed weak after foreign policy experts predicted the Taiwan call would lead to a major breach with US policy, which has been in place since 1979. Then, they fell apart after the New York Times reported that the call was the result of a long-planned and well-funded lobbying effort by the Taiwanese themselves. According to the New York Times, it was all orchestrated by its paid foreign agent, Bob Dole, the former Republican presidential nominee and Senate leader. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that we had some influence,\u201d Dole said. \u201cWhen you represent a client, and they make requests, you\u2019re supposed to respond.\u201d That influence included special attention at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July, attended by a Taiwanese delegation, where the party platform was changed for the first time to include several commitments to Taiwan\u2019s security. Another president-elect might consider such money-making from national security dangerous, disloyal or worse. But Taiwan newspapers have reported that the Trump Organization itself is interested in a possible hotel project close to Taiwan\u2019s international airport. According to the report, a sales manager visited Taiwan as recently as October, although a spokeswoman for the business said there were \u201cno plans for expansion into Taiwan.\u201d Perhaps the Taiwan phone call is as innocent as Trump\u2019s meeting with his Indian business partners just days before his business signed a new deal in Kolkata. Perhaps his phone call with the Argentine president has nothing to do with the re-starting of a long-stalled Buenos Aires tower.

First there is a stunned reaction from foreign policy experts and the media at the brazen disregard for protocol and national interest. Then there is an attempt to explain away the dramatic shift as an inexperienced gaffe. Finally there is a realization that we have all been gamed by a manipulative and secret coterie that is in fact Trump\u2019s inner circle. So it was that Trump himself explained the Taiwan call initially as him casually picking up the phone. \u201cThe President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency,\u201d he tweeted last week. \u201cThank you!\u201d It wasn\u2019t clear who he was thanking in that tweet, but it was clear soon afterwards that the story was falling apart.

I don\u2019t think so!\u201d We could argue all day about international taxes, and how the US actually imposes tariffs on Chinese goods. But what\u2019s the point of talking about the facts with a man like Donald Trump? What matters much more are his motives, and for now they go far beyond the notion that he\u2019s a simpleton. We may have returned to the satirical heyday of Will Ferrell\u2019s George W Bush, but the jokes don\u2019t tell the full story.

One minute they are \u201craping\u201d America, the next they are his best clients. Even the way he says the word \u2013 and he says it a lot \u2013 seeds confusion. Sometimes the president-elect spits it out like poison, sometimes he exclaims the word as if greeting a favoured child. Whatever his real attitude, those that study the world\u2019s second-largest economy believe US-China relations are in for a rocky time when Trump reaches the White House \u2013 and the global consequences could be dire. Trump excoriated China\u2019s trade policies during his election campaign and succeeded in needling Beijing into threats of retaliation after pledging to whack a 45% tariff on Chinese imports. The president-elect rattled Beijing again earlier this month after taking a call from Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen \u2013 the first communication between top officials from the two governments in nearly 40 years. Last week he seemed to be attempting to mend fences, appointing Iowa governor Terry Branstad, \u201can old friend of the Chinese people\u201d according to Beijing officials, as his ambassador to China. But such a signal has not been enough to head off worries of a looming trade war between China and the US that would send shockwaves across the globe. \u201cThe initial signs are not good,\u201d said Minxin Pei, professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California and author of the book China\u2019s Crony Capitalism. The US has recognised Taiwan as part of China since 1979 and its status is \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d, said Pei. Branstad is an interesting pick and \u201cshows a gesture that he wants to keep the relationship on an even keel\u201d. But Pei said descriptions of Branstad as a longtime friend of Chinese leader Xi Jinpin were overblown. \u201cThat\u2019s a very American way of describing friendship. Very few Chinese leaders have longtime friends,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat China really values in an ambassador is not his relationship with them but his relationship with the White House.\u201d Those doing business with the two trading powers will have a lot invested in the pro-trade Branstad\u2019s powers of persuasion. Academic studies have already shown the consequences of political spats with Beijing. In 2010 the University of Gottingen in Germany coined the term \u201cthe Dalai Lama effect\u201d after its study found countries whose top leadership met with Tibet\u2019s exiled spiritual leader lost on average 8.1% in exports to China in the two years following the meeting. The first true test of the Trump White House\u2019s relationship with China may come in April, when the US Treasury releases a report looking at China\u2019s currency. Trump has long maintained that China has been devaluing its currency in order to stack the deck on exports in its favour. \u201cIf he wants to impose tariffs on China, he needs a procedural excuse. He can\u2019t just get into the White House and the next day announce a tariff increase, it wouldn\u2019t look good,\u201d said Pei.           China dismisses Trump call with Taiwan as \u2018small trick\u2019    Allegations of Chinese currency manipulation are out of date and largely incorrect, according to Pei. In fact, Beijing has been burning through its currency reserves in an attempt to prop up the value of the yuan. \u201cBut for Donald Trump that doesn\u2019t matter. Intellectual rigour is not one of his concerns.\u201d Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics and a former senior China economist at the World Bank, said it was \u201cmore legitimate now than at anytime in the last 10 years to talk about the risk of something pretty close to a trade war\u201d, he said. \u201cAnyone with a stake in Chinese exports, especially to the US, should be worried,\u201d said Kuijs, adding that US and European companies that assemble products in China would also see their bottom lines affected. If a trade war starts, it is likely to start with targeted hits, said Pei. If Trump wants to placate his base in the midwest he could target Chinese steel, for example. China is engaging \u201cin at least questionable\u201d practices in the steel industry, says Pei. \u201cThe industry has so much overcapacity and they are exporting a lot of cheap steel and that is disrupting.\u201d If the moves are small enough, China might chose to ignore them and concentrate on the bigger picture. But past at a certain point, Beijing will retaliate and would likely target large American firms, Boeing or Apple for example, that increasingly rely on China. Both sides have a lot to lose in a trade war. China is currently the US\u2019s largest goods trading partner. Trade between the two was worth $598bn in total during 2015, with US exports to China totalling $116bn and imports totalling $482bn. China has more to lose but the types of goods it sells to the US are harder to source elsewhere. The three largest categories of goods China buys from the US are soybeans, cars and aircraft, all of which China could source from elsewhere. The three largest categories that the US imports from China are mobile phones, tablets/laptops and network equipment. \u201cIn each case, China is the dominant global supplier, producing about 70% of global output. A high tariff would end up as effectively a tax on US purchases of consumer electronics,\u201d Capital Economics\u2019 chief Asia economist wrote in a recent note to investors. Tariffs on those goods would also disrupt trade right across the Asia Pacific region, said Pei. Some 35% of China\u2019s exports in 2015 was \u201cprocessing trade\u201d, where China imports components from other countries and assembles them for exports. A trade war with China on those goods would cause collateral damage on imports from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and others. While both sides would suffer, China\u2019s economy is more reliant on US exports and a serious spat would rock the economy at a time of sluggish growth. Household debt has soared as property prices have increased, and millions of workers are set to lose their jobs as the government seeks to rebalance the economy away from state-led investments. Not all factory owners in China are worried about an upcoming trade war. \u201cTrump\u2019s grandstanding performances during the campaign were for publicity, but he\u2019s a successful businessman and therefore should be very rational in his thinking,\u201d said Sun Sijun, chief executive of Uptop Group in southern China, which exports between $150m-$200m worth of Samsonite suitcases and Walmart shoes to the US every year. \u201cRationally, the basic interests are not to make enemies, and to ultimately not harm yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump\u2019s talk of increasing tariffs is in the hope of increasing employment in America,\u201d Sun said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a very small probability you can bring these labour-intensive industries back to the US. Labour-intensive industries flowed to third world, and they won\u2019t return to America.\u201d But other producers in China see only dark clouds on the horizon. Chen Yadong also sells to Walmart. His company, Indena, makes computer mice and bluetooth speakers, sending more than 1m mice to the US each year.  \u201cI\u2019m extremely worried,\u201d Chen said from the electronics manufacturing hub of Shenzhen in southern China. \u201cThe US is the largest market for export-oriented companies here. If Trump increases tariffs, then this business will become increasingly difficult.\u201d China\u2019s leaders don\u2019t know what to think of Trump quite yet, said Pei. But they do understand the consequences of a trade war. \u201cThe Chinese have a proverb: \u2018you lift a rock only to drop it on your own foot.\u2019\u201d Additional reporting by Christy Yao"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/11/trump-us-economy-boom-inflation-china", "publicationDate": "2016-12-11T07:00:21Z", "tags": ["US economy", "Federal Reserve", "Chinese economy", "Inflation", "Donald Trump", "Royal Bank of Scotland", "Financial Conduct Authority", "Sports Direct International"], "sentences": ["He has so far backed away from a confrontation with Beijing, except for his acceptance of a call from the Taiwanese premier."], "title": "Donald Trump has a handy scapegoat when economic clouds appear", "article": "US president-elect Donald Trump is known for boasting: \u201cThe beauty of me is that I am very rich.\u201d It\u2019s a comment that he hoped underline his independence from corporate lobbying and his prowess at making money. Since his victory, most of America appears to be believe his property industry wheeler-dealing will turn an already fast-moving economy \u2013 it was zipping along at a 3.2% annualised rate in the third quarter of 2016 \u2013 into the stellar performer it was in the 1990s. As an appetiser to this feast of growth, the US is about to get a rise in interest rates courtesy of the Federal Reserve, from the current 0.25%-0.5% target range to 0.5%-0.75%. For the savers who form the backbone of the Trump electorate, it could be the first of many if the economic growth rate accelerates in 2017. Fed chief Janet Yellen, who was once in Trump\u2019s sights as a Washington swamp dweller, will probably be declared a hero of the thrifty common man and woman when she makes the announcement on Wednesday. Yellen will talk of the strengthening manufacturing sector and the gathering momentum in the housebuilding industry. Retail sales are also buoyant, which is no surprise after surveys showed consumer confidence spiking in November. To illustrate the faith consumers have in a Trump presidency, the Conference Board consumer confidence index shook off a dip in October to regain pre-recession levels. And the CNBC All-America Economic Survey found that the percentage of Americans who believe the economy will get better in the next year climbed by an unprecedented 17 points to 42% \u2013 the highest it has been since Barack Obama was first elected in 2008. During the election campaign, Yellen was circumspect about further interest rate rises, fearing that any green shoots would wither and die. This reticence dates back to the decision to raise interest rates last December \u2013 the first increase in almost a decade \u2013 when minutes of the Fed\u2019s meeting revealed it had been a \u201cclose call\u201d for some policymakers. The new year brought a plunge in oil and share prices, and signs that global trade was weakening. Analysts scratched further rises from their forecasts. Trump\u2019s win alters the character of the coming year. His nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin (pronounced Mi-new-chin) has already declared he wants to cut taxes as much for middle-income earners as for big business. The former Goldman Sachs deal-maker also wants to tear up business regulations to spur growth of 3% to 4%, year in, year out. If the consumer confidence figures are anything to go by, a burst of high-street spending will trigger a mini-boom, with the tax cuts kicking in later in the year to keep the momentum going into 2018. But what then? The prospect is that inflation will take off, the dollar will soar and a rush of imports will send the balance of payments further into deficit. Inflation will hurt consumers, while an even stronger dollar depresses exports. USA Inc is already squealing about the dollar. To say they will be furiously lobbying the White House if it heads any higher must be an understatement. Trump will want a scapegoat. Rather than Yellen, it\u2019s likely to be the Chinese and any other trading partner deemed to be somehow ripping off US households. The Chinese, in Trump\u2019s map of global villains, get full access to US markets at artificially low prices following several years of currency manipulation. US companies also \u2013 the president-elect alleges \u2013 have their patented secrets stolen, and access to Chinese markets blocked. He has so far backed away from a confrontation with Beijing, except for his acceptance of a call from the Taiwanese premier. But a trade war with China is a card he could still play if his mini-boom gets out of hand.     Not a soft touch then: Financial Conduct Authority chief Andrew Bailey. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images    Not the time to go soft on RBS Andrew Bailey looks like everyone\u2019s favourite uncle. But if the events of recent days are anything to go by, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority represents proof that looks can be deceiving. In the space of a week, Bailey has cracked down on spread-betters, crowdfunders and peer-to-peer lenders as well as. He has also sent a warning shot to the banks that they could be on the hook for even more claims for mis-selling payment protection insurance. This is not what was expected of Bailey when he was cajoled out of the Bank of England this year into his new job by the then chancellor, George Osborne. Last summer Osborne chose not to renew Martin \u201cshoot first ask questions later\u201d Wheatley\u2019s contract as FCA head in what was regarded as a signal that the Conservative government intended to take a more conciliatory approach to the City. On the latest evidence, any comfort the City took from Bailey\u2019s appointment was misplaced. In the post-Brexit world, Europe\u2019s financial centre might have had reason to hope for an easier ride from its regulators as it battles to prevent financial business moving to the US or Europe. Bailey\u2019s swipe last month at fund managers \u2013 just one of many financial industries now at risk \u2013 and their \u201csustained, high profits\u201d showed that he is not yet ready to listen to special pleading. So, Bailey is off to a good start. But it too early to offer applause. There is plenty to do. One of the items near the top of his to-do-list is Royal Bank of Scotland. Bailey should ensure that the bailed-out bank is not let off the hook for any mistreatment of small business customers. He has warned MPs on the Treasury select committee that the crucial report into how small business were handled could be subject to Maxwellisation. This means individuals mentioned get a chance to respond to what is said about them prior to publication. Bailey should ensure this does not stop the RBS report being published in full. Will we ever see a normal Sports Direct? Mike Ashley really doesn\u2019t get it, does he? Last week Sports Direct unveiled a 57% slump in half-year profits, together with details of a new deal that could eventually hand big rewards to his 20-year-old daughter. Oh, and the company is about to take delivery of a new $50m corporate jet which will \u201cfacilitate efficiencies\u201d relating to management time. One of the main grievances shareholders have with Sports Direct is that Ashley runs it like a private company. There are other deviations from conventional listed-company behaviour. SD has not had a proper finance director for some three years. Ashley\u2019s number two, Karen Byers \u2013 who he says actually runs the firm \u2013 is not on the board either.

In a separate statement, the ministry cited Foreign Minister Wang Yi as warning during a trip to Switzerland against moves to damage the \u201cone China\u201d principle, having been asked by a reporter about Trump\u2019s call with Tsai.  \u201cChina is paying close attention to developments,\u201d Wang said. \u201cI can clearly say that no matter whether the Tsai Ing-wen authority, any other person in the world, or any other force, if they try and damage the one China principle and harm China\u2019s core interests, in the end they are lifting a rock only to drop it on their feet.\u201d  Trump\u2019s comments came less than a fortnight after he looked to have initiated a potentially damaging diplomatic row with Beijing by holding a telephone conversation with Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen, and subsequently attacking China on Twitter. In what was widely seen as an attempt to soothe tensions, Trump subsequently appointed the Iowa governor, Terry Branstad \u2013 a man China called \u201can old friend of the Chinese people\u201d \u2013 as ambassador to Beijing.  Orville Schell, the head of the Centre on US-China Relations at New York\u2019s Asia Society, said Trump\u2019s latest comments \u2013 which the academic described as an \u201cincredible provocation\u201d \u2013 were the latest example of the billionaire\u2019s contradictory moves towards China.  \u201cHe sometimes punches Beijing and he sometimes seems to reach out and hug them. The phone call to Tsai Ing-wen would be the former. Terry Branstad would be the latter. Now we have another uppercut,\u201d he said of the Fox News interview.  Speaking on Sunday, Trump defended his protocol-shredding decision to talk to President Tsai on 2 December, the first such conversation between a US president or president-elect and a leader of the self-ruled island since ties between America and Taiwan were severed in 1979.  China considers Taiwan a renegade province and does not allow countries to maintain diplomatic relations with both Taipei and Beijing.  \u201cI don\u2019t want China dictating to me and this was a call put in to me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was a very nice call. Short. And why should some other nation be able to say I can\u2019t take a call?\u201d \u201cI think it actually would\u2019ve been very disrespectful, to be honest with you, not taking it,\u201d he added. The president-elect also returned to some of the themes on which he criticised China during the election campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation, with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don\u2019t tax them, with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn\u2019t be doing, and frankly with not helping us at all with North Korea,\u201d he told Fox News.  \u201cYou have North Korea. You have nuclear weapons and China could solve that problem and they\u2019re not helping us at all.\u201d         Trump speaks on Fox News on Sunday.    Nick Bisley, an international relations expert from La Trobe University in Melbourne, said: \u201cThe signal Trump is sending to China is: \u2018You are not going to push us around; you are not going to dictate terms; we are going to be the ones who dictate terms to you\u2019. And he\u2019s also signalling, whether deliberately or not, that there are no sacred cows in US foreign policy, whether in Asia or anywhere else.\u201d  Bisley said Trump\u2019s early moves would have China\u2019s leaders, who had anticipated dealing with a predictable \u201cObama 3.0\u201d under a Clinton administration, scratching their heads.  \u201cI think they will be genuinely befuddled and just thinking: \u2018How do we deal with this guy? What\u2019s the playbook?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall consequence of all of this is that it\u2019s going to make the region a lot more uncertain and the temperature is going to be a lot higher.\u201d Li Yonghui, the head of the school of international relations at the Beijing Foreign Studies University, said Trump was \u201ctesting the water\u201d with China before taking office next month.  \u201cIt fits with the logic of a businessman. But on this issue, he has really gone off in the wrong direction. If he doesn\u2019t understand the nature of the Taiwan issue then sooner or later he will.

Trump\u2019s willingness to upset the global balance of power and roll the strategic dice so dramatically heralds a new age of uncertainty in international relations.

He knows exactly what he's doing | Richard Wolffe    Trump\u2019s statement on Sunday linking continued US adherence to the One China policy to other problematic issues, such as trade and currency, will be deeply alarming for Beijing.  In its toughest riposte to date, Geng Shuang, foreign ministry spokesman, said \u201cthe sound and steady growth of China-US relations [was] out of the question\u201d were Trump to persist with his approach. \u201cWe urge the incoming US administration \u2026 to properly deal with Taiwan-related matters in a prudent manner,\u201d Geng said.  Trump and prudence are not traditional bedfellows. Far from soothing Beijing\u2019s fears following his protocol-shredding telephone call with Taiwan\u2019s president, he deliberately escalated the row. Maybe Trump was trying to justify his earlier gaffe; maybe his sense of self-importance was punctured. Nobody could tell him who he may and may not speak to, he said.  Or maybe Trump was placing China on notice that unless he obtained more balanced trade and jobs, the US would deem all aspects of the bilateral relationship \u2013 including regional security, China\u2019s military buildup and cooperation over the threat posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme \u2013 up for review.  \u201cWe\u2019re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation, with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don\u2019t tax them, with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn\u2019t be doing, and frankly with not helping us at all with North Korea,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou have North Korea, you have nuclear weapons, and China could solve that problem and they\u2019re not helping us at all.\u201d  Chinese leaders \u2013 from the president, Xi Jinping, down \u2013 have not yet decided how to deal with Trump. His post-election outbursts have evidently caught them off-guard. State media and tame pro-government academics are increasingly aggressive in their response. But party bosses still seem to be hoping things will calm down as Trump settles into office.  That may be a serious misreading. Trump is already engaged in a furious battle with his own intelligence community, notably the CIA, and moderate Republican and Democratic members of Congress. There is little reason to believe he will tread more gently with with his favourite campaign target, China \u2013 at least in the short term.  But there could also be method in the apparent madness. By seeking warmer ties with Russia, Trump may be hoping China catches a cold. This is the identical gambit, played backwards, that was employed by Nixon and Henry Kissinger, his national security adviser, to clip the wings of the Soviet Union at the height of the cold war. On this reading, Trump is playing the \u201cRussia card\u201d against Beijing.  The risks that this strategy will backfire are huge. Xi is not the sort of leader to appease Trump; China has its own pragmatic, business-like relationship with Putin\u2019s Russia; the two countries will not be easily estranged. And in any case, China does not accept the justice of Trump\u2019s claims about currency manipulation and unfair tariffs. And then there is Taiwan.  Xi may decide instead to meet fire with fire. Threatening Chinese military air manoeuvres close to Taiwan and the Ryukyu islands at the weekend \u2013 the second such event in two weeks \u2013 led to a rapid mobilisation of Taiwanese and Japanese air and missile forces.

Jessica Chen Weiss, an expert in Chinese foreign policy and politics from Cornell University, said the increasingly tough language coming out of Beijing was part of a campaign to \u201ceducate\u201d Trump and his team before his inauguration on 20 January. If the president-elect refused to change tack, behind-the-scenes countermeasures might be rolled out to ensure the Republican understood the dangers of challenging China.  Weiss said Beijing would now be looking for \u201cpressure points that Trump might be responsive to\u201d, particularly on the economic front. \u201cYou can imagine China making its harder for American businesses in China to operate; nothing official, but certain actions that might serve as a warning to the US business community that this isn\u2019t going to end well if Trump continues,\u201d she said.  \u201cI don\u2019t think we are seeing that yet \u2013 I think it is likely to wait. It may well wait until Trump takes specific actions. It\u2019s one thing to question a policy or talk about revising it and it is another to take actions that indicate greater recognition for Taiwan as a sovereign state,\u201d Weiss added. Experts say Beijing has an array of weapons in its armoury with which it could respond to what it considers Trump\u2019s \u201cprovocations\u201d. They include weakening China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, in order to hurt US exporters, or seeking warming ties with North Korea and pumping economic aid into Pyongyang. There are fears in Taiwan, an independently and democratically ruled island to which Beijing lays claim, that it could face severe economic or political retaliation from China before the US is targeted. Possible measures against Taiwan include a diplomatic offensive which would see Beijing seek to seduce Taipei\u2019s already meagre stock of 22 allies which include Haiti, Paraguay and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, one of Africa\u2019s smallest nations.  Weiss said it remained unclear whether Trump would carry his \u201cwild talk\u201d on China into the White House. But the tycoon\u2019s arrival in power had raised the prospect of a dramatic and potentially catastrophic falling-out between the world\u2019s two largest economies.  \u201cIt could be a rupture in the US-China relationship that we haven\u2019t seen yet,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not at all optimistic\u201d.

French respondents were also widest of the mark when it came to the projected Muslim population in 2020. The average prediction was that Muslims would make up 40% of the French population in four years\u2019 time, almost five times the 8.3% Pew Research projection.  The French were not the only ones to hold such misconceptions: Italian, German and Belgian respondents all guessed that more than a fifth of the resident population was Muslim, while in reality the figure ranges from 3.7% in Italy to 7% in Belgium. All three countries also greatly overstated the expected proportion of Muslim residents in 2020.    Average responses to the question: 'Out of every 100 people in your country about how many do you think are Muslim?'   British respondents put the current Muslim population at 15%, three times the 2010 figure, while they overestimated the projected 2020 population by an even greater margin (22%versus an actual projection of 6%). In the US the average estimate was Muslims accounted for one in six people, whereas Pew put the actual figure at one in 100, while the future projection was even further off the mark.    Responses to the question: &quot;Now thinking about 2020, out of every 100 people in your country, about how many do you think will be Muslim?&quot;   Australian respondents\u2019 average estimate was that 12.5% of the country was Muslim, where the true figure is 2.4%. Their future projection of 21% was far off the actual projection of 3%.  The survey also explored how well people were able to gauge national attitudes to abortion, homosexuality and sex before marriage, by asking respondents what proportion of the population personally considered them morally unacceptable. The Dutch were furthest from the correct answer on all three questions: respondents expected personal objections to abortion to run at 37%, when in reality just 8% find abortion morally unacceptable.  And while just 5% of Dutch people personally believe that sex before marriage or homosexuality are morally unacceptable, respondents expected that 34% and 36% of people respectively thought that way. Conversely, Indonesian respondents thought the proportion of those opposed to homosexuality would be 79%, whereas the actual figure is 93%.  Elsewhere the survey asked respondents to put a figure on the percentage of people in their country who considered themselves happy. In every country for which data was available, respondents vastly underestimated self-reported happiness. Canadians were closest, although even they were pretty wide of the mark: respondents guessed that 60% of their compatriots would say they were happy. In fact, 87% identified as such. South Koreans hugely underestimated the rate of national happiness, estimating that just 24% of people would say they were happy, a far cry from the 90% of people who said they were \u201chappy\u201d or \u201crather happy\u201d in a 2010 survey.   Related: Why 2016 is the year the public got things wrong    The survey, which was conducted in the run-up to the US election, also asked people who they believed would win. Respondents in all but three countries expected Hilary Clinton to win.  Those who plumped for Donald Trump were Russia (where half of respondents said he would win, compared with 29% who thought Clinton would be the victor), Serbia (42% Trump, 29% Clinton) and China (32% Trump, 28% Clinton). The remaining respondents said they didn\u2019t know who would win the election.

Donald Trump\u2019s choice of the ExxonMobil chief was \u201c100% good news\u201d for Vladimir Putin, one opposition politician claimed. But in Beijing, already reeling from Trump\u2019s early forays into foreign policy, the move has inspired no such celebration, instead fuelling fears that the president-elect\u2019s courtship of the Kremlin could be part of a bold strategic bid to isolate China. \u201cHe\u2019s a very adventurous strategist,\u201d Shi Yinhong, a foreign policy specialist from Renmin University, said of the incoming president who has already enraged Beijing by threatening to upend decades of US policy towards China.  \u201cIf Mr Putin and Mr Trump become great friends then China can do nothing about it \u2013 but China will be prepared for some degree of alienation between Moscow and Beijing.\u201d  Growing Chinese angst that the Republican might take a harder line on China and seek to drive a wedge between it and Russia was on display on Wednesday in the editorial pages of the Global Times, a state-run tabloid. The newspaper played down what it said were public \u201cconcerns\u201d that warmer ties between Trump and Putin might harm the Sino-Russian relationship but admitted such thinking was \u201cnot ridiculous\u201d. \u201c[China and Russia] will keep going forward side by side,\u201d the newspaper insisted. John Delury, an associate professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University, said that within Chinese foreign policy circles Tillerson\u2019s nomination was seen as clear evidence of Trump\u2019s \u201ctilt to Russia\u201d.  The oil industry veteran has made at least five trips to China since 2008, most recently in July when he met with Wang Yilin, a longtime Communist party member who is the chairman of state-run energy giant China National Petroleum Corp.  But Tillerson, who has opposed US sanctions against Moscow, enjoys far deeper connections to Russia. The ExxonMobil chief is reportedly a personal friend of Igor Sechin, a Russian official considered the country\u2019s second-most powerful man after Putin, and was awarded the Russian Order of Friendship in 2013 after striking a drilling deal with state-run oil giant Rosneft.            Who is Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson?    Delury said that even before Tillerson\u2019s nomination policy wonks in Beijing had raised their eyebrows at how Trump was sending \u201cloving signals to Moscow\u201d but showing no such tenderness to China\u2019s President Xi Jinping.  \u201cThey are very much aware of a double standard in how Trump seems to embrace Putin and at best keep Xi Jinping at arms length, if not seem to want a combative relationship. \u201cIt does suggest that there is geopolitics behind this. It is obviously not informed by values: if Trump likes strongmen \u2013 as he was accused of \u2013 then he should like Xi Jinping as much he likes Putin.\u201d China has offered a tepid official response to Tillerson\u2019s nomination.  \u201cWe have noted the relevant reports,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang told reporters, adding that Beijing was \u201cwilling to work with the secretary of state, whoever it is, to move China-US relations forwards\u201d. However, some observers say China\u2019s leaders will be alarmed at the possibility that Trump is seeking to play Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201cChina card\u201d in reverse by wooing Moscow while treating Beijing mean. In 1972, in an audacious bid to isolate the Soviets, Nixon and Henry Kissinger travelled to China to seal a historic rapprochement with Mao Zedong.  \u201cI know that you are one who sees when an opportunity comes, and then knows that you must seize the hour and seize the day,\u201d Nixon told Chairman Mao, paraphrasing one of the revolutionary\u2019s own poems. Now, some believe Trump may be hoping to do the exact opposite: cut an increasingly assertive China down to size by luring Moscow away from its embrace.  \u201cI think that is Trump\u2019s intention,\u201d said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist professor from Hong Kong\u2019s Baptist University who believes the billionaire president-elect would like to \u201cdetach\u201d Moscow from Beijing.  Political and economic ties between Beijing and Moscow have blossomed since Xi became president in 2013 with the Chinese leader painting the two countries as \u201cfriends forever\u201d. Last year Putin was guest of honour at a massive military parade in Tiananmen Square, appearing on the rostrum on Xi\u2019s right.  Even so, Shi Yinhong said he could see how the Russian leader might be tempted by the carrot Trump was dangling before his nose: improved relations with Washington, and possibly Brussels, an end to economic sanctions, and the ability to reduce Moscow\u2019s dependency on China. \u201cMr Putin will be very pleased [by this],\u201d he said. Delury said he would not be surprised if President Trump chose to visit Russia before flying in to Beijing. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for leverage with the Chinese and he\u2019s trying to needle them. He\u2019s already getting under their skin with Taiwan and I suppose he could try a Moscow trip too.\u201d It was even possible Trump might use such a trip to further undermine Beijing by holding talks with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un on the sidelines of a meeting in the Russian capital.  \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of brave new world we could be entering,\u201d Delury said. \u201cBeijing would not like that. It would be a brash move and it would put Beijing in a tough spot because they do want dialogue \u2026 and they are always telling the Americans you\u2019ve got to talk to Pyongyang. But if it happened in Moscow without them there and with them kind of in the dark \u2026 that could give them a little heartburn.\u201d But the American scholar said he was unconvinced Trump would manage to break the bond between Russia and China by pursuing an \u201cupside-down Nixon strategy\u201d. \u201cPutin is going to go along for the ride a little bit but Putin doesn\u2019t want a breakdown in relations with China,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe reason it all worked in the Seventies was the Sino-Soviet split. Nixon could do what he did because China and the Soviets were enemies. They were ready to go to war. That isn\u2019t the situation at all today.\u201d "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/14/democratic-operating-systems-upgrade-voting-overhaul", "publicationDate": "2016-12-14T09:00:21Z", "tags": ["Electoral reform", "Technology", "Politics", "Iceland", "Argentina", "World news"], "sentences": ["These organisations include pol.is, an artificial-intelligence powered tool that has helped involve large numbers of people in Taiwan in shaping legislation; and DemocracyOS, an Argentinian platform that has had a party represented in government, making decisions based on the public\u2019s will through an online platform."], "title": "Our democratic operating systems aren\u2019t working: here\u2019s how to upgrade them | Jon Barnes", "article": "Worried about his children\u2019s future and angry about the diminishing level of citizen participation in politics, the Australian entrepreneur Adam Jacoby decided to stop moaning on Twitter and do something about it. He founded MiVote, a tech startup that is creating a form of super-democracy.   Related: Mob rule: Iceland crowdsources its next constitution    When an issue is raised in parliament, citizens are asked to participate in the decision-making. Rather than voting yes or no, MiVote\u2019s users are asked a far more nuanced question that takes a long-term view. When I interviewed him, Jacoby explained this concept in more detail, using the issue of immigration as an example: \u201cThe vote would be, \u2018Would you like the government, the country, to take a primarily humanitarian approach to asylum seekers or immigration? Would you like it to take security approach? Would you like it to take a financially pragmatic approach? Or would you like it to take an international diplomacy approach?,\u2019\u201d he said. The platform presents a range of research sourced in partnership with universities and other advisers. Typically, it outlines four different positions. Citizens can then vote for as many or as few as they want to. MiVote is totally neutral regarding the decisions made. This is what I call MiVote\u2019s \u201cnon-ideology ideology\u201d. And that is because its creators understand the ways in which the system we use now aren\u2019t equipped to deal with nuance. They understand that informed constituencies can make direct decisions, rather than just electing somebody to elect somebody to make decisions for them.    I would like to see a conversation emerge not about the decisions, but the process by which these decisions are made    This is not to say that I envisage a future without any elected representatives. It may well be that the future of politics doesn\u2019t need politicians. I don\u2019t know. What I do know is that technology can create more direct forms of democracy in which citizens are more deeply involved. MiVote belongs to a new breed of organisations and projects looking to move democracy into the 21st century. These organisations include pol.is, an artificial-intelligence powered tool that has helped involve large numbers of people in Taiwan in shaping legislation; and DemocracyOS, an Argentinian platform that has had a party represented in government, making decisions based on the public\u2019s will through an online platform. Iceland \u201ccrowdsourced\u201d its constitution, involving more than 40,000 people in the process and receiving an approval rating of over 70%. In Estonia the platform e-Residency has changed several laws in just a few months by listening to the feedback of citizens around the world. In our digital age, we need to upgrade our democratic operating system. In the wake of the contradictory and surprising decisions we\u2019ve seen taken this year, I would like to see a conversation emerge not about the decisions, but the process by which these decisions are made.   Related: Estonia offers e-residency to foreigners    Of course technology hasn\u2019t always helped our democracies to function. Filter bubbles and fake news have been blamed for recent events including the vote for Brexit and the election of Donald Trump. But this is a problem to be fixed, not an excuse to hold on to an old system we\u2019ve had for hundreds of years purely because that\u2019s the way things are. To me, the events of this year are signs that our antiquated system is in desperate need of an overhaul, because it doesn\u2019t allow us to express ourselves other than in binary terms: red v blue; in v out; him v her. The complexity of the modern world is lost in a democratic process dominated by political parties wedded to pre-determined ideologies, rather than to enacting the will of the people. Pre-internet, when pen and paper were the pinnacle of democratic technology, it made sense to outsource our decisions to \u201cexperts\u201d, but in 2016 we have far more sophisticated tools that can cope with the complexity of the modern day. The existence of this technology requires us to rethink the different roles in our systems of government. As Jacoby says: \u201cThere is no excuse in 2016, when you can have a many-to-many and many-to-one conversation, not to have a conversation with our electorate on every issue. There is just simply no excuse for it.\u201d Democracy has seen little change since Sir Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web 25 years ago, and it is time for a change: to a more direct, more frequent, more human-centred, more participatory, more informed form of democracy.

Jean-Marc Ayrault was responding to Trump\u2019s threats of a trade or currency war with China, as well as his surprise decision to speak directly by phone to the Taiwan president, Tsai Ing-wen. Beijing lodged a complaint over the phone call, which it saw as a breach of the \u201cone China\u201d principle that officially considers the independently governed island to be part of the same single Chinese nation as the mainland.

There may be disagreements with China, but we do not talk like that to a partner. We must avoid getting into a spiral where things are out of control. \u201cWhen China feels challenged on its unity, that is not necessarily very clever.

Broadly, the view in France is that Trump has little to gain from a downturn in relations with China when so much else needs to be addressed in Europe and the Middle East. French politicians are anxious that Trump does not seek to tear up the Iran nuclear deal and have noticed that China has been publicly advising the US not to do so.  On Monday, China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, urged all sides to stick to the six-nation pact agreed last year. Without mentioning the US directly, Wang said: \u201cMaintaining the deal\u2019s continued, comprehensive and effective implementation is the responsibility and common interest of all parties, and should not be impacted by changes in the internal situation of each country.\u201d Ayrault has a history of speaking his mind, having accused the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, of lying during the EU referendum campaign. In an interview with CNN during the US presidential election campaign, he described Trump\u2019s foreign policy plans as \u201cvery confused\u201d. On Wednesday, he said the Trump administration would be judged by its deeds, but the US president-elect had selected \u201can unusual team after an unusual election\u201d. Although the polls suggest that Ayrault\u2019s Socialist party is highly unlikely to retain the presidency in the French election next year, it is difficult to predict how Trump will react to being lectured in public on the art of diplomacy.  He is more likely to find a political soulmate in the rightwing candidate Francois Fillon, the favourite for the presidency.

No other benchmark of success really matters, and it can be measured by anyone who can count dollars by the billion. Success as the nation\u2019s top diplomat will be harder to assess. What price is to be put on \u201cUS values\u201d \u2013 human rights, and what is the rate of exchange of those objectives with national security? There will be no shortage of opponents and rivals, in his own administration and probably in his own department, who will be counting minuses where he sees pluses or using entirely different units of measurement.  There is rarely just a buyer and seller in diplomacy. In the many global crises that await Tillerson and all those still to come that will rear up in his face, there will be a tangle of interlocking interests that defy \u201cdealmaking\u201d. That is especially true in a situation where some of the main elements of Trumpian foreign policy contradict one another. The in-tray will be overflowing and messy.   Related: 'Friends forever'? China wary of Rex Tillerson wooing away Russia    North Korea Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime in Pyongyang is working towards the capability to put a compact nuclear warhead on a long-range missile that can reach the US west coast. Any military attempt to pre-empt its progress is likely to draw a ferocious, and probably nuclear, response, aimed at US allies and bases in the region. Aware of this, one of those allies, South Korea, may start to consider building its own bomb if it feels US commitment to its defence is weakening. Trump has indicated he wants to solve the problem by having China put pressure on North Korea. As secretary of state, Tillerson would have to figure out how to pursue that policy while at the same time addressing another Trump priority: confronting China. China Trump has already triggered a crisis in US-China relations during the transition by talking to the Taiwanese president and casting doubt on the 37-year-old One China policy that withholds recognition of Taiwan\u2019s independence. Beijing has signalled that it would respond dramatically if the One China principle is abandoned. The fury of the reaction could be compounded if Trump carries out his threats to declare China a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d and therefore impose heavy tariffs on Chinese imports. Early on in the administration, Tillerson is likely to be called on to prevent the crisis turning into a trade war or worse, in the knowledge that Chinese and US forces are already brushing up close to each other in the South China Sea. Europe, Nato and Russia  Washington\u2019s oldest allies in Europe are deeply nervous about Trump\u2019s ties to Moscow, his commitment to fulfilling US obligations to Nato and his attitude towards the European Union, given his enthusiasm for Brexit and links to the European hard right. The anxiety will have been amplified by Tillerson\u2019s own history of Kremlin hobnobbing, and fears that a businessman\u2019s transactional approach would lead to bargaining away collective security at the edges of the alliance and drifting towards Moscow\u2019s agenda of reestablishing a sphere of influence in eastern Europe. Most European governments are seeking an unequivocal statement of faith in the EU and Nato, and a united front against Moscow over its military intervention in Ukraine until it abides by the Minsk agreement on defusing the conflict. Will Tillerson\u2019s boss be prepared to give these assurances? If not, there will be a lot of fallout to manage.      Vladimir Putin presents Rex Tillerson with the Order of Friendship at the St Petersburg economic forum in June 2013. Photograph: Mikhail Klimentyev/Tass    Iran  The national security leaders Trump has picked so far are determined to push back against Iran\u2019s influence in the Middle East, its support for militant groups and its missile programme. There is strong support in Congress for such a policy. The open question is whether it should involve Washington walking away from last year\u2019s nuclear deal. That could lead to Iranian retaliation, declaring itself no longer bound by the agreed curbs on its nuclear activities. If it aggressively pursued uranium enrichment, that would put the prospect of war back on the table. US abrogation of the deal would also create a rift with the western Europeans, Russia and China, the agreement\u2019s co-signatories, which would have to be managed. It would undermine faith in the value of a US signature on agreements, weakening efforts to reach a nuclear or missile agreement with North Korea, for example.  Syria and counterterrorism The direction that Trump and his incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn have mapped out in Syria is aimed at a purely counter-terrorism approach, involving possible cooperation with Russia and the Syrian regime. A number of unanswered questions about this policy would have to be resolved from the start and most likely the secretary of state would be asked to do the resolution. Firstly, making common cause with two parties responsible for indiscriminate mass bombing of civilians and potentially many other war crimes would appall some European allies and provide a powerful recruitment tool for jihadists in Syria and around the world. It would also involve military cooperation with Iran and furthering the Iranian strategic aim of carving out a corridor from Iran to Lebanon, which runs counter to the strategic aim of pushing back Tehran\u2019s influence. That would run into heavy resistance in Congress and in the Pentagon, where any collaboration with Russian forces would require a special waiver from the defence secretary, James Mattis. In this matter, and many others, Tillerson would require diplomatic skills inside Washington as much as he would need them abroad."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/16/syria-aleppo-evacuation-obama-russia", "publicationDate": "2016-12-16T13:46:28Z", "tags": ["Syria", "World news"], "sentences": ["Barack Obama promises retaliation against Russia over hacking during US election           US will retaliate against Russia over election hacking, vows Barack Obama \u2013 audio    China live-fires aircraft carrier group China\u2019s Liaoning aircraft carrier battle group has conducted its first exercises with live ammunition, the country\u2019s navy said, in a show of strength as tensions with the US and Taiwan escalate.", "The drills come as a heated war of words intensifies between Beijing and Trump, who broke convention by speaking with the president of Taiwan and questioning the decades-old \u201cOne China\u201d policy.", "China live-fires aircraft carrier group amid Taiwan tensions with US Dylann Roof guilty in church shooting A South Carolina jury has found Dylann Roof, the self-avowed white supremacist who killed nine black parishioners in a Charleston church in June 2015, guilty of all 33 federal charges he faced, including murder, attempted murder, hate crimes and obstruction of religion, on Thursday."], "title": "Rebels obstruct Aleppo evacuation | The daily briefing", "article": "  Aleppo evacuation suspended A deal to evacuate tens of thousands of civilians from the besieged districts of east Aleppo in Syria has been suspended and is at risk of unravelling after Islamist rebels in Idlib province refused to allow a simultaneous evacuation of the wounded in two pro-government villages.

The nine-month investigation into police files and court documents found hundreds of cases of alleged sexual abuse by a total of 115 coaches and other adults they worked with, and systematic failures which enabled accused coaches to relocate to other gyms. Nearly all of the victims were girls. One coach was found to have made 469 videos of 49 gymnasts he coached, all girls from eight to 16 years old, using secret cameras he placed in changing rooms.

The ride-sharing company launched semi-autonomous vehicles in San Francisco without permits this week and was ordered by the California department of motor vehicles to immediately remove the cars from the road or face legal action. This came on the same day that numerous cars were caught running red lights, which Uber said was due to \u201chuman error\u201d.

But Beijing has so far proved rather more predictable than the president-elect of the US. Since Donald Trump sought to rattle its cage by sharing a phone call with Taiwan\u2019s president Tsai Ing-wen and questioning the \u201cone-China\u201d policy which has underpinned bilateral relations for decades, it has responded in ways familiar to China-watchers: careful official statements of\u00a0displeasure, sabre-rattling in a populist state-owned tabloid, and a series of actions which could be coincidental but send a convenient message. Those include the first live-fire exercises by China\u2019s aircraft carrier group, the warning that a US carmaker could face fines for monopolistic behaviour, and the scooping up of the oceanographic survey ship\u2019s drone. It has so far moved with caution. But the risks created by Mr Trump\u2019s behaviour are real and substantial. In reality, Taiwan has been self-ruled since Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s Kuomintang (KMT) fled there at the end of the civil war in 1949. But the three-cornered relationship has long been governed by polite fictions. The US acknowledges the belief that there is only one China; Taipei and Beijing have said there is only one China, but how one interprets that is a matter of deliberate ambiguity. These diplomatic acts of imagination are peculiar: Washington has security ties with the entity which it does not recognise diplomatically, to protect it from the one it does recognise. But they have smoothed Sino-US relations and stabilised cross-straits relations. The US role has essentially been to help maintain the status quo should either side try to veer away. Under the previous KMT president, Ma Ying-jeou, cross-straits ties grew quickly, bringing economic benefits but also concern: while few on Taiwan want formal independence, many more were concerned about Beijing\u2019s influence. China did not want the election of the Democratic Progressive party\u2019s Tsai Ing-wen, and appears to have made itself felt in significant but deniable ways \u2013 tourist numbers are down and Taiwan was not invited to this year\u2019s meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, despite attending previously. But it has not, for example, repudiated the agreements signed with Mr Ma. The experienced Ms Tsai has so far played a careful hand and has\u00a0indicated her desire for good relations. But there is always a risk that action by Beijing and domestic political pressure might\u00a0push her further. There is a reasonable case to be made that the US should be more vocal in supporting Taiwan, a thriving democracy overseen by the only woman ever elected to top office in Asia without a political dynasty behind her, to discourage Beijing from trying to disturb the present balance. Advocates say that China\u2019s growing military power means that challenge should come sooner not later. But that does not appear to be what Mr Trump is doing. Putting aside the possibility that he is acting on whim \u2013 this call appears to have been well-planned \u2013 there are three theses about the president-elect\u2019s intentions. The first is that he is bringing his business tactics to diplomacy, seeing what advantages he can accrue by throwing his weight around and being unpredictable. The second is that he plans a \u201creverse-Nixon\u201d, cosying up to Moscow while encouraging it to distance itself from Beijing. His advisers are hawkish towards Beijing, and the Sino-Soviet relationship has always been one of convenience rather than love, scarred by deep suspicion and repeated separations. Taiwan could become a stick to beat China,\u00a0using the sinophobia he embraced in his campaign to bolster his popularity in office. But while Beijing fosters and manipulates popular nationalism, it does not\u00a0control it and must also answer to it; Taiwan is an issue on which both leaders and\u00a0people feel extremely strongly. There is a\u00a0profound risk of destabilising the region, and of miscalculations and missteps escalating the situation. Even if that peril is avoided, the long-term future of Taiwan matters much more to Beijing than Washington. Beijing is likely to react angrily and seek to punish the US \u2013 but will find it even easier to punish Taiwan. That leads to the third possibility: that Mr Trump wants to use the island as leverage \u2013 as he suggested explicitly, tweeting that \u201cI don\u2019t know why we have to be bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with\u00a0China having to do with other things\u201d. But Taiwan deserves better than to be used as\u00a0a cudgel or a bargaining chip."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/16/obama-syria-assad-aleppo-final-press-conference", "publicationDate": "2016-12-16T23:51:37Z", "tags": ["Barack Obama", "Syria", "Aleppo", "US politics", "US news", "Obama administration", "Middle East and North Africa"], "sentences": ["Trump has said he would not feel bound by the decades-old policy in which the US recognises Taiwan as part of China."], "title": "Obama reflects on Syria at farewell press conference: 'I always feel responsible'", "article": "Barack Obama said on Friday the Syrian regime and its allies had \u201cblood on their hands\u201d as he reflected on eight years in office with a humbling admission about the limits of presidential power. At his longest and probably last press conference at the White House before making way for Donald Trump, Obama became emotional as he spoke of feeling responsible when children in Syria are killed by snipers or atrocities are committed around the world. The president who began his tenure winning the Nobel peace prize ended it in a throwback to the cold war, condemning President Vladimir Putin not only over Russia\u2019s aggression in Aleppo but also regarding cyber-attacks on the US presidential election. Obama had personally told Putin to \u201ccut it out\u201d, he said.   Related: Obama says he warned Russia to 'cut it out' over election hacking    The press briefing room at the White House was so crowded for Obama\u2019s final end-of-year summation that one journalist fainted and required medical attention. Although the first African American president reeled off a list of achievements, from reducing unemployment to expanding healthcare to rapprochement with Cuba, as proof that the US is significantly better off than when he succeeded George W Bush in 2009, it has been increasingly evident Syria will cast a shadow on his legacy. \u201cThe world as we speak is united in horror at the savage assaults by the Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian allies on the city of Aleppo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen a deliberate strategy of surrounding, besieging and starving innocent civilians. We\u2019ve seen relentless targeting of humanitarian workers and medical personnel, [neighborhoods] reduced to rubble and dust. There are continuing reports of civilians being executed. These are all horrific violations of international law.\u201d He added forcefully: \u201cResponsibility for this brutality lies in one place alone, with the Assad regime and its allies, Russia and Iran, and this blood and these atrocities are on their hands.\u201d The near six-year civil war in Syria has been an intractable problem for Obama, who was widely criticised for drawing a \u201cred line\u201d over the use of chemical weapons then failing to enforce it. The president called for an impartial international observer force in Aleppo, full access for humanitarian aid and a broad ceasefire.            Aleppo is now a synonym for hell, says UN secretary general    He was asked if he felt any personal moral responsibility at the end of his presidency for the carnage of Aleppo. \u201cI always feel responsible,\u201d the president replied. \u201cI felt responsible when kids were being shot by snipers. I felt responsible when millions of people had been displaced. I feel responsible for murder and slaughter that\u2019s taken place in South Sudan that\u2019s not being reported on, partly because there\u2019s not as much social media being generated from there. \u201cThere are places around the world where horrible things are happening and because of my office, because I\u2019m president of the United States, I feel responsible. I ask myself every single day, is there something I could do that would save lives and make a difference and spare some child who doesn\u2019t deserve to suffer? So that\u2019s a starting point. There\u2019s not a moment during the course of this presidency where I haven\u2019t felt some responsibility.\u201d But weeks\u2019 worth of meetings with military officials, aid agencies, diplomats and outside critics failed to find a solution, he confessed. There was no appetite for sending in large numbers of US troops without an international law mandate or support from Congress when there will still boots on the ground in Iraq after a decade of war that cost trillions of dollars. There would also be confrontation with \u201cmilitary superpower\u201d in Russia and Iran.    There\u2019s not a moment during the course of this presidency where I haven\u2019t felt some responsibility.  Barack Obama     \u201cAnd in that circumstance, unless we were all in and willing to take over Syria, we were going to have problems. And everything else was tempting because we wanted to do something and it sounded like the right thing to do but it was going to be impossible to do this on the cheap. And in that circumstance, I have to make decision as president of the United States as to what is best. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Contrary to the claims of Russia and the Bashar al-Assad regime, he said, tens of thousands of people were still trapped in Aleppo and prepared to leave under any conditions. The US would continue to put pressure to get them out. Trump, who will be inaugurated on 20 January, has called for the creation of \u201csafe zones\u201d in Syria. Asked for his view, Obama said: \u201cI will help President-elect Trump with any advice, counsel, information that we can provide so that he, once he\u2019s sworn in, can make a decision.\u201d     Barack Obama takes questions at the year-end press conference at the White House in Washington. Photograph: Zach Gibson/AFP/Getty Images    Putin also dominated Obama\u2019s remarks about the US presidential election following reports that US intelligence agencies believe he personally directed the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairperson, John Podesta. He said he spoke with Putin in September and told him to \u201ccut it out\u201d. It seemed to work, he added, but by then Podesta\u2019s emails were already in the possession of WikiLeaks. He criticised Republicans for warming to Putin, suggesting that they were helping Russia undermine American democracy. Although Russia, he said, was a weaker country that did not innovate, he noted frankly: \u201cMr Putin can weaken us just like he\u2019s trying to weaken Europe if we start buying into notions that it\u2019s OK to intimidate the press, or lock up dissidents, or discriminate against people because of their faith or what they look like.   Related: Google, democracy and the truth about internet search    \u201cWhat I worry about \u2013 more than anything \u2013 is the degree to which because of the fierceness, because of the partisan battle, you start to see certain folks in the Republican party and Republican voters suddenly finding a government and individuals who stand contrary to everything that we stand for as being OK, because that\u2019s how much we dislike Democrats.\u201d Referring to a president revered by Republicans for winning the cold war, he added: \u201cRonald Reagan would roll over in his grave.\u201d And in one of several digs at the media, he remarked: \u201cIf fake news being released by some foreign government is almost identical to reports that are being issued through partisan news venues, then it\u2019s not surprising that that foreign propaganda will have a greater effect, because it doesn\u2019t seem so far-fetched.\u201d But throughout the press conference, Obama studiously avoided direct criticisms of Trump, describing him as \u201cstill in transition mode\u201d. He said their telephone conversations were \u201ccordial\u201d and not \u201cdefensive in any way\u201d. He said he advised Trump to \u201cthink it through\u201d before making any changes to the \u201cone-China\u201d policy.

Speaking on Friday at what is likely to be his last White House news conference Obama urged his successor to beware of provoking a \u201cvery significant\u201d response from Beijing over Taiwan. The past two weeks have seen Trump take a series of public swipes at China, accusing Beijing of manipulating its currency, building \u201ca massive fortress\u201d in the South China Sea and not doing enough to pressure Kim Jong-un\u2019s North Korea. Most controversially of all, the billionaire has also hinted he might upend nearly four decades of US-China ties by offering greater recognition to the government of Taiwan, a self-ruled island that Beijing views as a breakaway province. Trump\u2019s questioning of the so-called \u201cOne China\u201d principle move drew protests from Beijing and led one state-run newspaper to call for swift preparations for a military invasion of the democratically governed island.

They won\u2019t even treat it the way they treat issues around the South China Sea, where we have had a lot of tensions. This goes to the core of how they see themselves and their reaction on this issue could end up being very significant.\u201d Obama said the importance of US-China collaboration in areas such as the global economy, security and international affairs was now such that \u201cthere is probably no bilateral relationship that carries more significance\u201d.  \u201cAnd where there is also the potential \u2013 if that relationship breaks down or goes into a full conflict mode \u2013 that everybody is worse off,\u201d the outgoing president added.  Foreign policy specialists on both sides of the Pacific have expressed concern at the potential for upheaval if Trump\u2019s early forays into China policy continue after he takes office on 20 January. \u201cI think the Chinese are quite concerned,\u201d said Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China power project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank in Washington.  \u201cPublicly, they have been rather restrained but they know that they have a little bit over four weeks before this guy gets sworn in and I think they believe they need to educate him on what China\u2019s core interests are and the risks of actually threatening them.\u201d Glaser said Chinese diplomats were now \u201cscrambling to try to figure out who is going to be in key positions [and] whether they are going to have any \u2018friendlies\u2019\u201d in the Trump administration.  \u201cThe Chinese are smart enough to know that if they are very tough, in a rhetorically retaliatory way, against Trump then that will probably just make him angry. It\u2019s not the way to deal with Trump. You don\u2019t criticise him publicly, not personally. So I think [at the moment] they are trying to find ways to educate him and influence him and his team without creating a downwards spiral in the relationship.\u201d Orville Schell, the head of the Centre on US-China Relations at New York\u2019s Asia Society, said that by threatening to defy Beijing over Taiwan Trump had \u201cbearded the dragon\u201d.  \u201cHe has probed the most sensitive nerve in US-China relations \u2013 the territorial integrity of the motherland and the idea of the inevitable return of Taiwan to the motherland\u2019s embrace.\u201d  \u201cI am intrigued with Trump\u2019s ability to disequilibrate what was something of a standoff [between the US and China],\u201d Schell added.  \u201c[Obama\u2019s] virtue was to try to be consistent, steadfast and not to react too much from the gut and too emotionally.

As president-elect, Trump has so far nominated a number of billionaires, three Goldman Sachs bankers and the chief executive of the world\u2019s largest oil firm to senior positions. Responding to liberal consternation at the sheer wealth of the prospective appointees, Trump told his audience: \u201cA newspaper [the New York Times] criticised me and said: \u2018Why can\u2019t they have people of modest means?\u2019 Because I want people that made a fortune. Because now they are negotiating for you, OK? It\u2019s no different than a great baseball player or a great golfer.\u201d Trump\u2019s cabinet, which is not yet fully filled, is already said to be worth a combined $14bn \u2013 the richest White House top table ever assembled. His team \u2013 if all are confirmed by the Senate \u2013 will be worth 50 times the $250m combined wealth of George W Bush\u2019s first cabinet, which the media at the time dubbed the \u201cteam of millionaires\u201d. For Trump, those figures are simply a confirmation of competence: in Trumpian politics, the richer you are, the better you must be at cutting a deal. And \u201cdeal-making\u201d is what the next White House will be all about. Throughout his campaign, Trump repeatedly returned to the theme of the \u201cterrible deals\u201d cut by previous administrations, from the North American Free Trade Agreement to the nuclear deal with Iran. He described Nafta, an agreement with Canada and Mexico, as \u201cthe worst trade deal maybe ever\u201d; the Iran nuclear pact was a \u201cdisaster\u201d and \u201cthe worst deal ever negotiated\u201d and would be \u201cripped up\u201d. China was called a \u201cbig abuser\u201d for artificially depressing its currency to give its exports a boost at the expense of US jobs. The implication was that, under the leadership of Trump, America Inc would finally begin to punch its weight in the market of global diplomacy. According to Peter Henning, a constitutional law professor at Wayne State University, appointing business leaders to top political positions has become the norm in American politics, but Trump\u2019s nominations were \u201cunique in the volume of people with minimal, if any, government experience\u201d. \u201cI am always wary of people who say \u2018we have to run the country like a business\u2019 \u2013 businesses aren\u2019t responsible for defence or caring for the elderly,\u201d he said. \u201cBusinesses are driven with one guiding principle \u2013 to make the most money \u2013 and that should not be the role of the government.\u201d     Secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson speaks in Washington. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP    The backlash has begun in earnest. The criticism Trump objected to in Des Moines came from a New York Times editorial questioning the Trump administration\u2019s seeming lack of interest in vetting nominees for potential conflicts of interest. Top Democrats and leading ethics and constitutional law experts have also raised concerns about Trump\u2019s selection process.   Related: Trump's conflicts of interest: a visual guide    Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who campaigned for the Democratic nomination and promised that, if elected, he would redistribute the vast wealth of the 1% to poorer families, has dubbed Trump\u2019s top team the \u201ccabinet of billionaires\u201d. \u201cI guess they have a few poor millionaires on it but, mostly, it is billionaires,\u201d Sanders said. He accused Trump of going back on his pledge to lead an anti-establishment revolution and \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d. \u201cIf the cabinet he appointed of billionaires and millionaires is anti-establishment, boy, I would hate to see what the \u2018establishment\u2019 looks like,\u201d Sanders said on NBC\u2019s Late Night with Seth Meyers. \u201cMaybe I am not seeing something here, but you don\u2019t appoint the head of ExxonMobil to be secretary of state. That is not quite taking on the establishment.\u201d It is the selection of Exxon\u2019s chief executive, Rex Tillerson, whom Trump described as \u201cone of the truly great business leaders of the world\u201d in an early morning tweet announcing his appointment as secretary of state, that has caused the most upset on both sides of the aisle.           Who is Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson?    As well as a phalanx of Democrats, the leading Republican senators Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham, and John McCain, the chairman of the Senate armed services committee, have raised concerns about Tillerson\u2019s close relationship with Vladimir Putin and conflicts of interest arising from Exxon\u2019s interests in Russia. Tillerson, 64, who has spent his whole career at the oil giant, was awarded Russia\u2019s Order of Friendship in 2013 after he agreed a deal with the state-owned oil company Rosneft, run by the Putin lieutenant Igor Sechin. The partnership to drill for oil in the Arctic and explore in Siberia and the Black Sea was iced following the imposition of sanctions on Russia when it annexed Crimea. It means that Exxon has tens of billions of potential Russian assets lying idle. Tillerson has $245m of Exxon stock. As secretary of state, Tillerson will be leading discussions on whether the US should maintain sanctions against Russia. He will also be forming America\u2019s policy on the Syria crisis, the Iran nuclear deal (which Trump has described as \u201cterrible\u201d), and relations with North Korea. \u201cWhen he gets the friendship award from a butcher, frankly, it\u2019s an issue that I think needs to be examined,\u201d McCain told Fox News. Rubio, who serves on the foreign relations committee that will vet Tillerson\u2019s nomination before a full Senate vote, has said he has \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the appointment. \u201cThe next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity, is free of potential conflicts of interest, has a clear sense of America\u2019s interests, and will be a forceful advocate for America\u2019s foreign policy goals to the president, within the administration, and on the world stage,\u201d he said. In its most recent session, the foreign relations committee was composed of 10 Republicans and nine Democrats, meaning that if Trump lost one Republican, Tillerson\u2019s appointment could be at least stalled. Other controversial big business appointments include Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs\u2019s president and chief operating officer, named as director of the National Economic Council \u2013 or, as Trump put it, his \u201ctop economic adviser\u201d. Trump said Cohn, who has worked at Goldman for 26 years and amassed some $200m of the bank\u2019s stock, would \u201cput his talents as a highly successful businessman to work for the American people\u201d. \u201cHe will help craft economic policies that will grow wages for our workers, stop the exodus of jobs overseas and create many great new opportunities for Americans who have been struggling.\u201d     Goldman Sachs president and chief Gary Cohn has been named as Trump\u2019s \u2018top economic adviser\u2019. Photograph: Andrew Kelly/Reuters    Cohn\u2019s appointment does not require Senate approval, and could serve as a stepping stone to other government positions at the US treasury or the Federal Reserve, a route that has been well trodden in the past. Trump\u2019s pick for treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is also a multimillionaire former Goldman banker who went on to be dubbed a \u201cforeclosure king\u201d for buying up distressed mortgages and evicting thousands of homeowners during the financial crisis.   Related: Donald Trump's talk of 'draining the swamp' rings hollow    Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democratic senator, called Mnuchin \u201cthe Forrest Gump of the financial crisis\u201d because he \u201cmanaged to participate in all the worst practices on Wall Street\u201d during his lengthy career. \u201cHis selection as treasury secretary should send shivers down the spine of every American who got hit hard by the financial crisis, and is the latest sign that Donald Trump has no intention of draining the swamp and every intention of running Washington to benefit himself and his rich buddies,\u201d she said. The selection of three Goldman bankers could open Trump up to criticism as, during the campaign, the president-elect repeatedly highlighted the bank as emblematic of the corrupt global elite that had stolen the futures of hard-working Americans. Days before the election, Trump launched a TV advert that portrayed the Goldman chairman and chief executive Lloyd Blankfein as the personification of the global elite, which he said had \u201crobbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities\u201d. Trump\u2019s ire against Goldman persisted throughout the campaign: he attacked Hillary Clinton for giving paid speeches to the bank and accused his Republican nomination rival Ted Cruz of being \u201cowned\u201d by Goldman because his wife worked at the bank. \u201cHe will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!\u201d Trump said in a January tweet. But beyond the accusations of brazen hypocrisy, it is the enmeshing of business interests with affairs of state which is causing the deepest concern. Jordan Libowitz, of the DC watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said Trump\u2019s cabinet had might have the most conflicts of interest in history. \u201cThere have been business leaders, and very rich ones, in the cabinet in the past but never of this depth and scale. The question is not whether he is seeking to run the White House like a business, but more whether he will be running it as his business. People will question whether the provocative actions he has taken so far are in the interests of the country or in the interests of his businesses.\u201d Libowitz said it could be argued that \u201cTrump is seeking to use the White House as an extension of Trump Tower. That\u2019s why we think that the only way to remove conflict of interest is for the Trump organisations to be sold outside of the family and the proceeds moved into a blind trust.\u201d   Related: How to contact the Guardian securely    Trump has given no indication that he will relinquish ownership of his global real estate and licensing empire. He has only pledged to make \u201cno new deals\u201d and hand over management to his sons, Donald Jr and Eric, who also have official roles on the transition team. Meanwhile, the billionaires continue to pack their bags for DC. The private equity billionaire Wilbur Ross has been nominated as commerce secretary with a mission \u201cto foster, promote, and develop the foreign and domestic commerce\u201d. Ross, 79, who was called a \u201cvulture investor\u201d for buying up failing companies, cutting jobs and flipping them for often huge profits, has amassed a $2.9bn fortune via his private equity firm, WL Ross &amp; Co. Ross last week agreed to buy a $12m seven-bedroom house on DC\u2019s leafy Woodland Drive, known as \u201cbillionaire\u2019s row\u201d. The 10,000-sq ft gatehouse has a 12-seat cinema and staff quarters, and sits opposite the home of the current commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker. Working with Ross as deputy commerce secretary will be Todd Ricketts, another billionaire and co-owner of the Chicago Cubs. He inherited his wealth from his billionaire father, Joe Ricketts, founder of the brokerage TD Ameritrade. The Ricketts family donated $1m to Trump\u2019s campaign. Another beneficiary of dynastic wealth nominated to serve under Trump is Betsy DeVos, the daughter-in-law of the Amway co-founder Richard DeVos, estimated by Forbes to be worth more than $5bn. \u201cI\u2019m not shocked by this,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019s a billionaire president being surrounded by a billionaire and millionaire cabinet, with a billionaire agenda \u2026 to hurt the middle class. The appointments suggest that he\u2019s going to break his campaign promises.\u201d Trump may feel secure in his picks, given Republican control of Congress, but there is no guarantee they will all make it into office. While Trump himself hasn\u2019t published his tax returns (despite a four-decade tradition of doing so) or sold any businesses that could represent a conflict of interest, his nominees\u2019 finances will undergo intense scrutiny. Senator Orrin Hatch, the finance committee chairman, said nominees \u201cwill undergo the same bipartisan vetting process as the nominees from previous administrations\u201d and will not progress to a public hearing until the committee has reviewed the past three years of a nominee\u2019s tax returns. The multi-page questionnaire asks nominees to list all jobs held since college, all business relationships, political activities and contributions, any legal or ethical conflicts and a calculation of the nominee and their family\u2019s net worth. They will also be under oath to declare if they have paid taxes, including those for household staff. The law requires that executive branch employees have no role in government matters that could benefit their financial interests or those of their families. It means they must give up any paid or unpaid jobs, including board positions, and sell stock. Meanwhile, as Trump is exempt from many of the laws that apply to his appointments, he is taking full advantage. He isn\u2019t even giving up the limelight of The New Celebrity Apprentice, where he will remain an executive producer while in office. \u201cPresidents have a right to do things in their spare time,\u201d his adviser Kellyanne Conway said. Another successful deal for the president-elect. DEAL OR NO DEAL? China      Trump angered Beijing when he took a call from Taiwan\u2019s president. Photograph: Thomas Peter/Reuters    What\u2019s the current \u201cdeal\u201d? China is the US\u2019s second-largest trading partner, after Canada. US exports are vital to China\u2019s economy and the US is similarly reliant on its cheap imports. However, the US has been alarmed by China\u2019s attitude to intellectual property and US competition. What new deal does Trump want? Trump wants a new trade deal with China. He has said the US was being \u201churt very badly by China with devaluation\u201d, though, in fact, China has been inflating its currency recently. Trump angered Beijing when he took a call from Taiwan\u2019s president; China regards the island as sovereign territory and US presidents have not spoken to its leaders in 40 years. How likely is he to get his way? Trump\u2019s Taiwan call seemed like a blunder but has been spun as a signal that US recognition of Taiwan could be a bargaining chip in a \u201cbetter\u201d trade deal. But Taiwan is non-negotiable for China and any such move is likely to meet with retaliation that will hurt the US economy and potentially lead to a global trade war \u2013 or worse. Iran      The US deal with Iran has been heavily criticised by the president-elect. Photograph: Christian Aslund/Getty Images/Lonely Planet Images    What\u2019s the current deal? America\u2019s historically tense relationship with Iran was somewhat eased last year when the US joined six other countries in signing a landmark nuclear deal. This exchanges a lifting of nuclear-related sanctions on Iran, which were crippling its economy, for a dismantling of its nuclear facilities. What does Trump want? Trump has heavily criticised the Iran deal and, at times, threatened to dismantle it; however, his aides said he would only seek to refine it or negotiate it. This would be extremely difficult and the president-elect has not been clear on what he would replace it with. How likely is he to get his way? The likelihood of tearing up the Iran deal is slim, as many of the deal\u2019s original critics oppose completely dismantling it, including Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of defence, James Mattis. Iran has mostly been in compliance with the deal, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which also makes renegotiation difficult. Defence     The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lighting II jet. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo    What\u2019s the deal? The US defence contractor Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 fighter jet programme, which comes with an estimated $400bn price tag, has been described as \u201cthe most expensive weapon system in history\u201d. What new deal does Trump want? A cheaper one. \u201cThe F-35 program and cost is out of control,\u201d Trump said on Twitter, a pronouncement that knocked Lockheed\u2019s share price \u2013 and those of other defence contractors involved in the project, including Britain\u2019s BAE. Trump went on to pledge: \u201cBillions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.\u201d How likely is he to get his way? Quite. While a president cannot cancel a programme after funds have been allocated, Trump has room for manoeuvre. Many in the US agree the programme is out of control. Even the US Senate armed services committee chairman, John McCain, who has voiced support for the fighter jet in the past, has suggested the president could buy fewer of the jets in the future. Russia      Trump has said he wants better relations with Russia. Photograph: Oleg Nikishin/Getty Images    What\u2019s the current deal? Relations have been poor over conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, while US sanctions have pushed Russia into recession. The CIA claims Russia hacked into Democratic National Committee emails to influence the election in Trump\u2019s favour. What new deal does Trump want? Trump has said he wants better relations with Russia and has complimented Vladimir Putin, including about his \u201cleadership\u201d after the Russian president was accused of killing journalists. He nominated Tillerson, who has with close ties to Russia, as secretary of state, and has rejected the CIA\u2019s election claims. How likely is he to get his way? Putin is open to a rapprochement with a Trump-led US. In an address earlier this month, he said he was \u201cready for cooperation with the new American administration\u201d. What this means for conflicts in Syria and Ukraine remains to be seen. Politically, this may help Trump in some regions (and hurt in others); economically, it means little. US goods and services trade with Russia is worth about $38bn; with China it tops $659bn."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/17/donald-trump-china-unpresidented-act-us-navy-drone", "publicationDate": "2016-12-18T01:43:02Z", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "Trump administration", "US foreign policy", "US national security", "US military", "China", "Asia Pacific", "US news", "World news", "US politics", "Republicans", "South China Sea"], "sentences": ["His message \u2013 itself without precedent given his status as a president-elect commenting on an international incident before assuming power \u2013 was likely to worsen fears of increased US-China tensions under his presidency that have grown over his rhetoric on trade and policy towards Taiwan.", "Trump took a congratulatory phone call from the Taiwanese president earlier this month, breaking with nearly 40 years of US foreign policy orthodoxy, and then used a Fox News interview to question US \u201cone China\u201d policy on Taiwan, a breakaway island state which is not recognised by Beijing.", "This goes to the core of how they see themselves and their reaction on this issue could end up being very significant.\u201d On Thursday, Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Guardian the seizure of the drone looked \u201clike signalling from the Chinese in response to Trump\u2019s Taiwan call\u201d."], "title": "Donald Trump accuses China of 'unpresidented' act over US navy drone", "article": "President-elect Donald Trump has risked further inflaming US relations with China, after he used Twitter on Saturday to accuse China of an \u201cunpresidented [sic] act\u201d in its seizing of an unmanned American submarine this week.

A Pentagon spokesman said it was being operated by civilian contractors when it was seized on Thursday in international waters, about 57 miles north-west of Subic Bay, near the Philippines, in the South China Sea. The unmanned vehicle was deployed by the USNS Bowditch, an oceanographic and surveillance ship. A diplomatic complaint was issued by the US after its seizure, and its return demanded. The area in which the submarine was taken is claimed by China virtually in its entirety. China has been building islands, and this week it was reported to have installed \u201csignificant\u201d weaponry on them \u2013 including anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems. On Saturday, the Chinese foreign ministry said that American \u201chyping up\u201d was not conducive to a smooth resolution of an incident that began when a Chinese naval vessel discovered a piece of \u201cunidentified equipment\u201d and checked it to prevent any navigational safety issues, before discovering it was a US drone.

Photograph: Twitter    Observers have suggested that both during the presidential campaign \u2013 in which Trump offered belligerent rhetoric against China over trade \u2013 and after his election victory, he has used outlandish statements on Twitter as a means of distraction when under pressure from the media and opponents.

The iota of doubt that remains comes from an unprecedented eruption of discontent from electors, the body of 538 people chosen by the two main political parties to cast the electoral college vote. Under the peculiarities of the American system, the president is not chosen directly by a \u201cone person-one vote\u201d policy: indeed, Clinton won the popular vote on 8 November by some 2.9m ballots.   Related: The electoral college: why it exists, how it works and can it stop Trump?    Instead, it is the indirect electoral college vote, parceled out by a complicated formula and awarded to the candidate who won each state, that is the final arbiter of who occupies the White House. This year, at least eight of the 538 have indicated that they intend to break ranks with modern tradition and vote against their party in a protest directed squarely against Trump. All but one of those rebels are Democratic, which is not coincidental. Many of these Democrats see the electoral college as the last-ditch hope of stopping Trump \u2013 the idea being that if their example can encourage their Republican fellow electors to follow suit and rally around a compromise alternative candidate, the Trump presidency can yet be abated. The chances of that are exceptionally slim. The only Republican rebel to come out so far is Christopher Suprun, an elector from Texas. On the Republican side, nobody knows the extent, if any, of a potential uprising by electors beyond him. A survey by Associated Press found little enthusiasm among Republican electors for joining the rebellion. Yet the Harvard law professor Larry Lessig said this week that at least 20 Republican electors were seriously considering defecting. No names of that elusive 20 have emerged and no one knows how many will actually carry through with the protest by voting for an alternative Republican to Trump. All that we do know is that 2016 will go down in the history books as a seismic year for the electoral college. Here, six of the so-called \u201cfaithless electors\u201d who intend to rebel on Monday explain in their own words what is driving their historic action. Polly Baca, 75, Colorado     Polly Baca. Photograph: Facebook    In June 1968, I was in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles when Robert Kennedy, who I was working for as a campaign staffer, was assassinated. Kennedy was my hero and I was devastated by his death. But the despair I had then doesn\u2019t even come close to how I\u2019m feeling now. Today I\u2019m afraid for my country. I\u2019m afraid that we will be propelled into another war. My fear of Donald Trump is that his intent is not to ensure that the US is solid and safe and a leader in the world, but to aggrandize himself and make money. I had the privilege when I was younger of going twice to the Soviet Union as a guest of the American council of young political leaders. I learned there that the main factors that distinguish a dictatorship are efforts to destroy freedom of assembly and freedom of speech and the press. Those are precisely the same freedoms that Trump has been attacking relentlessly. As electors, we have the responsibility to stop him. I would love to see 37 Republican electors vote for Hillary Clinton on Monday \u2013 after all, she did win the popular vote. But if we can\u2019t get that, then I am willing to support a viable Republican alternative. Christopher Suprun, 42, Texas Though Donald Trump won my state of Texas, I\u2019m intending to write in a different Republican candidate when I come to vote. I haven\u2019t decided yet who that will be.  I know that I am not alone. There are other Republican electors who are considering voting for a not-Trump candidate who have talked to me about it. I am very comfortable that I will not be the only Republican on Monday voting according to their conscience.     Christopher Suprun. Photograph: Evans Caglage/The Dallas Morning News    Donald Trump is a demagogue. He is not thinking about our national wellbeing or security. Rather he appears to be profiting from foreign connections that are forbidden under our constitution. Our founding fathers specifically created the electoral college to protect smaller states from the tyranny of the majority. Electors should have a deliberative role \u2013 otherwise, why not just use jelly beans or bricks to deliver the final decision? Since I announced my intention to vote according to my conscience, I have received about half a dozen death threats against me and my family. More happily, a person I\u2019ve known for years who traces his ancestry back to the American revolution told me he thinks his forebears would have been proud of what I\u2019m doing, which made me feel pretty good. Bret Chiafalo, 38, Washington state Stopping Donald Trump is an emergency. It\u2019s a moral imperative \u2013 we simply have to prevent a man like Trump from being elected to the presidency. There\u2019s thousands of reasons why I say that. He has shown himself repeatedly on Twitter, in his phone call to Taiwan that overturned decades of diplomacy, in his clear ability to hold a grudge about the smallest of slights, that he is incapable of controlling his feelings. Such hot-headedness can cause wars.     Bret Chiafalo. Photograph: Elaine Thompson/AP    I\u2019d also point to the way he seems to be influenced by foreign powers. The founding fathers specifically warned us about that when they framed the electoral college. Russia is only one such example of the conflicts of interest that stand between Trump\u2019s business holdings around the world and the country\u2019s interests. It is assumed that electors must just vote sheep-like for the party candidate who wins their state. But I believe in the rule of law. Between the constitution and Federalist 68 \u2013 Alexander Hamilton\u2019s treatise that sets out the purpose of the electoral college \u2013 it is clear that we have the duty to block anyone who is unfit for the presidency.  I stand to be fined up to $1,000 by the state of Washington. That\u2019s a lot of money. But a thousand bucks versus a moral imperative \u2013 no contest.  Levi Guerra, 19, Washington state When I signed up to be an elector in May it was at a time of great conflict within the Democratic party between Hillary Clinton supporters and Bernie Sanders supporters. But we all managed to come together around one promise: no Trump. That was the pledge I made when I joined the electoral college \u2013 that I would do everything I could to block Trump.      Levi Guerra. Photograph: Courtsey of Levi Guerra    This is the first time I\u2019ve been old enough to vote in a presidential election. I expect elected officials to keep their promises and I think it would be wrong not to hold myself to the same standard. So I\u2019m doing everything in my power to keep that pledge. That means casting my electoral college ballot not for Clinton, who won my state of Washington, but for a compromise Republican candidate who other Republican electors can rally around to stop Trump getting elected. This is not about the Democratic or Republican party; it is about unifying us all for the benefit of the country. For the longest time, the electoral college has been a mysterious thing for so many Americans. Since our action started, many more people have started to think about the system and debate how it could be used to protect what we hold dear. Vinz Koller, 53, California I\u2019ve been in DC this week and I went to look at the original Federalist Papers and in particular Federalist 68. There\u2019s something about seeing the actual documents, realizing how prescient the founding fathers were. They certainly knew about the threat of foreign influence, about how foreign powers seek \u201cto gain an improper ascendant in our councils\u201d.     Hillary Clinton and Vinz Koller. Photograph: Barbara Kinney/Hillary for America    I leapt when I read that. It\u2019s what we have right now: a candidate who during the campaign invited the Russians to spy on us and use cyberwarfare against our country. Donald Trump encouraged that to happen, and the evidence that we have suggests that\u2019s precisely what Russia did. It strikes me as remarkable that documents that are more than 200 years old could have anticipated something like that happening. The founding fathers also feared what they called \u201cthe little arts of popularity\u201d. I take that to mean populism and demagoguery. They were afraid of a snake oil salesman running for the highest office \u2013 and frankly, that\u2019s what we got. Monday will be a test of what the electoral college was created for. If ever there\u2019s a moment in which we should be exercising our power to act in the face of danger, it is this one.  Micheal Baca, 24, Colorado People have called me a \u201cfaithless\u201d elector. I want to push back on that: I\u2019m a conscientious elector or faithful elector. I believe I\u2019m being faithful to the constitution by being true to my conscience, rather than just being a rubber stamp. I believe Donald Trump to be a demagogue and that the majority of Americans would have a different Republican in the White House. That\u2019s not overturning the result of the election that the Republicans won, but it is standing up to a clear and present danger.     Micheal Baca. Photograph: Courtesy of Michael Baca    So I am putting my country above my party and coming together with Republican electors. The hope is that we can unite around a more responsible Republican to lead this country. When Bret Chiafalo and I came together over social media to form the Hamilton electors, some time around 3am on 9 November, we knew this would be a long shot. But since then the odds have moved considerably in our favor. We\u2019ve sparked a national debate. People are starting to understand that electors are individuals, not just numbers on the map.  Whoever is inaugurated as president on 20 January, I will fully support them and respect the office they hold. Even if that person is Donald Trump. I want our country to be the greatest. But at least I\u2019ll know that I did everything I could, through sheer will and a heck of a lot of help.

Ministers promised earlier this year to ban microbeads in personal care products such as toothpaste and face scrubs by the end of 2017, but stopped short of pledging to ban them in other products. Now, officials have called for more evidence on the environmental impact of other sources of microbeads, such as washing powder and householder cleaners. Campaigners said any ban should apply to all products washed down the drain. In a consultation published on Tuesday, the government said microbeads from personal care products account for less than 4.1% of all microplastics entering the ocean, so a ban solely on those would \u201chave only a small impact.\u201d    Related: Microplastics killing fish before they reach reproductive age, study finds    \u201cWe are therefore taking this opportunity to ask for evidence on the extent of the environmental impacts of microbeads found in other products, to inform future UK actions to protect the marine environment,\u201d officials wrote.

A coalition of environmental groups \u2013 the Environmental Investigation Agency, Fauna &amp; Flora International, Greenpeace UK and the Marine Conservation Society \u2013 welcomed the cosmetics ban but said it needed to be broader. \u201cIt must cover all microplastics as marine life doesn\u2019t distinguish between plastic from a face wash and plastic from a washing detergent, so the microbeads ban must cover all plastics in all household and industrial products that can go down our drains,\u201d the groups said in a statement.           How the microbead ban could help solve a massive problem    Microbeads have been shown to stunt fish growth and increase their mortality rates when ingested during their development. It is not yet clear whether they pose a threat to human health through the food chain, but the UK\u2019s chief medical officer is investigating that risk. More than 378,000 people have signed a petition calling for a ban on microbeads in products, which many retailers and companies are already on the verge of phasing out. Nearly three quarters of major cosmetic companies will have ceased to include them in cosmetic products by 2017, well ahead of the ban at the year\u2019s end. Andrea Leadsom, the environment secretary, said microbeads were \u201cincredibly damaging to our sea life\u201d and urged shoppers to eschew products containing microbeads today, ahead of the ban. \u201cWhether you\u2019re shopping for a loved one, or picking up a bargain in the sales, I urge shoppers to check any rinse-off cosmetics they are buying are microbead free,\u201d she said.

As highly skilled people, those who stay also make an invaluable contribution to our economy, paying taxes which support public spending. Of course students should be removed from the net migration target rather than targeted in this way, but government must also show it actually values the contribution those from abroad make rather than viewing them as a political problem.

We are sad that Amber Rudd thinks this country would be a better place if half of these people (who incidentally pay far higher fees than native students) could be kept away by erecting quotas, persuading them that they would be better off studying at home, or inventing questionnaires with trick questions.

Certainly, the more closely we approximate to North Korea, the more in control we shall feel.Joyce and George SchlesingerDurham \u2022 Courses offering opportunities to UK students would not run without the presence of international students, especially at postgraduate level. The current policy reflects a totally uncoordinated approach on the part of government. Why spend millions on marketing UK education overseas at the same time as attempting to drive down the number of student visas? The solution to reduce overall immigration figures is so simple: remove students from the migration statistics and place them in a separate classification in the same way that many of our competitors do. Net migration figures would be reduced at a stroke at the same\u00a0time as preserving a major contributor to the UK\u2019s economy.David CroninStockport, Cheshire \u2022 What the government should be doing is to evaluate Britain\u2019s economic strengths in order to provide a Brexit parachute, and three obvious areas are education, research and the arts. In 2008-09, tuition fee income to the UK from foreign students was worth over \u00a34bn, and 18% of the \u00a326.4bn spent on research and development in the UK in 2010 came from overseas (\u00a34.8bn). The UK\u2019s creative industries are now worth \u00a384.1bn per year to the UK economy, or almost \u00a310m per hour. Why therefore limit the number of foreign students who can come to the UK and cut back on arts education in schools and colleges? We need a quick and entirely objective reappraisal of government policy in these areas, for purely economic reasons if nothing else.Dr Richard TurnerHarrogate, North Yorkshire \u2022 Surely the typical overseas student comes to the UK to study for three or four years and then goes home again.

That is the view of Peter Navarro, the man chosen by Donald Trump to lead a new presidential office for US trade and industrial policy, a move likely to add to Beijing\u2019s anxieties over the billionaire\u2019s plans for US-China relations.

Peter Navarro Photograph: Courtesy of Peter Navarro    But Beijing is unlikely to second such emotions. Navarro has penned a number of vociferously anti-China tomes including Death by China and Crouching Tiger: What China\u2019s Militarism Means for the World.  In The Coming China Wars \u2013 a 2006 book that Trump has called one of his favourite on China \u2013 Navarro portrays the Asian country as a nightmarish realm where \u201cthe raw stench of a gut-wrenching, sweat-stained fear\u201d hangs in the air and myopic, venal and incompetent Communist party officials rule the roost.

In a 2012 Netflix documentary based on Death by China, which Trump has described as \u201cright on\u201d, Navarro blames Beijing for the loss of 57,000 American factories and 25m jobs. \u201cThe repressive communist government [is] now victimising both American and Chinese citizens alike,\u201d the film claims.  \u201cHelp defend America and protect your family: don\u2019t buy made in China,\u201d Navarro tells viewers in an introduction to the 80-minute polemic, which is narrated by Martin Sheen.  Navarro, who has also dubbed China a \u201cglobal pollution factory\u201d and \u201cdisease incubator\u201d, made no secret of his distaste for its rulers during Trump\u2019s election campaign.     An image from Peter Navarro\u2019s 2012 documentary Death by China Photograph: Netflix    Speaking to the Guardian in July at a resort near his home in Laguna Beach the academic railed against how China\u2019s \u201cbrutal, authoritarian communist government\u201d had decimated the US economy.  He painted China as a ravenous bully and said he agreed with Trump\u2019s claim that Beijing was guilty of \u201craping our country\u201d over trade.  \u201cIt\u2019s an apt description of the damage and carnage that China\u2019s trade policies have wrought on the American economic heartland. What\u2019s happening is rapacious,\u201d Navarro said. Speaking shortly before Navarro\u2019s appointment was confirmed, Andrew Nathan, a China expert at Columbia University, said Trump\u2019s plans for relations with Beijing remained an enigma despite the presence of several prominent China hawks in his camp.  \u201cTrump has shown two sides to his personality in dealing with everybody. One is: \u2018Let\u2019s make a deal, we are deal-makers.\u2019 And the other one is: \u2018You hurt my feelings and I\u2019m going to bomb the shit out of you because I never lose \u2013 I always win\u2019,\u201d said the political scientist. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he is setting up China for a deal. In fact, I don\u2019t know if he is that deliberate or whether his mood just changes from time-to-time depending on how the other side treats him.\u201d Nathan, the author of a book on foreign policy called China\u2019s Search For Security, said he believed Beijing would still be banking on its ability to win over the tycoon.  \u201cI think predominantly they understand Trump as a businessman \u2013 and that for them is a glimmer of hope,\u201d he said. Christopher Balding, a Peking University finance professor, said that for all Navarro\u2019s \u201calarmist\u201d and \u201cinflammatory\u201d musings on China, he was unlikely to be able to follow through on his most radical beliefs once in government.

It was August 2008. Christina Aguilera had serenaded hundreds of guests, each of whom had been given an iPod in their doggy bag after feasting on cake dusted with flakes of gold. \u201cI was standing there in the valet line waiting for my beat-up Mitsubishi to arrive in a sea of Bentleys, a sea of excess,\u201d she recalls. Chang had been invited as a journalist working for a luxury magazine. On the drive home she turned to her friend and said: \u201c\u2018Everything\u2019s going to collapse.\u2019 I remember thinking there\u2019s another story here that I really wanted to tell \u2013 a story set at a point when it was all going to change. I wanted to write about fracture, but I also wanted to write a different type of immigrant story: one that I hadn\u2019t seen before.\u201d A fortnight later, Lehman Brothers filed the biggest bankruptcy petition in US history, forcing the US to confront its descent into recession. In The Wangs Vs the World, self-made millionaire Charles Wang has just suffered his own Lehmans moment, after the banks foreclosed on his cosmetics business. The first few pages of the novel were the first that Chang wrote, starting with three outraged paragraphs:  Charles Wang was mad at America. Actually, Charles Wang was mad at history. If the death-bent Japanese had never invaded China, if a million \u2013 a billion \u2013 misguided students and serfs had never idolised a balding academic who parroted Russian madmen and couldn\u2019t pay for his promises, then Charles wouldn\u2019t be standing here staring out the window of his beloved Bel-Air home, holding an aspirin in his hand, waiting for those calculating assholes from the bank \u2013 the bank that had once gotten down on its Italianate-marble knees and kissed his ass \u2013 to come over and repossess his life.  Packing his family into a 30-year-old station wagon, borrowed back from the woman who used to be his nanny, he sets off on a riotous 3,500-mile road trip from Los Angeles to hole up with his eldest daughter in New York, en route to fulfilling his dream of reclaiming his ancestral lands in China. With him in the car are his two younger children, wannabe standup Andrew and private-school brat Grace, and his second wife, Barbra \u2013 self-named after Barbra Streisand, to the cruel derision of her stepchildren.   Related: The Wangs Vs the World by Jade Chang review \u2013 a richly entertaining debut    The Wangs are both an embodiment of America and at at odds with it. On a literal level, their riches-to-rags story takes them in the opposite direction to most classic road-trip fiction, from west to east. The illusions of belonging that were shored up by extreme wealth are dashed when they take to the highway. \u201cSo, where are you from?\u201d asks a paramedic after their car spins off the road. \u201cNo, but where are you from from?\u201d he repeats, when a dazed Grace tries to insist that she\u2019s from LA. Chang, who lives and until recently worked as a journalist in Los Angeles, describes herself as \u201c100% Chinese, 100% American and 100% Asian, all at the same time\u201d. Though the novel is not autobiographical, the Wangs\u2019 history mirrors that of her own family, and one of the ways in which this is not the typical immigrant yarn is that neither family arrived impoverished in search of a better life.  She was born in 1976 in Ohio, the older of two daughters to Chinese parents who met at graduate school in the US. Both sides of the family had owned land in China, which they had lost under communism. \u201cThey had to flee the country and, along with many other people, fled with the nationalist army to Taiwan \u2013 not literally, but as part of the pretty widespread diaspora,\u201d she explains, \u201cThey grew up in a Taiwan that they basically colonised: only Mandarin was allowed to be spoken. A lot of native Taiwanese worked as cooks and nannies.\u201d It\u2019s a history that gave her an understanding of Charles Wang\u2019s yearning for the land that he feels is rightfully his, and an ear for his voice: \u201crageful, funny, ridiculous, kind of dumb in some ways but smart in others. Once I had Charles\u2019s voice I had the world and the family.\u201d Chang grew up speaking Mandarin at home and has peppered the dialogue with Chinese sentences, written in the English alphabet. \u201cI wanted people to have a sense of what it felt like to be in the car with the family and the way they would be speaking. I wanted readers to be able to sound out the words. I didn\u2019t actually translate any of it but it\u2019s all there in the context.\u201d She\u2019s intrigued that some readers have reported finding the Chinese dialogue \u201cdestabilising\u201d, pointing out that there are several different languages in the book, which readers may or may not understand. Charles\u2019s oldest daughter, Saina, is an artist provocateur who has suffered her own downfall after playing one stunt too many. \u201cIf you\u2019re really familiar with the art world you will have a different understanding of the story, just as you will if you\u2019re familiar with the fashion world or with finance. All the characters have to learn to understand each other\u2019s worlds and trust each other\u2019s interpretations of them.\u201d Both Saina and Andrew suffer for being unable to \u201cread\u201d the unwritten rules on racial representation and good taste. In one of the novel\u2019s most excruciating scenes, Andrew tanks at an open-mic comedy session in Austin, Texas. \u201cYou know what white people really, really, really love?\u201d he burbles. \u201cWhen Asian comedians make fun of their parents. Yep, because you guys just want an excuse to laugh at Asian actors. Black people, no offence, but in this joke you basically count as white people. Admit it, as soon as I came up, you thought to yourselves, \u2018oh man, I hope he says lots of R words, just tons of them.\u2019\u201d To understand what she was putting her character through, Chang enrolled on an improvisation course. The first three classes left her wondering if she was \u201cthis undiscovered comic genius \u2013 pitching situations is easy for me\u201d. But once it came to embodying the situations she had pitched, she fell flat on her face. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be an Italian shopkeeper who\u2019s hobbled by holding a giant Parma ham and think about what to say at the same time.\u201d Though there is a lot of embarrassment in a novel that was described as \u201crichly entertaining\u201d in the Guardian, it always falls short of humiliation. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in putting something out in the world that leaves people feeling diminished in any way,\u201d she says. \u201cI like satire, but I\u2019m not interested in writing it because it\u2019s important to me to write something with a generosity of spirit and I don\u2019t think satire has that generosity. Like the protagonist of Paul Beatty\u2019s The Sellout, the Wangs come from Los Angeles. Though not as fast and furious as Beatty\u2019s Booker winner, the novel shares something of The Sellout\u2019s stroppy refusal to euphemise its characters\u2019 experience. \u201cI like to describe it as The Sellout meets Little Miss Sunshine, because I think that\u2019s funny but it\u2019s also spiritually accurate,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to see it as The Corrections meets Crazy Rich Asians, but I think in intention and emotion that\u2019s not really it.\u201d For all the eccentricity of their predicament \u2013 and a diversity of viewpoint that extends to some passages being narrated by a car \u2013 the Wangs carry with them a weight of communal history, which is pointed out from time to time with Dickensian omniscience:  All across the country, one by one, foreclosed home by shuttered business, in cold bedrooms and empty boardrooms and cars turned into homes, people had the same thoughts. I couldn\u2019t rescue myself. I will never win. My failure will always be epic and my sorrow will always be great.  This is precisely the hardship and the social solipsism that propelled the UK out of Europe and Donald Trump into the White House. It\u2019s one reason why The Wangs Vs the World is unlikely to date any time soon.  The Wangs Vs the World is published by Penguin, priced \u00a314.99.

The US does not officially host Taiwanese leaders. Taiwan has been self-governing and de facto independent since the end of China\u2019s civil war. Beijing regards it as a renegade province. Alex Huang, spokesman for Taiwan\u2019s presidential office, denied that the planning or disclosure of the transit stops were being delayed due to pressure from China. \u201cThere is no problem of that kind,\u201d Huang said. But China this week reiterated its strong objection to Tsai and her 90-strong government delegation touching down on US soil, claiming that allowing her to do so would \u201csend wrong signals to Taiwan independence forces\u201d.

Related: China should plan to take Taiwan by force after Trump call, state media says    Any meeting between Tsai and Trump or his advisers would be politically explosive, coming so close to Trump\u2019s inauguration on 20 January. It would probably exacerbate tensions caused by the president-elect\u2019s blunt criticisms of Chinese trade policy, military activity in the South China Sea, and recent seizure of a US underwater research drone. China initially accused Tsai of playing a trick by inducing Trump to take her congratulatory phone call after his November election victory. But Beijing\u2019s tone has since grown more threatening, with officials vowing to defend China\u2019s \u201ccore interest\u201d of reunification with Taiwan. Recent days have seen stepped-up Chinese military activity in international airspace around Taiwan. China maintains thousands of missiles across the Taiwan Strait. State media have published calls for China to be ready to achieve reunification by force if necessary. Tensions have also been stoked by this week\u2019s decision by the indebted west African country, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, to break off ties with Taiwan and align itself with China. Taiwanese MPs said China was using \u201cdollar diplomacy\u201d to further isolate the island, an accusation China angrily rejected on Thursday. Beijing has gradually been chipping away at Taiwan\u2019s overseas relationships. It consistently opposes Taiwanese membership of international forums. After losing S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Taiwan has formal diplomatic relations with 20 countries and the Holy See remaining, mostly small countries that look to it for development aid. Tsai appealed for unity this week at a closed-doors meeting of her ruling DPP. \u201cAt a time of change, national solidarity across party lines is increasingly needed to fight against foreign forces,\u201d a party spokesman, Yang Chia-liang, quoted Tsai as saying. \u201cChina has never stopped suppressing Taiwan\u2019s international participation and diplomatic efforts.\u201d  In a People\u2019s Daily interview, Wang Yi, China\u2019s foreign minister, said the stakes were high. \u201cGoing forward, China-US relations will face new complexities and uncertain factors ...

The China Daily described him as the \u201cmastermind\u201d behind Trump\u2019s repeated campaign trail attacks on Beijing.  Navarro has blamed China\u2019s admittance into the World Trade Organisation in 2001 for decimating the US economy and destroying millions of jobs and has urged American consumers to boycott Chinese goods to avoid bankrolling what he describes as Beijing\u2019s increasing militarism. Orville Schell, the head of the centre on US-China relations at New York\u2019s Asia Society, said Navarro\u2019s appointment was a \u201crisky bargain\u201d.  \u201cThe positive side is that it\u2019s a real signal that things are out of balance \u2013 which I think everybody agrees they are - in terms of trade and investment [between the US and China].\u201d  \u201cThe bad side of it is that China reacts often in a very neuralgic way to insults or things that they might take as an insult. And I can imagine they might view Navarro as something of a provocation.\u201d  Schell said Navarro\u2019s appointment and a succession of controversial interventions from Trump on issues including Taiwan and the South China Sea would have left Beijing off-balance. \u201cBut of course when they get off-balance sometimes they get more pugnacious,\u201d he said.

Carr is the New York-based director of the Elevator Historical Society, which, until it closed down last summer, claimed to be the world\u2019s only lift museum. \u201cThere are many hundreds of thousands more elevators now than there were 15 years ago. In China, the growth of lifts has been massive. Otis and Schindler are in a life and death struggle to get the best lift out [on the market].\u201d  So the vertical transportation trade and R&amp;D war is on. Otis\u2019s Gen2 Life model aims to bring the \u201csmart lift\u201d to the mass market, with an app that calls the lift from your smartphone, plus \u201crevolutionary flat-belt technology\u201d said to allow the working guts of the lift to be more compact and energy efficient. Meanwhile, its arch rival Schindler has introduced a solar panel lift, and ThyssenKrupp is launching a cable-less lift powered by magnet-based technology. There are also growing numbers of double-decker lifts; and, of course, an ongoing race to be the fastest \u2013 currently riding high is the Taipei 101 building in Taiwan, where the lift travels at 37.7mph.     Taipei 101 has the world\u2019s fastest lift. Photograph: Alamy    Soon enough, lifts will move horizontally as well as vertically within buildings. They will do without buttons and become part of the internet of things, gathering data about components and users, anticipating your floor stop, and monitoring your \u201cdwell time\u201d.  This may cause panic among those of us that don\u2019t particularly like lifts \u2013 but if you don\u2019t want cities to sprawl, Carr says, we\u2019ll just have to accept them. \u201cIf every building stopped at the fifth floor \u2013 which is the maximum people want to walk \u2013 then New York would stretch to Ohio and London halfway to Manchester.\u201d Shaping the urban realm  In the 150 years or so of their commercial existence, lifts have shaped the urban realm. In Lifted: A Cultural History of the Elevator, author Andreas Bernard notes how the lift has not only changed the appearance of cities, but their inner life: moving luxury living from the ground to the once-cheaper top (in Haussmann\u2019s Paris, the least desirable garrets were always the highest); even possessing a certain sky-bound romanticism (the Empire State Building\u2019s 86th floor viewing area has long been a marriage proposal destination).    We need to be directed to stairs as lifts have been prioritised for too long  Paul Nuki     Lifts even trump nature. At Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa, currently the world\u2019s highest building, you can see two sunsets in a day by viewing it on the ground floor, then taking the lift to the top.  Still, lifts carry a certain baggage of alienation. Urbanist guru Jane Jacobs wasn\u2019t a fan, thinking that the creation of \u201celevator apartments\u201d hollowed out street life. And they can be incubators of anxiety: those queasy mirrors, the blank faces of fellow, forward-facing passengers \u2013 not to mention the ever-present fear of getting stuck, or plummeting to the floor. So lift designers are trying to humanise their cabs and siphon off those underlying worries. Carr, who remains a big fan of large early lifts (\u201cI particularly love \u2018birdcage\u2019 elevators with velvet seats\u201d) says much effort is being put in \u201cto make elevators prettier and less claustrophobic\u201d. For its part, Otis is promising to transform the lift into what it calls a \u201cfashionable and functional room\u201d. At the same time, proponents of active health design suggest we might be too reliant on lifts, and there are growing moves to steer us away from them.     \u2018Statement stairs\u2019: Switch House at the Tate Modern. Photograph: View Pictures/Rex/Shutterstock    In the US, the Center for Active Design encourages stair use \u2013 as does the NHS \u2013 and the health injunctions for \u201cincidental activity\u201d are growing, with stair climbing an obvious first step. A social enterprise, StepJockey (seed-funded by the UK Department of Health) aims to nudge behavioural change by way of branded signage. \u201cWe need to be directed to stairs as lifts have been prioritised for too long,\u201d says its director Paul Nuki.  Most walkers can tolerate five or six floors, and most buildings go up to 10 floors \u2013 still manageable for many. But even in taller buildings you can cut down on lift use. \u201cOften companies take four floors in bigger buildings; we believe they should encourage staff to walk between them, to the gym, the canteen,\u201d says Nuki, who thinks that lifts are a 20th-century idea, defined by the anachronistic notion that true luxury is being inactive. It is also argued that lifts are less efficient. A 2010 IBM Smart Cities paper found that US office workers in 16 cities over one year spent a net 33 years waiting for lifts, with clear effects on productivity. And rather than bring people together, lifts can be antisocial: when US biotech firm Sigma-Aldrich installed a central staircase, it raised employee interaction.

Tate Modern Switch House architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron\u2019s wide and graceful stairs are specifically designed to promote interaction. Apple has patented the design of its in-store \u2013 and on-brand \u2013 glass stairs, while Paul Cocksedge Studio\u2019s planted \u201cliving staircase\u201d for the Ampersand office building in Soho is designed to bring people together. But as lift consultant John Newbold of SVM Associates says: \u201cStairs are stylish but space-hungry, so they tend to be emphasised by more progressive developers rather than volume developers.\u201d Given they\u2019re inevitable, lift companies are working to make their products more attractive \u2013 and more active. \u201cAs cities became more impersonal,\u201d says Rotagnon, \u201cwe now have to make lifts feel more personal.\u201d As well as smart technology, this means promoting better interior design so that, as Newbold puts it: \u201clifts become more like a cosy room, with inviting surfaces and media.\u201d The next thing, perhaps, is to bring back a bit of that old glamour. Joe Kilgallon, sales director at Otis, says he is increasingly fielding calls from private buyers and boutiques asking for \u201cZen\u201d all-white lifts, and revivals of old iron concertina lifts. Some of us will always try and walk \u2013 and good for us. But lift historian Carr is firmly in the other camp: \u201cI say reserve all that energy for the fun stuff,\u201d he growls.

Terrifying, isn\u2019t it?\u2019", "article": "Raymond Briggs would have good grounds for feeling every bit as grouchy as he likes to appear. Late last year, his partner of 40 years died of Parkinson\u2019s disease; she had been ill for years, many more than he had realised. \u201cYou look back and think: \u2018God, that was odd, the things Liz did.\u2019 I came home one day years ago and saw this lovely carpet out on the grass. Extraordinary. Why throw it away? I couldn\u2019t understand it. I mean, God almighty, it was very exasperating. But at the time, we didn\u2019t know she was ill. It was this creeping, awful disease thing.\u201d He inhales briskly. \u201cNever mind. Bit of a bugger, but there we are, such is life. Never mind.\u201d This is the second time the illustrator has been widowed. In 1963 he married a painter he met at art school. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a madly keen marrying type or burning with love or anything. I mean, I loved her, but I don\u2019t particularly approve of marriage as such. Or disapprove. It just seems pointless to tie up your emotional relationship with the law. Always seems awful to me.\u201d But she had schizophrenia, \u201cand we got married mainly because I thought it would help her mental state \u2013 give her a feeling of stability\u201d. So although Briggs was \u201cthe normal sort of young arty type\u201d, he saw little of the 1960s.   Related: Ethel &amp; Ernest review \u2013 moving adaptation of Raymond Briggs's graphic novel    \u201cI had a house and a mortgage and all that, and didn\u2019t feel part of the 60s movement thing at all. I remember saying to friends, \u2018I\u2019m sick to death of hearing about these fucking Beatles. I\u2019m not the least bit interested\u2019.\u201d His wife died in 1973, of \u201cschizophrenia combined with leukaemia\u201d. Under his breath, he mutters, \u201cGod, that was a jolly one-man-band.\u201d As Briggs talks, he shuffles around his cluttered cottage making coffee. Papers are stacked all over the place; he is currently making his will. \u201cTerrible bloody business. They say: \u2018Who is your next of kin?\u2019 Well, I don\u2019t have a next of kin. I asked [Liz\u2019s daughter] Claire, \u2018Would you mind being my next of kin?\u2019 But she\u2019s not my daughter, nor even a stepdaughter.\u201d Now touching 50, Claire and her brother were at primary school when Briggs and their mother became a couple, but he never felt paternal towards them. \u201cNo, I kept out of the paternal role. I made it a rule not to buy them anything for Christmas that cost more than a fiver, because I didn\u2019t want to be saying, \u2018Oh, look at me, I\u2019m better-off than your father.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to intrude in that way.\u201d He pauses glumly. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a funny old business, all this stuff. People idealise family life, don\u2019t they? It\u2019s not necessarily all that easy.\u201d For that matter, \u201cI\u2019ve never been particularly interested in children at all, as such. Don\u2019t particularly dislike them. But I\u2019m not,\u201d and his tone turns crisply disdainful, \u201ca \u2018child lover\u2019.\u201d     The 1982 film of Raymond Briggs\u2019 story The Snowman. Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock    The bestselling children\u2019s author was appalled to be considered a potential children\u2019s laureate some years ago. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the point of that. It sounded awful. You go all over the country. Imagine it! The hotels and bed-and-breakfasts and taxis and trains, and really you just think: for God\u2019s sake, what for? I suppose if you like that kind of public appearance, it\u2019s alright, but I\u2019d hate it.\u201d He isn\u2019t keen on lifetime achievement awards, either. \u201cI\u2019ve had one or two of those, and it\u2019s a rather funny title, because come on, my lifetime hasn\u2019t ended yet. But if you say you\u2019ve got a lifetime achievement award, it\u2019s like \u2013 well come on, get dead, man!\u201d And he famously, of course, \u201chates Christmas\u201d. I\u2019m not convinced Briggs is anything like the miserabilist he affects to be. For one thing, he follows every grumpy pronouncement with a light little laugh, as if in on his own joke. For another, he volunteers a touchingly tender memory of meeting me on holiday in Scotland more than 30 years ago. I was only a child, so I don\u2019t think he can find kids an unmitigated bore. Tentatively solicitous, he offers up a plate of chocolate brownies with a gentle air of inexpert hospitality, and his bah-humbug misanthropy is difficult to square with his kitchen walls, which are plastered with handmade cards and children\u2019s drawings. In a child\u2019s handwriting, one card reads: \u201cRaymond, you are really funny, lots of love, Matilda.\u201d Another shows a child\u2019s drawing of him. \u201cHideous caricature, you know. Doesn\u2019t look anything like me at all.\u201d But in spite of himself, he is grinning fondly, and points out a photo of a girl holding a copy of his book The Bear, which features a character called Tilly. \u201cThis little girl fell in love with Tilly and the bear, so she made her parents call her Tilly, and was so insistent that in the end they changed her name legally. Best compliment I ever had.\u201d He allows a bashful chuckle, plainly delighted. All over the rest of the wall are Christmas cards from the year before last. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be bothered to take them down,\u201d is the mumbled and rather unconvincing explanation. On another wall are posters of his two classic Christmas works, Father Christmas and The Snowman, making me wonder if he really does hate Christmas. \u201cOh, I do,\u201d he insists, but the reason he offers is not one that would belong to an actual misanthrope. \u201cIt\u2019s the anxiety. Have I spent enough, too much, how do I get it there, did I give her this before, has she already got this?\u201d To me, he sounds like someone who cares very much about making others happy, but has never quite been sure how to get it right, and so learned long ago to disguise social awkwardness as gruff impatience. An anecdote he tells about receiving a second invitation to appear on Desert Island Discs only confirms my hunch that his big fear is not public acclaim, but making a public faux pas. \u201cI was so relieved when towards the end of the second time the presenter said: \u2018We\u2019ve had you on before.\u2019 I thought: \u2018Oh, thank God, I didn\u2019t think you knew, yes you have.\u2019\u201d What he cannot conceal is his delight at the reception his latest film has received. \u201cI\u2019ve been to three or four screenings, and the audience has applauded at the end every time. Amazing! Amazing.\u201d Peering at me, he enquires casually: \u201cThey don\u2019t applaud at the end of a film in the cinema very often these days, do they?\u201d Happy to confirm they do not, I\u2019m nonetheless not remotely surprised to hear that they did for Ethel &amp; Ernest. The film is an adaptation of his 1998 book of the same name, and tells the simple story of his parents\u2019 unremarkable lives. Briggs\u2019 father was a milkman, who spotted a pretty housemaid shaking a duster from the window of a grand Belgravia house one day in 1928; he knocked at the back door, they courted briefly, got married, bought a house in Wimbledon, and doted on their only son, Raymond. Ernest was an irrepressibly happy-go-lucky working-class lad, Ethel a little less worldly but more aspirational. They remained happily married right up until their deaths in 1971, Ethel from dementia, and Ernest just months later from cancer.         Ethel &amp; Ernest trailer on YouTube    The film will be screened on Wednesday 28 December on BBC1, and on paper sounds so slight that I was quite unprepared for its impact \u2013 poignant and subtle, yet powerful enough to haunt me for weeks afterwards. Through Ethel and Ernest\u2019s ordinary, uneducated, innocent eyes we see the 20th century unfold, from the Great Depression and the rise of Hitler to the second world war and the welfare state; new-fangled mysteries such as television and telephones to the marvel of a family motor car, and the unfathomable sensations of the 60s \u2013 all the short-skirted women and long-haired men. Voiced by Jim Broadbent and Brenda Blethyn, Mr and Mrs Briggs are evoked so perfectly that their son spent most of the recording sessions in tears. \u201cIt was as if my parents were right there in the room. Uncanny. I don\u2019t know how they did it so well.\u201d I\u2019m equally at a loss to explain why I was moved to tears by a historiographically mundane recap of events we all know inside out. I had been floored once before by a Briggs film, but anyone could see why When the Wind Blows, his film about nuclear war, would have traumatised a teenager in 1986. It\u2019s been years since that chilling dread of global Armageddon left me, so I ask Briggs why he thinks Ethel &amp; Ernest feels so ominously resonant now. \u201cAh, because now that dread\u2019s coming back.\u201d He reels off a few current trigger points \u2013 China and Taiwan, eastern Ukraine, Russian warships cruising the English channel \u2013 \u201cand you think, my God, it could all be seen as utterly trivial \u2013 or it could be seen as something immensely serious. You just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, with a lunatic like Trump. And when we left that Europe thing, that Brexit nonsense, I was just so horrified. Crazy. When Nato and the UN were created, we thought it meant there could never be another world war. Well, there bloody well could be. Terrifying, isn\u2019t it? Can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Had Briggs made a film about his own life (\u201cGood God, no!\u201d), I wonder which world events we would have seen through his eyes? \u201cOh, blimey. That\u2019s a big question.\u201d He pauses to think. \u201cWell, the worst thing was the Cuban missile crisis, wasn\u2019t it? I remember feeling actual physical fear while that was going on. I remember looking out of the window of my bedsit in Wimbledon, and thinking: my God, by Monday all this I\u2019m looking at could be a smoking ruin.\u201d He isn\u2019t sure that he would still call himself a pacifist \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know, quite. Depends on the circumstances\u201d \u2013 but is definitely no longer \u201csolidly Labour. I used to be solid all the way through. But now I wouldn\u2019t know who to vote for. I certainly wouldn\u2019t vote Labour any more.\u201d He despairs of his once-loved party under Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cThe whole thing\u2019s just rubbish, isn\u2019t it? Falling apart.\u201d     When the Wind Blows, Briggs\u2019s nuclear war film from 1986. Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive    No matter how politically bleak the world\u2019s prospects, I had assumed Briggs could always console himself with his wealth, but when I say so, he looks astounded. \u201cNo, no, oh no. I\u2019m not rich.\u201d But The Snowman alone has sold more than 8m copies! \u201cHas it? Oh, I expect the publishers just say that.\u201d I\u2019m fairly sure book sales are rigorously audited. \u201cOh. Really?\u201d He looks genuinely surprised, but still insists he isn\u2019t rich. \u201cI don\u2019t take any interest in it,\u201d he adds. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s enough to pay the bills, I couldn\u2019t tell you how much I earn.\u201d He hasn\u2019t bought a house since the 70s, drives a second-hand Honda Jazz, and likes to shop in charity stores, so unless he has the world\u2019s worst literary agent, I would guess he\u2019s a lot richer than he either needs or cares to know.   Related: How The Snowman melted David Bowie\u2019s heart    I\u2019m far from the first to notice Briggs\u2019 temperamental resemblance to his crotchety fictional Father Christmas. But for all of his faux gloom, by the time I leave, only two of his grievances ring wholly true. He says he hates being old because \u201ceverything hurts\u201d, he\u2019s \u201cTATT \u2013 tired all the time\u201d, and random words keep eluding him. I believe him because they are written out in black marker pen as an aide memoire on his kitchen wall: probate, secular, prostate, migraine, narcissistic, sociopath, water chestnuts, merlot, post-script, Jim Broadbent, Brenda Blethyn, Katie Price \u2013 Jordan, ciabatta, diabetes, ragwort, Velcro and many more. The list would keep a Through the Keyhole audience guessing for ever, but Briggs has had quite enough by now of TV camera crews \u201cpoking around and moving bits of furniture. You don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re pinching things at the same time!\u201d Nor do I doubt the sincerity of his indignation about the Guardian\u2019s review of Ethel &amp; Ernest. \u201cIt said the film mentions my wife\u2019s schizophrenia, but that it\u2019s barely touched on. Well, what do you fucking expect? You can\u2019t just embark upon schizophrenia when you\u2019re writing about something else! It\u2019s a huge subject. If you knew anything about it, you\u2019d know you\u2019d need half a dozen books to write about it.\u201d As for the rest of it, my guess is that however much Briggs, like his fictional Father Christmas, loves to grumble, he likes making us happy even more. \u2022Ethel &amp; Ernest is on BBC1 at 7.30pm on Wednesday 28 December "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/24/good-news-2016-barbie-makeover-obamas-dancing-giant-rabbit", "publicationDate": "2016-12-24T09:00:41Z", "tags": ["Life and style", "Toys", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Barack Obama", "US news", "Michelle Obama", "The Archers", "Radio", "Domestic violence", "Society", "Teenage pregnancy", "Young people", "Pets"], "sentences": ["Leah Harper Taiwan votes for Tsai Ing-wen     A supporter holds a picture of Tsai Ing-wen.", "Photograph: Ulet Ifansasti/Getty Images    In a year that saw America pass on the chance to elect its first female president, there was better news from Taiwan: Tsai Ing-wen rose to power as one of the rare self-made female Asian leaders to have succeeded through hard work rather than family connections.", "In January, she was elected Taiwan\u2019s first female president, becoming the most powerful woman in the Chinese-speaking world.", "Taiwan, an island of 23 million people about 100 miles off the Chinese coast, has its own government, currency and military, but is viewed by China as a renegade province.", "It has, however, seen China retaliate by freezing diplomatic ties and allegedly restricting tourism to squeeze Taiwan\u2019s struggling economy.", "\u201cWe want to make Taiwan an Asian tiger once again,\u201d she wrote in the Economist in November.", "\u201cMy plan for 2017 is for Taiwan to renew its role as a pioneer.\u201d Nicola Smith Puddlewatch makes a splash           #Drummondpuddlewatch: the Periscope sensation that\u2019s making a splash    The first week of 2016 seems like an entirely different place."], "title": "2016's best bits: January to March", "article": "Barbie gets a makeover Barbara Millicent Roberts has a distinctive look. The doll, better known as Barbie, was in 1959 either blond or brunette, before ditching her dark locks for a long, impossibly sleek golden mane. But even in the early days, Barbie was notable for her lithe limbs, large-yet-pert breasts and, of course, teeny-tiny waist. Facially, her evolution has been almost constant: 1969\u2019s eyeliner flicks and pixie nose meant Barbie looked like Bewitched\u2019s Samantha. By the late 70s, she was bearing bright white teeth and in the late 80s/early 90s her already big pupils almost doubled in size; who knows why. Figure-wise, however, little has changed. In 1998, Mattel gave its latest doll, Really Rad Barbie, slimmer hips, a wider waistline and smaller bust, so Barbie would \u201chave more of a teenage physique\u201d. And in 2000 she acquired a tummy button. Progress, it\u2019s fair to say, has been slow. But there is hope: in 2016, Mattel acknowledged its \u201cresponsibility to girls and parents to reflect a broader view of beauty\u201d and gave Barbie a full-on reinvention. Jawlines were softened, thighs thickened, skin tones lightened and darkened. The Fashionistas range included three new body shapes (tall, curvy, petite), seven skin tones, 22 eye colours, 24 hairstyles and 14 \u201cface sculpts\u201d. It\u2019s easy to be cynical \u2013 diversity is good for business \u2013 and it may be some time before children choose to play with anything other than the white, blond, skinny doll that has epitomised western beauty ideals for so long. But when they do, at least there\u2019s a taller-than-average, possibly mixed-race Barbie with a supercool undercut just waiting to steal the show. Leah Harper Taiwan votes for Tsai Ing-wen     A supporter holds a picture of Tsai Ing-wen. Photograph: Ulet Ifansasti/Getty Images    In a year that saw America pass on the chance to elect its first female president, there was better news from Taiwan: Tsai Ing-wen rose to power as one of the rare self-made female Asian leaders to have succeeded through hard work rather than family connections. In January, she was elected Taiwan\u2019s first female president, becoming the most powerful woman in the Chinese-speaking world. Her Democratic Progressive party\u2019s landslide win was boosted by young voters disillusioned with stagnant economic growth and rising inequality, and desperate to assert their country\u2019s identity. Taiwan, an island of 23 million people about 100 miles off the Chinese coast, has its own government, currency and military, but is viewed by China as a renegade province. Most nations, wary of offending China, refuse to have formal diplomatic ties with it. However, US president-elect Donald Trump spoke with Tsai on the telephone in December, breaking decades of US foreign policy protocol. Tsai, a law professor and LSE graduate, came to power on the back of the Sunflower Movement of 2014, when students occupied government buildings and thousands took to the streets to protest at a trade deal with Beijing. It has, however, seen China retaliate by freezing diplomatic ties and allegedly restricting tourism to squeeze Taiwan\u2019s struggling economy. And as Tsai has walked the tricky line between public expectations on independence and increased jobs and prosperity, her approval rating has plummeted. But the president, who has been called the \u201cAngela Merkel of the east\u201d for her calm, academic style, appears unfazed. \u201cWe want to make Taiwan an Asian tiger once again,\u201d she wrote in the Economist in November. \u201cMy plan for 2017 is for Taiwan to renew its role as a pioneer.\u201d Nicola Smith Puddlewatch makes a splash           #Drummondpuddlewatch: the Periscope sensation that\u2019s making a splash    The first week of 2016 seems like an entirely different place. For proof, look at #DrummondPuddleWatch: a livestream of a large puddle in Newcastle. If this happened now, we would treat it differently. We\u2019d gnash our teeth about failing infrastructures, joylessly share overcooked thinkpieces about how the puddle was Brexit\u2019s fault, brace ourselves for the inevitable moment when president-elect Trump would call the puddle \u201csad\u201d on Twitter. But back in the glory days of early January, #DrummondPuddleWatch was a treat: a dog in the playground, the first glimpse of snow. There was real pleasure to be taken from the various ways people attempted to traverse the puddle: on tiptoe, via an island-hopping technique using a nearby lamp-post, or smashing through regardless. It was the most basic personality test, dividing people into varying layers of caution; at once breathtakingly mundane and staggeringly life-affirming. It felt spectacularly British then, and it feels spectacularly innocent now. At its peak, around 20,000 people were watching the puddle online. Before long, people brought lilos and surfboards with them. A crowd formed. Around a puddle. It felt like a moment in time, shared by all. One day, we\u2019ll sit our grandchildren down and tell them about the time 20,000 people watched an old lady leapfrog a puddle, and they won\u2019t believe us. \u201cWhat\u2019s a puddle?\u201d they\u2019ll ask through a gas mask in the concrete bunker they\u2019ve never left, and we\u2019ll be lost for words.

Photograph: Pete Souza/The White House    When Virginia McLaurin, aged 106, attended a White House reception in February, she wasn\u2019t sure if she would meet President Obama. \u201cWe were waiting and I kept asking, \u2018Where is he? Am I going to see him?\u2019\u201d she says, speaking from her home in Washington DC earlier this month, apologising for being hard of hearing. McLaurin, born in 1909, grew up on a sharecropping farm in South Carolina. She was used to one entrance for white people at the front of a house and another at the back for black people. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever live to see a black president,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I really didn\u2019t think a poor person like me would get a chance to go to the White House.\u201d McLaurin, known locally as Ms V, is an active community member: she still volunteers up to 40 hours a week at a special needs school and Sundays are for church. When she said she wanted to meet the Obamas, a neighbour contacted White House staff and she was invited to a Black History Month event.   Good news list   \u201cWhen I got close to him, I was so excited, I just grabbed him,\u201d she says. Video footage shows McLaurin, in a matching blue jacket and skirt, throwing her arms open, shouting, \u201cHi!\u201d and clasping hands with Obama. \u201cI grabbed her, too,\u201d she says of the first lady. In the video, the president jokes that McLaurin should slow down; Michelle Obama says, \u201cI want to be like you when I grow up.\u201d When McLaurin replies, \u201cYou can\u201d and wiggles her shoulders with excitement, the three are led in some dance steps by Michelle. As they gather for a photograph, the first lady exclaims, \u201cLook at those nails!\u201d McLaurin recalls they were the same blue as her suit and that her \u201cfiftysomething\u201d granddaughter had painted them. \u201cYou\u2019ll notice I had on boots. That was because I didn\u2019t have any shoes. But I thought, \u2018I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m going anyhow.\u2019\u201d When the video went viral, people heard of McLaurin\u2019s volunteering and poor living conditions, and she received donations to a Facebook page set up by her neighbour.

Photograph: Pete Dadds/BBC/PA    Paul Trueman has been a fan of The Archers for more than a decade, but at the start of this year, like millions of other devotees of the long-running Radio 4 soap, he found himself seized by one particular storyline. Helen Titchener, born a member of the titular farming family, now married to a manipulative bully named Rob, was being dragged ever more under his abusive control. Friends started spotting bruises. Now she was pregnant, and increasingly fearful for her young son. Among the soap\u2019s devoted fans on Twitter, Trueman noted, \u201cThere was a lot of, \u2018Why can\u2019t we do something? This is awful.\u2019 Then an idea popped into my head. If she were real, we could fundraise to get her out of there. So I thought, that\u2019s what we should do. We should start a fundraising page for a fictional character\u201d \u2013 with the profits going to help real-life victims of domestic violence. Within a couple of hours, Trueman had set up a page on the JustGiving website in aid of the charity Refuge, with a nominal target of \u00a31,000. \u201cI thought if we were lucky we might reach that in a month.\u201d That was around 9pm. His phone pinged five minutes later, the first alert that someone had donated money. By midnight, he had passed his target. \u201cAnd my phone didn\u2019t stop pinging for the next six months. It was bonkers.\u201d He didn\u2019t turn off the notifications, \u201cpartly because I loved getting them. It was just fantastic, a little bit of a drug.\u201d Within 48 hours, the total passed \u00a320,000; it was \u00a345,000 by the end of the first week. Most powerful, for Trueman, were the comments from those donating, many anonymous. \u201cTo the charity that saved me and my children, eternal thanks.\u201d \u201cI was a Helen. I came out the other side. There\u2019s a light there at the end of the tunnel.\u201d Ten months after Trueman\u2019s bright idea \u2013 and aided, he stresses, by many, many others \u2013 the site has raised more than \u00a3200,000 (including gift aid) for Refuge. It\u2019s still open for donations. \u201cNever before in my 33-year career at Refuge have I seen such public support for our work,\u201d says Sandra Horley, the charity\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt has been incredible to see this storyline, and one Archers fan from Devon, inspire so many members of the public to engage with something that goes on behind closed doors.\u201d \u201c2016 has sucked, don\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d Trueman says. \u201cBut I am quietly proud of the fact that, as a community, Archers listeners have been responsible for one of the bright sparks of the year.\u201d Esther Addley Pink beauty products get a reality check     Blue for a boy\u2026 Photograph: Marlene Ford/Alamy    It\u2019s long been the case that women pay more than men for virtually identical products such as plastic razors and face creams (typically branded pink for ladies, black or blue for men). In February, Boots bowed to consumer pressure over \u201csexist pricing\u201d of products by changing the cost of its razors and eye creams. The high street giant made the pledge after a change.org petition set up by campaigner Stevie Wise highlighted the disparity between equivalent products marketed at men and women. Since then, Boots has brought its No7 skincare range into line, ensuring products are sold for the same price across male and female ranges. Superdrug has also reviewed the pricing disparity and cut prices of its own-brand razors, adding that it is challenging suppliers that charge more for women\u2019s products. Argos, which came under fire after selling pink scooters for \u00a35 more than the same blue ones, claimed the discrepancy was an error that had been corrected. However, in September, the gender equality group Fawcett found in an analysis of supermarket own-brand toiletries (at Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons) that women are paying on average 31% more than men for a basket of comparable toiletries. Fawcett intends to keep up the pressure. Rebecca Smithers Teenage pregnancies plummet     Teenage pregnancy is now at its lowest level since records began. Photograph: Alamy    The Office for National Statistics published official figures that confirmed a staggering 51% drop in the rate of pregnancy among under-18s in less than two decades. It is now at its lowest level since records began in the late 1960s: in 1998, in England and Wales, 47 out of every 1,000 young women under 18 became pregnant; by 2014 (the figures published this year), that had plummeted to 23 out of every 1,000. The World Health Organisation is exploring how this turnaround was achieved and whether it can be replicated elsewhere. The key engine driving such dramatic change was an ambitious policy known as the teenage pregnancy strategy, launched by the Labour government in 1999. It was a 10-year project, almost unheard of in quick-fix government circles, with work carried out in schools and colleges, among youth and social workers. Teenage conception rates have also dropped worldwide, for similar reasons, including more widely available, high-quality sex education, and greater access to more effective contraception. Another theory is the advent of social media - youngsters are busy networking at home via Facebook and Instagram rather than meeting face-to-face over a six-pack of lager. Sally Weale A giant rabbit is rehomed     Home-seeking giant rabbit Atlas. Photograph: Scottish SPCA/PA    With spring came the story of Atlas, the giant bunny who was given a new home following a nationwide charity appeal by the Scottish SPCA. Atlas was a then seven-month-old continental giant rabbit, and about the size of a west highland terrier (too large for his previous owner). His new owner, Jen Hislop, 43, from North Ayrshire, was chosen from hundreds of applicants around the world who hoped to adopt the rabbit. \u201cI burst into tears when I got the phone call saying I had been chosen to rehome Atlas,\u201d said Hislop, who renamed him Attila The Bun Binky Master Jazz Paws \u2013 Atty, for short \u2013 and who was provided with a buggy to help get him around. The continental giant is one of the largest and oldest breeds of rabbits, and can grow to 1.2m long, weigh more than 20kg, and eat a bale of hay a week as well as up to 2,000 carrots and 700 apples a year.

The standout event was Donald Trump\u2019s surprise victory. The maverick Republican\u2019s defeat of Hillary Clinton produced a shock that reverberated around the world. The billionaire\u2019s White House tenancy begins on 20 January. Many will dub that date Black Friday, fearful that Trumpism may irreparably damage international security, environmental protection and human rights. Others will see it as a sign of welcome change. It will be a year of living dangerously. Yet 2016 was remarkable for many other reasons \u2013 good and bad. The fightback against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq gathered pace, even as terrorist atrocities took lives from Nice to Jakarta. A peace deal was signed in Colombia, ending the world\u2019s longest-running insurgency. The European Union was thrown into confusion by Britain\u2019s vote to leave. The Paris agreement marked a breakthrough on climate change.  Elections and referendums Trump\u2019s protectionist, isolationist stance brought into question the inevitability of globalisation, suggesting a return to a pre-1939 age of economic nationalism, punitive tariffs, trade barriers, controls on movement of labour and capital, closed markets and minds.  Many hope Trump will take a more pragmatic, less iconoclastic line. But he questioned the usefulness of international institutions such as the United Nations, the World Bank and Nato. He cast doubt on key security alliances in Asia. Trump also ignited concern for April\u2019s Paris climate change deal.  Trump\u2019s stated support for the unilateral waging of war, for authoritarian governance, torture, indefinite detention without trial, and religious and racial profiling of immigrants and refugees could, if copied, destroy the universal legal and human rights protections erected via the UN system since 1945. The first world leader Trump spoke to after his victory was Egypt\u2019s military coup leader, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, giving a chilling insight into his priorities. Britain\u2019s narrow 52%-48% referendum vote in June in favour of leaving the EU was unexpected. Many drew parallels with the US, saying similar nationalist, populist forces were at work, fuelled by anger that globalisation and accompanying immigration were undermining low-paid workers\u2019 way of life.      Supporters of the Stronger In campaign react as results of Britain\u2019s EU referendum are announced. Photograph: Rob Stothard/AFP/Getty Images    If the British government\u2019s timetable holds, Brexit will begin in March, when the UK will formally file for divorce. Tough negotiations are expected, focused on freedom of movement (which Britain wants to curtail) and unfettered UK access to the single market (which other EU members oppose).  Divisions within Britain over Brexit can be expected to deepen, especially if sterling devalues further, and, as expected, the cost of living rises sharply. Political strains in Europe will further complicate the post-Brexit picture. France will hold a presidential election in spring. Marine Le Pen, of the far-right National Front, is expected to do very well. Le Pen wants France to quit the EU and euro. Her main challenger is likely to be Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, a Catholic Thatcherite, for the centre right. The Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, will not stand for re-election. In the Netherlands\u2019 March general election, the Islamophobe Geert Wilders could prove an influential warm-up act for Le Pen. Wilders advocates a Dutch \u201cNexit\u201d.

Angela Merkel is seeking re-election for a fourth term as chancellor, but faces strong opposition from the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany.  All this internal uncertainty may paralyse the EU in 2017 as it faces record refugee influxes, chronic eurozone weakness, threats from Russia and an uncertain partner in Washington. The fashionable idea that Merkel will pick up the torch from Obama and become defender-in-chief of western liberal democracy looks like wishful thinking. Conflicts and terrorism Despite repeated UN attempts at peace, Syria\u2019s civil war passed the five-year mark in 2016 and approached a bloody denouement. Russia\u2019s intervention made a decisive difference. Western-backed rebels were pushed back. The regime of President Bashar al-Assad was encouraged to believe it could survive. The siege of eastern Aleppo became a symbol of the suffering and brutality of the Syrian war. Children were killed or maimed in large numbers. Hospitals and schools were repeatedly hit and UN relief supplies were suspended after an aid convoy was strafed. In September, the US, Britain and France staged a diplomatic protest at the UN security council, accusing Russia\u2019s forces and leaders of possible war crimes and threatening new sanctions. Moscow was unmoved. Backed by Assad\u2019s other main ally, Iran, Russia claimed the west was supporting jihadi terrorists and pursuing illegal regime change. By year\u2019s end, the battle for Aleppo appeared over as rebel resistance crumbled. The evacuation of wounded civilians began amid reports of renewed atrocities. Assad and Iran claimed \u201cvictory\u201d. And fears grew that the civil war would be superseded by a new struggle between external forces for control of land and resources.  In Iraq, an offensive to retake Mosul from Isis got bogged down. The war in Yemen showed no sign of abating, notwithstanding a furore in Britain and the US about arms sales to Saudi Arabia, whose airstrikes are blamed for numerous civilian deaths. In Libya, a new threat from Isis emerged, centred on the late Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s stronghold in Sirte, prompting fierce fighting.      Pupils gather at their school in Saada, Yemen, after it was hit by a Saudi-led airstrike. Photograph: Naif Rahma/Reuters    Isis was also active in Afghanistan, challenging the Taliban for control of rural areas. Afghanistan is now America\u2019s longest war. More than 8,000 US troops are still based there, though Nato combat forces have left. Will Trump try to finish it in 2017, as Obama vainly tried to do in 2009? Or will he cut and run, leaving the Afghans to fight it out? Trump says defeating Isis is his top priority abroad. He appointed Michael Flynn, a former general who has claimed it is rational to fear Muslims, as national security adviser \u2013 one of several nominations of hawks to key posts. The thought that he could be tasked with fulfilling Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cbomb the shit out of Isis\u201d unnerved observers.  The year is likely to see a narrowing American focus on hitting Isis in the caliphate\u2019s heartlands around Mosul and Raqqa in Syria, where the jihadis are besieged by Iraqi and Kurdish forces. The Isis threat will persist, however. Western security agencies fear displaced jihadis could make their way in increasing numbers to Europe in 2017, bent on launching attacks like those in Brussels in March, which killed 32 people, and Nice in July, in which 86 died. Jihadi websites celebrated Trump\u2019s election, anticipating a surge in recruits.  Given this polarisation, the global spread of Islamist extremism is likely to continue. In Nigeria, Boko Haram is undefeated, despite the freeing of many schoolgirls abducted in 2014.  Muslim majority countries such as Pakistan, Indonesia and Bangladesh face continuing threats. In Dhaka in July, 20 hostages died in a restaurant attack by home-grown jihadis targeting westerners and non-Muslims. In Quetta in October, more than 50 young police recruits died in a massacre blamed on Isis.     A vigil in Dhaka after a terrorist attack at a restaurant in July. Photograph: Zakir Chowdhury/Barcroft Images    Democracy and dictators  Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, will keep his title of the west\u2019s top bogeyman in 2017. Syria aside, Russia\u2019s military build-up along its border with the Baltic republics, its meddling in Ukraine, and its covert political influence-peddling, disinformation campaigns and cyber warfare in eastern Europe are expected to accelerate. Trump\u2019s refusal to criticise Putin suggested the US and Russia may see some kind of realpolitik compromise and a return to the concept of \u201cspheres of influence\u201d \u2013 a prospect that deeply alarms many Nato states. Trump\u2019s nomination of the Exxon Mobil oilman Rex Tillerson, a Putin pal, as secretary of state added to the unease. If Trump tries another Russian \u201creset\u201d, the likelihood is that Putin will take what he wants and leave the rest.  Putin has been building bridges to Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president. This alliance of convenience will create more headaches for the west in 2017. Xi has enlisted Russia\u2019s support in conducting military \u201cexercises\u201d around disputed South China Sea islands, where Beijing is rapidly expanding its presence. China defied a 2016 UN court ruling deeming its activities illegal.     A billboard in Shandong province with the slogan: \u2018South China Sea, our beautiful motherland, we won\u2019t let go an inch.\u2019 Photograph: AP    Even before taking office, Trump went on the offensive against China, speaking to Taiwan\u2019s president and questioning the long-established One China policy, under which the US accepts Beijing\u2019s sovereignty. Beijing\u2019s response to Trump was initially angry yet restrained. But there were fears the Taiwan issue might escalate militarily in 2017. Internally, Beijing\u2019s harsh treatment of democrats seeking independence for Hong Kong mirrored what commentators called the biggest crackdown on civil rights and free speech in mainland China since Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution. The nuclear brinkmanship of North Korea\u2019s paranoid regime increased regional tensions. This problem will possibly come to a head in 2017. Kim Jong-un, the country\u2019s dictator, conducted an underground nuclear test in September, the fifth and biggest, involving nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. In Tokyo, there were calls for Japanese rearmament. Trump suggested Japan and South Korea acquire nuclear weapons. His threat to tear up Obama\u2019s 2015 pact with Iran stoked fears that Tehran may seek to acquire nuclear weapons, sparking a regional arms race and confrontation between Iran and Israel. Like a mafia boss, Trump demanded Japan and South Korea pay more for US bases. In Seoul, scandal forced President Park Geun-hye to resign. All this uncertainty suggests 2017 could be a problematic year for global nuclear non-proliferation efforts. Democracy in south-east Asia fared little better. The death of Thailand\u2019s King Bhumibol Adulyadej further bolstered Bankok\u2019s military junta.  In Myanmar, there was better news. Aung San Suu Kyi, the veteran opposition leader, became the country\u2019s de facto leader, appearing at the UN in September. But her failure to condemn repression of the Muslim minority reflected the fragility of her position.  The biggest regional upset was in the Philippines, where the foul-mouthed Rodrigo Duterte was elected president. Thousands of alleged gangsters and drug-dealers have since died in a government crackdown. Duterte admitted killing alleged criminals. Protests from the US and UN prompted him to turn to China for support, repudiating the long-standing US alliance.      Mourners in Caloocan city, Philippines, pay respects to Jerico Camitan, 21, who was shot with his partner, 17. A placard placed nearby said they were drug pushers. Photograph: Jes Aznar/Getty Images    In Latin America, the so-called \u201cred tide\u201d of leftwing governments receded amid civil unrest in Venezuela, the crime-ridden home of the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s Bolivarian revolution. From Argentina and Chile to Ecuador and Bolivia, the left was in retreat. In Brazil, the country\u2019s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, was ousted by rightwing foes. Exceptions were Nicaragua, where the veteran Sandinista Daniel Ortega was re-elected president; and Cuba, where the socialist regime hosted Barack Obama. His visit seemed to confirm the Cuban revolution\u2019s survival after bitter US enmity, although Trump may try to turn the clock back. Fidel Castro, Cuba\u2019s iconic leader, died. He was hailed as a historic figure and condemned as a tyrant. In Colombia, a peace deal with the Farc rebels was repudiated in a referendum, but continued to be honoured during a review. In Africa, Burundi\u2019s president followed his Rwandan counterpart in overturning the constitution and grabbing a third consecutive term in office, causing considerable instability. In Uganda, Yoweri Museveni extended what looks like a presidency-for-life amid claims of poll fraud. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, presidential elections were postponed, while the Gambia\u2019s president, Yahya Jammeh, ceded electoral defeat, then refused to step down.  Yet Africa\u2019s democratic deficit was often unfairly exaggerated. In its 2016 report, Freedom House identified Nigeria, Liberia and Ivory Coast among countries experiencing big advances in political rights and civil liberties. It also praised Botswana, Ghana, Cape Verde and Benin. When Africans consider the US in 2017, the self-appointed champion of democracy, they may feel blessed. Next time a western politician complains about Robert Mugabe\u2019s depredations in Zimbabwe, the ready reply will be: just look at Donald Trump."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/26/pearl-harbor-anniversary-obama-japan-shinzo-abe", "publicationDate": "2016-12-26T10:30:40Z", "tags": ["Japan", "Second world war", "Shinzo Abe", "Obama administration", "Barack Obama", "Donald Trump"], "sentences": ["His phone conversation with the leader of Taiwan threatened to upend relations with Beijing, whereas his first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader following his election was with Abe."], "title": "'Alliance of hope': US and Japan leaders meet for historic Pearl Harbor first", "article": "With $12.50 \u2013 half a month\u2019s salary \u2013 in his pocket, Harold Mainer was about to go ashore to celebrate his friend\u2019s birthday. Then, just before 8am, came the angry buzz of hundreds of Japanese warplanes, swarming the sky and raining destruction. The surprise attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor had begun. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it was happening but it did happen,\u201d recalls Mainer, 95, who had been standing on the deck of the USS Helena, a light cruiser, when the serenity was shattered. \u201cThe first three bombs I saw. One hit the waterway, the other one hit the runway, the other one hit the hangar deck. You didn\u2019t have time to think. You just did what you were trying to do.\u201d President Franklin Roosevelt declared it \u201ca date which will live in infamy\u201d, and soon the US would be embroiled in the second world war. But Mainer, who survived the Helena being torpedoed and used a water hose to wash away the remains of a fallen comrade, reflects: \u201cWe knew war had started before he declared war. We knew they weren\u2019t going to get away with it.\u201d Seventy-five years after the raid that left 2,403 Americans dead and 19 vessels sunk or crippled, American and Japanese heads of state are to stand together at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii for the first time. Barack Obama and Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, will visit the USS Arizona memorial on 27 December to honour those killed and, says the White House, \u201cshowcase the power of reconciliation\u201d, though Abe is not likely to offer an apology. The event comes seven months after Obama became the first American president to travel to Hiroshima, where the US dropped an atomic bomb in 1945 \u2013 the other bookend of the war in the Pacific. Among the dwindling band of veterans, not all have been disposed to endorse such gestures but Mainer, for one, is content for Abe to set foot in Pearl Harbor. \u201cIf that\u2019s what he wants to do, that\u2019s all right with me,\u201d he said, attending a commemoration in Washington on the recent 75th anniversary of the attack. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. I have no anger. \u201cI was talking to a school one time and there was a little eight-year-old boy. He says, \u2018Can I ask you something?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah, sure.\u2019 He asked me my feelings about the Japanese people. It threw me. I thought to myself and said: \u2018I tell you what, them Japanese sailors felt they were right, the same as I felt I was right, but I said in the end it proved that I was right. He was satisfied with it and everybody else was satisfied with it, and I thought that was about as a good an answer as I could give.\u201d Symbolism has been a key part of the Obama presidency \u2013 for example, his visit to Cuba earlier this year. He promised a \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d during his eights years in office with mixed results. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, once declared by Abe a crucial \u201cpillar\u201d of future US influence, has been doomed by the election of Donald Trump as his successor. But the US-Japan relationship could be more important than ever as Trump spars with the region\u2019s biggest power, China. His phone conversation with the leader of Taiwan threatened to upend relations with Beijing, whereas his first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader following his election was with Abe. Abe will not, as had been initially reported, be the first Japanese leader to go to Pearl Harbor. In 1951 the then prime minister, Shigeru Yoshida, visited the US national cemetery in Honolulu and the US military command centre facing Pearl Harbor. Abe, though, will be the first Japanese leader to pay tribute at the memorial to the sunken USS Arizona and to be accompanied by the American president. There is overwhelming support among the Japanese public for Abe\u2019s visit: according to a Kyodo News poll at the weekend, 85.3% agreed that he should go to the site, while 10.9% disagreed. Koichi Nakano, professor of Japanese politics at Sophia University in Tokyo, believes the visit is an attempt by Abe to underscore the strength of the US-Japan alliance \u201cbefore Trump, who is a potentially destabilising factor, assumes office\u201d. Nakano added: \u201cThe fact that he is visiting Pearl Harbor without offering an apology makes it look like he is merely using the historic site for political purposes.\u201d Abe\u2019s critics say he appears willing to make conciliatory gestures to US audiences, while resisting demands to do the same from Japan\u2019s former enemies in Asia. South Korea and China have long insisted that Japan has yet to properly apologise for its wartime conduct, and have accused Abe of attempting to rewrite the darker episodes of his country\u2019s wartime history.

Photograph: Kimimasa Mayama/EPA     Related: Anger of wartime sex slaves haunts Japan and South Korea    He has, for example, denied that tens of thousands of \u201ccomfort women\u201d, mainly from the Korean peninsula, were coerced by the Japanese imperial army into working as sex slaves in frontline military brothels. At a joint session of the US Congress in April last year, he offered \u201ceternal condolences\u201d for the loss of American lives during the war and acknowledged that Japan had caused \u201csuffering to the peoples of Asian countries\u201d, but did not mention specific wartime atrocities. In August that year, he marked the 70th anniversary of the end of the Pacific war with an expression of \u201cdeep remorse\u201d, but stopped short of issuing a fresh apology, adding that future generations of Japanese should not be \u201cpredestined\u201d to apologise for the actions of militarist governments during the first half of the 20th century. \u201cThe Japanese people have long since accepted the notion that Japan was defeated by the US \u2013 but not by China,\u201d Nakano said. \u201cEven the conservatives have largely come to accommodate the fact that they were given a second chance in the postwar period by the US victors. So, for the prime minister to visit Pearl Harbor is a non-issue in Japan. On the other hand, apologising to China and Korea, visiting Nanjing or meeting former \u2018comfort women\u2019 would be infinitely harder for him to do.\u201d Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University, agreed that Abe hoped to put the past behind both countries and \u201ccreate positive momentum as he enters an unpredictable relationship with Trump\u201d. \u201cIt is mostly about the photo op, but given Abe\u2019s revisionist views on history that glorify imperial Japan and exonerate it from wartime misdeed, he is not the most credible messenger on reconciliation.\u201d Obama\u2019s visit to Hiroshima in May \u201cconveyed remorse because of his public stance against nuclear weapons, while Abe\u2019s record of rehabilitating the wartime past means that his presence does not convey a similar sincerity and contrition,\u201d he added. At the time, Trump, then a presidential candidate, tweeted: \u201cDoes President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he\u2019s in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost.\u201d       A Japanese government official, who did not wish to be named, said Abe\u2019s visit reflected his desire for reconciliation and to reiterate his belief that the US and Japan must continue to build an \u201calliance of hope\u201d in the face of new regional threats from China and North Korea. At a recent briefing in Washington, the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest struck a similar note. Asked if some veterans might be angered if Abe did not apologise, he replied: \u201cYes, there may be some who feel personally embittered. But I\u2019m confident that many will set aside their own personal bitterness, not because they\u2019re personally satisfied by the words of the prime minister, but because they recognise how important this moment is for the United States. And that\u2019s certainly why they qualify to be described as the greatest generation.\u201d   Related: The man who survived Hiroshima: 'I had entered a living hell on earth'    It was a comment that could comfortably be applied to Mainer, the 95-year-old veteran from Charleston, Arkansas.

Translators have grown weary of being associated with certain topics. Readers have stopped buying. And the whole industry is wondering if hard-hitting books on Chinese politics still have a future in the former British colony.    Related: Hong Kong protesters march over abducted booksellers    The booksellers involved, formerly known only to a small niche of insiders, have now become household names in Hong Kong: Gui Minhai, a Swedish citizen, remains jailed in an undisclosed location in China after he was kidnapped from his holiday home in Thailand. Lee Bo, a British national who was lifted off the streets of Hong Kong and taken to China against his will has been released and allowed to return, but has consistently refused to give a full account of what has happened to him. He remains in China. Lui Por and Cheung Chi-ping, two clerks at Causeway Bay Books, the bookshop at the centre of the case, disappeared while on a visit to Shenzhen. They are also formally free, but live across the border where they have refused to entertain calls from the press and former associates.  The booksellers were pressured into televised confessions broadcast on national TV, in which they admitted to a variety of crimes \u2013 from a hit-and-run incident to mailing to sending Chinese clients forbidden Hong Kong books without a licence. Only Lam Wing-kee has jumped bail while on a visit to Hong Kong in June to retrieve a computer database.

Political sensitivities \u2026 President Xi Jinping of China. Photograph: Fred Dufour/EPA    Nobody knows exactly why the authorities in China decided to crack down on Causeway Bay Books, though it is thought that the final straw is likely to have been a salacious work about China\u2019s president Xi Jinping\u2019s relationship with women that was about to be published.  Bao Pu, co-founder of New Century Press (a publishing house that specialises in highbrow political books), says that controls at the border with Hong Kong have been getting stricter in the past few years \u2013 \u201cand ever more so since the establishment of the Southern Hill Project in 2010\u201d. This refers to the code name of a campaign launched by the Chinese authorities to counter the influence of the Hong Kong publishing industry, which was seen as growing exponentially.  As more Chinese visitors had been allowed to travel to Hong Kong withoutvisas, shopping for politically revealing books forbidden in the rest of the country had become widespread. Some had been dubbed \u201cdemocracy tourists\u201d by activists who\u2019d see them also taking part, or observing, pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong.  Until the Causeway Bay case, these books were easy to buy, allowing Chinese citizens to gain a glimpse \u2013 not always truthful \u2013 of the inner workings of their opaque leaders. At the airport, in 24-hour convenience shops and in regular bookstores, political books about the Communist party, the People\u2019s Liberation Army and individual leaders were readily available next to milk powder and traditional medicines, two of the other items particularly sought-after by Chinese tourists.  This is no longer the case. Since April, the 16 bookstores at the Hong Kong International Airport have been cut down to 10. The biggest five are now controlled by Chung Hwa Book Co, a company that was established in Shanghai in 1912 and is now under Sino United Publishing, a mainland-backed conglomerate that owns most Hong Kong bookshops \u2013 and where the \u201cforbidden\u201d books are mostly unavailable.  Critical, gossipy books have also disappeared from the ubiquitous 7-Eleven stores and other 24-hour mini-supermarkets. A clerk at a 7-Eleven outlet in Hollywood Road, a central street well-known to tourists for its antique shops, only says that this was a decision by the management, as the books were \u201cstill selling\u201d. She declines to give her name, and 7-Eleven, now owned by Dairy Farm, a pan-Asian retailer part of the Jardine Matheson Group, has not replied to a written request for an interview.     Tourism to Hong Kong by mainland Chinese citizens has grown dramatically \u2013 giving more people access to critical or salacious publications. Photograph: Dale de la Rey/AFP/Getty Images    Independent bookstores, on the other hand, have been deserted by their former customers, and some have had to close down. One of them is 1908 Books, a bookstore in the Tsim Sha Tsui district that stocked only political books and magazines. It shut its doors earlier this year without any public announcement. In November, Page One, a large Singapore-owned bilingual chain that occasionally carried political books in Chinese, withdrew from Hong Kong entirely.  A handful of independent bookstores do survive, but they all belong to the \u201csecond-floor bookshops\u201d category: operating from higher floors of commercial buildings and harder to find for visitors unfamiliar with Hong Kong. One example is People\u2019s Coffee and Books, also located in Causeway Bay, which doubles as a cafe. It is still carrying all the troublesome volumes, but owner Paul Tang says it is seeing far fewer customers than at this time last year. And in an unexpected twist, the Causeway Bay Books outlet \u2013 still closed to the public \u2013 was purchased by a Chinese national. One aim of the Southern Hill Project is to put pressure on tour guides: \u201cThe Tourism Bureau ensures that travellers bound for Hong Kong and Taiwan receive warnings and are subject to propaganda, and tour guides are given the responsibility to remind, discourage and prevent tourists from buying publications that are deemed politically harmful to bring back to China,\u201d says Bao.      Deemed harmful \u2026 books banned on the Chinese mainland on sale in a Hong Kong market last February. Many such titles have now been withdrawn. Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP    The clampdown is not only affecting what bookstores can sell but the books that are now available to them, with fewer books being published in the first place. \u201cThe bookseller incident not only sets new boundaries but also reinforces the norm, which is to publish in journals instead of books,\u201d says Edmund Cheng, an associate professor at Hong Kong Baptist University.  \u201cThe former\u2019s audience is restricted to peers and students but matters a lot in academics\u2019 livelihoods and in the ranking of universities. But in this way, academic publication\u2019s usage in the public sphere is undermined. So authoritarian protocol and market logic work quite well together.\u201d  It has been a slow shift away from freer days, as Cheng underlines: \u201cThe self-censorship started before the booksellers\u2019 case: after the umbrella movement [the pro-democracy protests that began in September 2014], it was no longer easy to publish critical books written by academics,\u201d he says. \u201cTitles, in particular, can no longer carry certain words, like \u2018social movement\u2019. If you have those in your title, you are no longer invited to conferences, especially on the mainland.\u201d Timothy O\u2019Leary, head of the school of humanities at Hong Kong University, confirms this: \u201cThe effect is more likely to be a slow undermining of willingness to publish in politically sensitive areas,\u201d he says, as academics and writers alike shy away from potential trouble.     Problems finding translators \u2026 author Mei Fong. Photograph: Andrew Lih    Even translators have become weary. Mei Fong, author of One Child: The Story Of China\u2019s Most Radical Experiment, a book about the one-child policy and its consequences published in English this year, tried unsuccessfully to have her book distributed in Chinese.  \u201cI wanted to reach the audience that has been most touched by the topic I analyse,\u201d she says. But \u201cafter trying unsuccessfully to have the book published in China, I looked for a Hong Kong publisher, which is how books on \u2018banned\u2019 topics used to reach readers in the mainland. I was told that the problem with the book was not so much the sensitivities, but the difficulty in finding a distributor. Yet even before that, my translator pulled out,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I commissioned my own translator, who asked to remain anonymous, but even then I could not find a publisher, neither in Hong Kong, because of the consequences of the five booksellers\u2019 disappearance, nor in Taiwan, where books about China are not very popular.\u201d She decided to attempt a new approach, allowing the Chinese version of her book to be be downloaded for free, with the possibility of contributing a voluntary fee to cover costs. It\u2019s not clear how long her experiment can last before the mainland censors pull the plug on her website.  \u201cEverybody is scared,\u201d says Renee Chiang, of New Century Press. \u201cThe printers \u2026 are not willing to print political books. And the bookshops are not willing to stock political books, because now it is considered dangerous. But since the majority of the readers of this kind of work are visitors from the mainland, now that the customs officers have increased their surveillance and confiscation of political books, they are no longer buying them. So at both ends of the chain we have problems.\u201d Given the climate in Hong Kong, printers do not see their refusal to print as a political decision, but purely a business one. AsiaOne, which used to print political books without worries, has ceased doing so \u2013 but nobody at the company agreed to be interviewed. Jason Chan, of printing company Sun-Design, says that \u201ctruly speaking, the booksellers\u2019 case has a bad influence on the publishers and the booksellers still working in Hong Kong. I still believe that Hong Kong is a safe place to work, so I haven\u2019t rejected any book\u2019s printing yet because of political reasons. Nowadays, the volume of books printed is going down, but the impact has been [great] only on specific bookstores and publishers,\u201d he says. Authors, too, are feeling the pinch. Yu Jie, a mainland author of politically sensitive books, saw his contract for a new book on Xi with the publishers of Open Magazine \u2013 a monthly that tries to follow the party\u2019s power struggles \u2013 rescinded after the chief editor, Jin Zhong, left Hong Kong under pressure from his family. The book was eventually published in Taiwan to a much smaller audience. Meanwhile, given the prohibitive costs of keeping unsold stock, some publishers have resorted to pulping political books that had no chance of getting distributed.  According to the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong\u2019s main English language paper, Sophie Choi \u2013 Lee Bo\u2019s wife \u2013 ordered \u201c45,000 books critical of the Communist party destroyed\u201d in the hope of facilitating her husband\u2019s release. Other publishers, too, have privately admitted to destroying political books that cannot be distributed and sold.  The damage done to the Hong Kong publishing industry is unprecedented. \u201cSince 1949, Hong Kong had always been the place where books about China could be published. Its role was huge, way beyond the size of Hong Kong and its readership. This is why to this day scholars from China and from all over the world come to Hong Kong: to be able to see sensitive material,\u201d says Bao. \u201cThis is now disappearing.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/dec/29/best-read-travel-stories-of-2016-beaches-city-breaks-walks", "publicationDate": "2016-12-29T06:30:56Z", "tags": ["Travel websites", "Travel"], "sentences": ["Having realised how anglocentric my reading was, I decided to try to read a novel, short story collection or memoir from every UN-recognised country, plus former UN member Taiwan (then 196 nations in all), in a calendar year."], "title": "The best-read travel stories of 2016", "article": "1.

Accounts for Dunlop Slazenger International, a subsidiary of Sports Direct, indicate the company had a \u00a39.2m pension deficit in April 2015, with sales of \u00a330.6m for the 12 months to 26 April and a loss of more than \u00a320m. Sports Direct has said it is only selling the Dunlop brand \u2013 best known for its green flash tennis shoes. It will retain Slazenger, the supplier of Wimbledon\u2019s tennis balls. Pensions expert John Ralfe, who recently advised a parliamentary committee inquiry into the handling of the BHS pension fund, said: \u201cWill the new owners be guaranteeing the pension obligations of the company they are buying?\u201d  He added that new legislation should be brought in to ensure that such guarantees were given in future. Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions select committee, said the Pensions Regulator should be closely examining the Dunlop deal and publicly flagging up any issues. \u201cWhat can be gained by the regulator\u2019s secrecy?\u201d he said. Sports Direct should \u201cgive reassurance that it is not going to dump the deficit on the pension protection fund and the regulator should be active and reviewing this\u201d, he said. The regulator declined to comment on a specific case and said seeking clearance was a voluntary matter. MPs have called for the pension regulator to be given powers to veto takeover deals which put too much strain on pension schemes, among a raft of measures they believe could help avoid a rerun of the situation at retailer BHS, which collapsed in April and prompted recriminations about its \u00a3571m pension deficit. It is unclear whether the pension deficit has changed since the accounts for the year to April 2015 were filed. Sports Direct declined to comment, citing confidentiality and stock market rules. In a statement to the stock market earlier this week, Sports Direct said the Dunlop business made a pretax profit of \u00a34m on sales of \u00a341.8m this year, figures which it said were unaudited.  Accounts filed for the Dunlop Slazenger group in 2015 at Companies House show a \u00a322.3m loss. The group was technically insolvent, with more liabilities than assets but the accounts state that Dunlop Slazenger remained a going concern as working capital was financed by Sports Direct. Sports Direct\u2019s founder and major shareholder, Mike Ashley, acquired Dunlop Slazenger for an estimated \u00a340m in 2004 from Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 which had taken control of the struggling business from its private equity-backed owners. The company is selling Dunlop to a Japanese buyer in a surprise $137.5m (\u00a3112m) deal. Sumitomo Rubber Industries, which already owns the Dunlop rights in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, confirmed that it will acquire the remaining international rights to the brand, as well as its sporting goods and licensing businesses. The deal is scheduled to be completed in May 2017. As part of the deal it has granted Sports Direct a royalty free licence to continue to usethe Dunlop brand for premium workwear and safety wear sold in its own stores. Last year, Dunlop Slazenger\u2019s sales were about half the \u00a358m recorded in the year before Ashley took over the group. In 2003 it made a \u00a35.5m loss while its pension deficit stood at \u00a313.3m. Sumitomo did not respond to a request for comment."}]}
